  Turn off all the note takers, you don't have to worry about that. Thank you. Yeah, you can let everybody in.  Okay, got it.

0:18 - Anke Jordaan
  Hello. Hello.

0:21 - Charis Siau
  Hello.

0:23 - Ryan Cash
  Hey, everyone.

0:25 - Charis Siau
  Hi. How's it going? Definitely crunch time.

0:35 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  We like being ambitious here, so it's all good. At it's not the end of the month. That's true. Awesome.  Well, I have got a lot to chat about with you guys, but looks like the only thing, so none of you have added anything that you want to discuss here.  Is that right? Okay.

0:58 - Charis Siau
  I... I... I did not recall to add anything to the agenda, but I do have discussions. My bad on that.

1:08 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay. Do you want to tell us what they are so we know what kind of time that we have?

1:13 - Charis Siau
  Yeah, just the deal that we were discussing about your lawyer's client. It's all related to that. It's just about getting some clarity around the SDE, some of those figures.  And I know Anke had sent a message about that earlier, too, about going through the clients and figuring out the min and the max.

1:33 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So it's just good on that.

1:35 - Charis Siau
  Great.

1:36 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay, cool.

1:38 - Ryan Cash
  I just got off the call with a couple different brokers and just a couple questions about a call that I was on for a potential Federico deal.  But I wouldn't expect it to take too much time. Cool.

1:58 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Good. So... So the agenda, if you guys in the future have points that you want to talk to, you just drop them in here, and then that way we kind of know how to manage time, or I can skip things that aren't super urgent, too, and save them for future times.  So that helps us manage the time there. Okay, Anke, you moved it around. There we go. Great. Great. Let's go through the team's questions first, Anke, and then we can go through my stuff.

2:33 - Anke Jordaan
  Okay. All right. Let me share my screen so everybody can take a look at the agenda. I'm just moving stuff up and down, adding things as you guys are talking about them.
  SCREEN SHARING: Anke started screen sharing - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/379999240?timestamp=158.401361  All right. So on the agenda points, so we've got Cash's first write-up, we've got Charis's questions for the lawyers in the SDE, Cash has a question for AFR, and then Athena has two things that she wants to talk to.  So let's start with the write-up. No, ma'am.

2:59 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  I have a... bunch of things in there. You got to put that arrow down.

3:06 - Anke Jordaan
  Your format doesn't allow me to do the bullet points anymore.

3:11 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  I don't know how to do that. One of the other agendas lets you do bullet points, but this one doesn't.

3:16 - Anke Jordaan
  So maybe you can change the template.

3:18 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  I'll fix the template. Cool. Yeah, I got a lot to go through.

3:24 - Anke Jordaan
  All right. So let's start with the first write-up thing.

3:29 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, so I already fed back on a lot of this. Cash, really, over to you. Did you need any clarity on any of my points?

3:36 - Ryan Cash
  Did that all make sense? I have been so inundated with other activities that I have not had a chance to go through the notes that you posted on that.  Okay, no worries.

3:49 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So we can leave that to the channel discussion then. So why you go through that? Let me know if you have any questions there.  I think it was a really strong first write-up. So just... Just cleaning up and giving some clarity to the clients.  But otherwise, really excited to get something like that in front of him because he's been asking for that for a long time.

4:09 - Ryan Cash
  So well done on that. Well, if he likes it, Luke's got a really big whale of one that he can add to the mix as well.  Right, Luke?

4:18 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, I got a bigger one if he likes that small one. So let's ask me about that once you hear back from him on this small one.  Yeah. Is there a reason we're not putting it in front of him?

4:30 - Luke Gillespie
  Oh, no, I guess we're just going to wait to hear his feedback here because Steve does options trading, like stock options.  And that's like the stock market, the equity market is very different than the crypto market. So he said yes to crypto related.

4:43 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So maybe he's active in the crypto market, but, you know, crypto is just a much different niche. So it's a larger whale of a crypto newsletter?

4:52 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah, yeah, like content side, yeah.

4:55 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay, you still didn't answer. Why aren't you wanting to put it in front of him?

5:00 - Luke Gillespie
  Oh, because it's literally after we did the write-up for this deal, the same broker said, hey, if he's interested, I have this much larger one too.  He sent us the P&L and SIM. I forwarded that to cash and I said, if Steve likes this smaller one, maybe you should turn this bigger one into a write-up as well.  I don't think it's an if situation.

5:17 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  We know that Steve wants bigger deals and that they want to access private debt for that. This one is not meeting their SDE minimum, so I don't think it's an if.  Why not put it in front of them?

5:30 - Luke Gillespie
  All right. All right, Cash. Unless there's something I'm not hearing, but guys, it's not give them one write-up at a time.

5:37 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  We're going to drown them in deal flow so that they find their business as long as they're good deals.  We know that this is a wild card because it's... Is this other big whale one? Is it a US one or is it also a foreign one?

5:52 - Luke Gillespie
  I haven't done any big deals in Sony yet.

5:54 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah. So the one we're putting in front of them, there's a lot of hair. It's not the SDE minimum.  You know, so... But like, let's not deny them another opportunity when we know this is something that Steve's been asking for for a really long time.

6:06 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah, it's just like I said, crypto is very different than equity. So cash, maybe when you talk to him, just gauge his interest level on crypto.

6:15 - Ryan Cash
  Will do. I'll take a look at that other one, Luke. We'll get that out.

6:18 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Luke, for clarity, though, Steve wanted content sites and newsletters. He wasn't saying it specifically had to be traded.

6:27 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah, that's true. So I guess what I'm saying and what we seem to keep going around in circles in is Luke saying, like, see if he's interested.  I'm saying, please proceed on this.

6:39 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  OK.

6:40 - Luke Gillespie
  OK, Cash. Yeah, I got it.

6:44 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  For Cash and Charis's reference, the smaller deals are always less of a ideal situation for the clients. Right. So like something that the SCE is much lower than what they want.  Yeah. Bear in mind, they're still going to have to pay all the legal freeze. All All Bar fees, et cetera, et cetera.  So it's not a direct hit. So if we have an opportunity that can deliver more money, Steve has the experience that he does.  He has the appetite for private debt and has asked for larger deals as a result of that. If we have something that ticks all those boxes, like we also want to put that in front of them.  cause the money, the money thing is pretty much the biggest like disappointment for them if it's not, if it's not hitting the financial metrics.  So that's why that's the first thing that we use when we start eliminating deals is like what the number is, which is a great segue into Charis's question around the SDE.  But, um, yeah, so good cash. You can run that one down also.

7:45 - Ryan Cash
  Excited. Cool.

7:47 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Amazing. Um, all right. So, uh, Charis, let me, while we're on that thought, the SDE minimum and maximum, talk me through what you guys understand.  That to be and what the questions are, because there's nuances to this in terms of what the client wants after debt service and what we need to look at in order to meet those numbers.

8:11 - Charis Siau
  Yeah, I think I think it would be helpful to get clarity on like where the truest numbers live. And if I can share my screen, if you don't mind, I'll kind of show you what I'm seeing and what I'm not having clarity on on the numbers with like the minimum.

8:31 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Super helpful. Yeah, yeah, yeah. All right.

8:34 - Charis Siau
  I sent my request. Okay. You're good.

8:39 - Anke Jordaan
  All right.
  SCREEN SHARING: Charis started screen sharing - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/379999240?timestamp=524.339392

8:44 - Charis Siau
  Okay. Now, this is the client list on Slack. Do you see my screen?

8:54 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah. Cool.

8:55 - Charis Siau
  So, for instance, on Gil. Go. Go. we go. I see $200,000 here, and Jim Brennan, $500,000 a year after debt service minimum.  But then when I go to their buyer profile, the Aquamatch buyer profile, this is Gilles. It says minimum SDE after debt coverage, $170,000.  And for Jim's, it's not stated, I don't believe. I didn't see it. That shouldn't, that shouldn't be in Gilles.

9:32 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  I thought we removed that. So Anke, we need some standardization of what information that we're including.

9:38 - Anke Jordaan
  Okay, so we're not adding any minimum AC after debt service.

9:42 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  That's an internal, yeah, that's an internal measure.

9:47 - Charis Siau
  Okay. Also, Charis, we have some issues internally that we're trying to clean up with this new AI system of, like, when we get information from the clients, where is that updated across the board?  is So it was kind of a telephone game.

10:02 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  They might have told me in a client meeting, and then I tried to tell the team, and maybe we updated it on the internal profile, but it didn't get updated on the external.

10:11 - Charis Siau
  Yep, that makes sense.

10:15 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  You guys are now empowered to have ownership of this, like making sure that if you get that information, that you make sure it's updated across the board.  When we get this AI in place, which will be in the next month or two, then it's making sure that the AI gets that information, and then it will automatically update it in all the places that we're viewing this stuff from.  So that's coming, but in the meantime, feel free, all of you, to have ownership to look at in all of the places where metrics are appearing in the search, what the team is cleaning out, what I'm evaluating against, what's on the public profile.  Like make sure that it all is cohesive and makes sense. I think that would be a really good exercise, too, to just make sure we didn't miss  Anything? Because we probably did. And it was just a matter of bandwidth and team scrambling to keep everything updated.

11:09 - Charis Siau
  Luke had a lot of it in his head with how he was evaluating things.

11:12 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So did David. So we're cleaning that all up. So Gil increased the deal size that he wanted to look at.  So I believe that's where that 200K number came from.

11:26 - Luke Gillespie
  Is that right, Luke? No. So 170K was his old number, but because he's trying to use ROBS and so it would have to be a C-Corp, we kind of upped the technical minimum because of the taxes associated with a C-Corp for him to make the 170K he originally wanted.

11:42 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  It's going to be more like 200K with a C-Corp. Right. Okay. So then Charis, the quick deal calculator that you guys have, that's your best tool to put in like asking price and like SCE and that sort of thing.  And seeing if that amount left after loan payments is hitting the mark. When it's like a totally unreasonable, like if the multiple is a little bit high and you're like, there's probably some negotiation space there.  Obviously you can have a little cushion in terms of that because we can negotiate and make it. But if it's completely off the mark, like hundreds of thousands of dollars off, then if you're not sure if you should push it forward, you can bring it to this call.  But that's why we don't put like really a minimum eliminator on the sourcing. At least I don't think we do, Anke, with David.

12:43 - Anke Jordaan
  In terms of minimum, Athena, what do mean like minimum? Like the profit is too low?

12:51 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah.

12:54 - Anke Jordaan
  Yeah, he has a minimum that he looks for. I don't we prefer recalculating that.

12:59 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah. He uses this deal flow calculator when he's doing it. And what's his margin of error or what's his margin of difference or how is he determining if there's wiggle room in terms of negotiation?  I trained him the nuances of it.

13:14 - Luke Gillespie
  So he's not like, doesn't have a hard line. He knows if it's a little bit lower, the price can be negotiated.  He knows that.

13:22 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay. Let's get some like actual guardrails on that, especially because he's going to be training the AI to do that initially.  But yeah, for Charis and Cash's purpose, like that calculator is your best friend to basically like plug in the numbers on a deal that you're looking at and seeing if those numbers hit the mark in terms of their minimum after debt service number.

13:46 - Charis Siau
  Okay. Um, is there, are they supposed to be listed on the Aquamatch buyer profile here for like the minimum SDE?  Is that standard?

14:00 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  We were putting in what we thought, like, when we add in debt service, because brokers don't know how to calculate.  We're unique in the fact that we calculate after debt service. So that's why we put the deal sizes that we're targeting, because usually, like, you know, 2 million enterprise value will probably net around about that number.  There's not a perfect science to this, so there's, like, nuance all over the place. So as you guys are doing this, if you find ways to make more standardization or clean that up, like, we're open to it.  But that's, it's really the quick deal calculator is what we're doing, because, like, multiples can hugely vary, too, which can end up changing the debt service after, or the amount left after debt service.

14:55 - Charis Siau
  Okay. Okay. So that's, that, that ceiling is more, like, where are

15:00 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  And that's usually based on what they're like, we'll double whatever their pre-fall is. And that's how we get that number.  Okay.

15:10 - Charis Siau
  For Jim, and I asked this because, you know, reviewing the onboarding calls, I know Jim did mention 500, but then he also mentioned, you know, if it's like farther away or more semi-absentee where he doesn't have to spend like 40 plus hours in the business, then he'd be willing to go down quite a bit lower.  I think he dropped like either 200 or 300 K. So I'm trying to think where, you know, where we can house the variants in these minimums that we're looking for when we're doing these searches, because those should be in the end.

16:00 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Internal profiles. This is just a quick reference, right? Where would that be?

16:07 - Charis Siau
  Do I have access to those?

16:11 - Anke Jordaan
  I'll work through that with you, Chiara, so I think that information lives. And then with that, I'll work with the whole team, like you said, Athena, so we can just get all of the information updated on all the platforms of the client that the analyst owns.

16:26 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, because this spreadsheet is meant to be like a quick reference, more for all of us in Austin to see what kind of clients that we have.  Those internal profiles have a lot more information, and that's where the nuance should be captured. And as you guys are doing the onboarding sessions yourself, you're going to be signing off those profiles.  So because you guys are the ones now running the sessions for the new clients, I want you to like own that and be like, I need clarity.  Vodette. Vodette. mentality for Thank That's not right. That's not what they said. We haven't been able to do that in the past.  But now that you guys have that full cycle, like I'm having that conversation with them. like we talked about in the onboarding training, that's why it's so important to ask them the finance questions from like multiple different angles.  It's like, well, what's the minimum that you need to actually pay the bills, you know, versus what's your ideal.  And now I see a problem with Jim. He wants 500 after dad's service, but he only got pre-called for how much?  He's in that thing, like the pre-approved for 4.6. Okay. So that might be a little bit tight, potentially. Why are we targeting two to four million purchase price when he was approved for 4.6 though?  So this is where we need to, like, create some standardization here.

17:55 - Anke Jordaan
  Yeah, you're right. right.

18:03 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, it should be up to $5 million at least.

18:09 - Ryan Cash
  And maybe you can help me out. Maybe I misunderstood. There was something about going up to 2x over the SBA amount that we were approved for.
  ACTION ITEM: Document nuanced deal evaluation criteria used by you/David. Share w/ Anke
 - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/379999240?timestamp=1099.9999  Am I remembering that right? Am making that up? For the smaller ones, 2x.

18:22 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  For the larger ones, I think we were adding 2 million. Is that right, Luke?

18:29 - Luke Gillespie
  Yes.

18:30 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay, Luke, can you work with Anke to get everything out of your and David's head in terms of all this criteria and the nuance so that she has that and she can work with these guys to make sure the internal profiles and everybody's looking at it the same way?  That would be super helpful. Thank you. Yeah, sorry, guys. This went from, like, my head to Luke's head to David's head.  And we need to, it's just as we go through this, we're seeing where we need to extract information and just,  You know, kind of standardize it. So thank you. Keep flagging this stuff. I want you to like, feel like you know what you're looking for and you can just go off and look for it.  For the pre-qual, like if they're, you know, obviously if you're looking at bigger deals and what they're pre-qualified for, that can cause some issues with the broker.  So that's why we typically like kind of keep it within range of what they can look at. And then if there's like, I would go lowers for things that are closer to me than Charis, that's the nuance that you kind of need to evaluate deals as they come through.  It's a little bit hard for David to do that. So as long as you're making sure that whatever David's looking at, you know, he's not throttling or not pushing things through that you would have otherwise considered with those nuances.  And that's where you guys analysts are going to need to work with your front-end team to make sure that what's coming through to you matches what your expectations are in terms of these criteria.

19:57 - Charis Siau
  So does David? Did he use the internal documents that you've been mentioning? Is that kind of the house, the source?  Or does he use a different document?

20:14 - Anke Jordaan
  When he's searching, when he's filtering the deals, Charis, is that your question? He is basically looking at the industry list that you guys have.  And like Ian, Luke has their numbers in their heads in terms of where the wiggle room is for the asking prices and the ASTE he needs to look at.  But that's why we added that client list that you just took a look at. So he's looking at the industry list and he's looking at the client list.

20:38 - Charis Siau
  So he's looking at the Slack client list? Yes.

20:42 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay, so we have some issues there, Anke. Are you picking up on that? Yeah, there's different numbers in different places.  But also the numbers aren't reflective of, like there's a reason we have an internal profile. This Slack list was not meant to be the gospel here.  And or it needs to be made sure that it reflects what's in the internal profile. Because if he's cutting off things that are less than 500 in SDE, but Jim's open to it in his location, we have a problem.  Yeah, you're right. There's nuances connected to the numbers.

21:15 - Anke Jordaan
  It's not just one number and that's it.

21:17 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So Luke and David need to extract their nuance onto paper. And then we need to figure out a better way of communicating to the front end.  And these guys owning these numbers and understanding where these numbers came from and that we're setting numbers in a way that everybody's doing it.

21:36 - Anke Jordaan
  Yep. Cool.

21:39 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  All right. Good. Good stuff, Charis. Thanks for flagging this.

21:42 - Charis Siau
  For sure.

21:45 - Anke Jordaan
  Okay, Charis, the next thing on your agenda, just conscious of time with everything that Athena also has to go through, is you add a question on the lawyer's clients?
  SCREEN SHARING: Anke started screen sharing - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/379999240?timestamp=1307.710392
  SCREEN SHARING: Anke started screen sharing - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/379999240?timestamp=1307.710392

21:56 - Charis Siau
  Yeah, the question that I had with Jim and the... Kind of the minimum SDE. I'm pretty sure that was all tied to the discussion we just had.  So you're saying, Charis, it's too far for him to, like, it's outside of his geographical range where he would take less SDE?  Um, so it's in his secondary range. Um, and from what his profile says, if it's like up to a four hour drive, it's okay if it's semi-absentee.  So I need to figure out, okay, how much is the owner involved? Does it require his onsite presence? Um, can it be, you know, semi-remote?  Um, and if that's the case, I need to go back into the, the videos or seeing the internal documents to see what the other minimum was that he stated on the semi-absentee part.

22:56 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah. So what I, what I wanted to like. Just as a for everyone's knowledge, and Luke knows this, it's like we, Austin manages clients' expectations hard that even if it is something that could be remote in the future, like they're going to require onsite presence for the transition period.  And we don't take them on as clients if they have an idea that they're just going to be able to be a remote owner.  So just know that like we can push them and test them on this, especially in the calibration phase.

23:30 - Charis Siau
  Like, yeah, I never wanted to consider Dallas and then I found that business and I was like, I'll  move here.

23:35 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  don't care, you know, so we kind of want to go wide or first and just like manage, say like, hey, this is one of those calibration things.  It's super interesting, like if it is interesting, if it's a good business, if maybe in the future there's some remote or hybrid situation, then you could put it in front of them.  And or if it's just on the edge of geography, be like, it's just. It's on the edge of geography, but it's really interesting.  Great multiple, super interesting. I mean, he's a former engineer, right? Or no, Jim. No, Jim.

24:09 - Charis Siau
  Jim's been in the construction industry.

24:11 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Right. Okay. Um, anyways, like feel free to like put calibration deals in front of them. It doesn't need to be like a hundred percent direct hit.  You just need to explain like, Hey, this is one of those that's on the fringe, you know? So I want you to like, look into it.  Also, it's kind of semi off market. Um, sounds like, you know, came through our lawyers, which we love past QV, all those things.  Like that's a  red or huge green flags across the board. So, you know, might end up saving him a bunch of cash and there's real estate involved.  So looks like the multiple might be pretty low in that case. Exactly.

24:54 - Charis Siau
  Yeah.

24:55 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So I guess I just wanted to say for the benefit of the group that none of the clients. Or under the impression that they're going to be remote, passive, semi-passive to start.  So don't feel like you need to find even finer needles in the haystack like that. Just like thinking long-term view, like, is this something that could shift to that?

25:18 - Charis Siau
  And if you guys are ever not sure on an edge case, like, bring it here and we can talk about it.

25:22 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  But I'm always of the mind that I want more deals in front of them than less so that they're getting their reps in.  And, like, Cash just heard me schooling Peter on this earlier. Like, he got gatekept from an owner. I'm like, this is exactly why I need you, like, taking every rep you can, you know?

25:37 - Charis Siau
  And then he's like, okay, I get it.

25:39 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Athena's, like, going to put me in a bear cage and be like, you can't that was the best part of it.

25:45 - Ryan Cash
  He was like, I get it. Like, if the meeting is supposed to be in the middle of the woods with a bunch of angry animals, like, Athena's going to tell me to go make friends with the animals.

25:56 - Charis Siau
  I like Peter.

25:57 - Anke Jordaan
  He's always doing that. He's just like... When the light goes on, he's just so, I like Peter Long.

26:04 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, we just need to turn the light on for him, and he locks in, so yeah.

26:09 - Luke Gillespie
  That deal can work for JJ, depending on the location and owner's role as well. I noted that, Luke.

26:15 - Charis Siau
  Thanks for the note. I'll definitely keep that in mind. I will find out information, whether that's from a lawyer or the owner themselves, and then we'll kind of gauge, you know, who's best fit between your and my client.

26:28 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Love it. Cool. All right. Cash, did you want to talk through your call for Federico?

26:37 - Ryan Cash
  Yeah, do my best to keep this succinct. I just called a broker. I had four deals for Federico. Two of them were from the same broker, so I called the guy.  He has a deal in San Antonio that looks like it'd be a good fit. He said it. He said he does have wants a team wants wants wants that that he wants  Is into the acquisition, like there's another buyer who's looking at it right now. asked him if he had exclusivity on it, but he said, no, we didn't give them exclusivity at this stage.  Would that still be cool to put a write-up on this deal in front of Federico with the knowledge that this might not be on the market for too much longer?  Oh, when you say, okay, exclusive LOI.

27:34 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So we say under LOI, I was thinking the broker didn't have exclusivity. So that just helps me lock into where the conversation's at.  So you're saying there's another buyer that has put an LOI in place that the owner is going to sign?

27:53 - Ryan Cash
  I don't think so. like they're going to sign?

27:56 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  I don't think it is an LOI because I asked him if it was an exclusion.

28:00 - Ryan Cash
  Inclusive offer. he said that they were open to receiving secondary offers. So what you want to say to the broker then is like, is it under offer or is it under LOI?

28:15 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  That's the terminology just to do a teaching model for you there.

28:19 - Ryan Cash
  Yeah, no worries.

28:20 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Sorry. I'll rapid fire at it just because I, that's how I give feedback sometimes. So please don't take any, any offense, but yeah, I'll teach you the terms there.  So yeah, you can absolutely put it in front of them and you tell them like, Hey, there's already other offers on this.  You want to move fast. So this is why we're like always trying to get clients to like take the reps and also move really fast.  Like, and Federico's doing the modeling and doing the Sims. So that's cool, but just manages expectations. Like there is other offers on it.  Um, Luke does this all the time. So it's like the. The faster you move, the quicker, you know, you might have an opportunity to get your foot in the door.

29:06 - Ryan Cash
  Awesome. Cool.

29:07 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  When you're talking to a and that's the case, then I like to ask them just some questions about it.  Like, do you think the owner is going to like this offer? What kind of things would you need to see in the buyer or the offer to turn his head?  Like, what does my client need to do to get a foot in the door? Right. Yeah, there's definitely a lot that I could have done better on that.  That was my first time talking to a broker.

29:36 - Ryan Cash
  It was through a cold call, not through a scheduled meeting. So it was a little bit foot in mouth, but, you know, we got through it.  And he's also got another like HVAC deal in Corpus that might be on Federico's radar as well. But he won't have Sims until Monday.  So until now, I'm hoping to get this flooring deal in front of Federico by in the week. So we're looking.  Yeah.

30:02 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  And I know you're learning. That's why I'm giving you, I'm just giving you tips and feedback.

30:06 - Ryan Cash
  That's what these calls are for. Right.

30:08 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So you're going to continue drinking through a fire hose with these broker calls, but Luke's done hundreds of them now, way more than me.  And, you know, just, it helps if, if there's a competitive angle to it, like that's how we can get our clients an edge is like getting an inside scoop from the brokers before we put it in front of them.

30:29 - Ryan Cash
  So not that you did anything wrong. It's just like, here's, here's something in the future. If that comes up again for you to bear in mind.  Yeah. Super much better to have those words in my head now than, uh, wish I would have had them 20 minutes ago.  We're glad that I've got them now for sure. It's okay. You can always call back too.

30:48 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  You know, like, don't, don't feel like you can only have one call. You can always call back and be like, Hey, real quick.  Just want to make sure I'm not wasting my client's time. Like, what do you think? You know? So feel free to, if you called guys.  And he answered, you can always do that. And the burger calls are, it's going to take you a while to get into your rhythm and like know all the things that you need to ask them.  So just be patient with yourself and let us give you some tips and, you know, you'll get there. Like Luke had to do a bunch of them before he got there.  I had to do a bunch of them before I got there. It's just part of the process.

31:23 - Ryan Cash
  I've listened to him a lot of Luke doing it at like 2x speed. And I opened my mouth expecting what to come out to be what Luke was doing at 2x speed, but it did not come out that way.
  ACTION ITEM: Draft email for Athena to reach out to Stefan re: San Antonio deals for Cash
 - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/379999240?timestamp=1898.9999  But, you know, definitely, I don't know. It's like everything else, right? Just going to have to do a bunch of them and get better at it.

31:47 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Absolutely. Anke, while I'm thinking about it, we should have, maybe we should have a reach out to Stefan.

32:00 - Anke Jordaan
  Um, from Lindsey Steele.

32:03 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah. Cause he's in San Antonio and maybe I could reach out and like say, Hey, we've got a client in San Antonio, obviously like had a successful close with you.  wondering if you have anything else on your radar that might be interesting for our clients. I'd love to introduce you to my team if so.  And then we can just give, uh, Cash that broker relationship.

32:24 - Anke Jordaan
  Sure. I'll draft that up for you.

32:27 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Sweet.

32:30 - Anke Jordaan
  Um, all right, Athena, it's your turn. Was that, was that everything Cash?

32:34 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  You said you had another call or something else you wanted to go through?

32:38 - Ryan Cash
  Nope. That's it for me. Okay, good.

32:41 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Um, this is not to solve on this call, but it's something that, uh, we need to think about is the client geography overlap, both the sensitivity around it and actually understanding where the overlap is between these guys.  So they understand where they might. Have overlapping markets, like Pittsburgh is Jim's market, right, Charis?

33:06 - Charis Siau
  Yes.

33:08 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So like Luke's looking at deals in Pittsburgh, for example. So I want maybe an exercise where you guys deeply go through the maps, all of your clients' geographies, and understand where the overlap is between different clients and those markets.  Because we're going to have more clients coming on, and they might have multiple markets. So what, and when you have that overlap, seeing if there's industry overlaps, kind of the way that I'm viewing it is the first person to sign on with us as a client.  Like if there's a situation where it could go one of two clients, and the person that's been with us the longest should get priority.  Um, yeah, and, you know. Like a discussion amongst you guys of like, okay, well, who might be best for this?  You know, so it's like, you know, who's been with us the longest, but then does it make sense for one client over the other based on their interests, their background, et cetera, et cetera.
  ACTION ITEM: Organize team exercise to map client geography overlaps. Find system to manage
 - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/379999240?timestamp=2054.9999  I don't know what the answer is here, but it's going to come up a lot. So like, I want us to figure out how to, how to do that.  So Anke, I feel like the first instance is like you guys as a foursome going through the map together and seeing where those, those potential overlap areas might be.

34:38 - Charis Siau
  And then, I mean, can we do like a secondary pass? Let's say if the first go around the client passes on the deal or it ends up falling out, we can do that to our secondary client?

34:51 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Absolutely. So, and we should ideally, right? Like get them to make a quick answer on it. And like, if it's not a good.  Fit for one, just be like, Hey, there's another client that's my work for. Can I get an official pass from you?  Like, so giving, just giving them the option and just saying, like, are you officially passed? You know, I'd like to introduce this to another client.  If it's not for you, are you officially passing on it? That might change their mind around it. Right. Yeah.

35:18 - Charis Siau
  You're all good.

35:19 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Um, so perfect.

35:23 - Charis Siau
  Awesome.

35:23 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  And then for things like, um, um, like Luke, for instance, for Morgan, who's interested in Austin, Justin gets first priority in Austin on everything, unless there's an industry that Justin said he's not interested in that Morgan is.  Is that your understanding of it? Yeah. Well, I just like, how were you thinking about that? Or had I, had that been communicated?  To you because Austin's communicating things to clients about the location.

35:59 - Luke Gillespie
  So. I just want to make sure it's coming through. Yeah, you had already told me about that. Morgan's deals are smaller than Justin's, so there shouldn't be too much overlap there.  But yeah, you already told me that, so that's how I'm operating.

36:12 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay, and if there's an overlap situation, like, this is also a great place to bring them, so we can all discuss it and just make a call on what we do.  But first, you guys need to understand where those overlaps might be. So let's get that as an action point, Anke, see if you can find some system to it, and then we'll just have to navigate it as it happens.

36:34 - Anke Jordaan
  Yep. Something like Florida.

36:38 - Ryan Cash
  Also, might just need a whole Florida SOP for, like, the five clients that have overlapping areas in Florida.
  ACTION ITEM: Lead deal box discovery call w/ Pushkar tomorrow. Prep by watching Luke's video
 - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/379999240?timestamp=2204.9999

36:48 - Anke Jordaan
  Okay.
  ACTION ITEM: Watch Luke's previous call w/ Josh re: digging into industries before tomorrow's call
 - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/379999240?timestamp=2217.9999

36:55 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Cash, I was going to ask your, like, comfort level in leading the call tomorrow. or would you like me to do it?

37:02 - Ryan Cash
  Yeah, the deal box discovery call. Yeah, totally. Okay, did you get a chance to watch Luke's one that he did with Josh where he was like digging into the industries?  No, I haven't. If there's a way that if anyone knows where that's located, if they can tag me on that again, on the wherever it's posted, would love to dive in and watch that ahead of tomorrow.

37:28 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay, would you, are you gonna have time to do it? know there's, there's still a lot of training going on this week.

37:34 - Ryan Cash
  Yeah, I can do that.

37:36 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay, I didn't want to throw you into it. So I just wanted to check, like, I think it'd be better.  You know, if you're comfortable, you lead it, I can jump in and dig into places if need be, but better for me to, you know, have you guys lead it, I can see if there's anything I need to clean up and then you guys are off to the races on the future being able to run them.

37:55 - Ryan Cash
  No, especially with Pushkar, like his question, he's, he's pretty open, like on his questionnaire. Oh, yeah.

38:01 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  And it's Pushkar. He's fun. He's great. So, yeah, that should be an easy one.

38:04 - Ryan Cash
  It'll be a pretty lightweight rep to get started with. So I'm cool with it. Okay.

38:11 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Awesome. Great. I'm excited you're up for that. Cool. So, Luke, I hope you don't mind. would love to use a teaching moment on our communication theme on this message that you sent to the channel earlier.  Are you open to that? Okay, cool. Can you open it up, Anke, so we can read the message? Or, yeah, there we go.  Okay, cool. So with communication as our, like, theme of the month and also, like, making sure that we're not interrupting people's workflows through our communication.  Luke, I'd love to hear your thoughts on maybe how this could have been a little bit more directive or collaborative.

39:03 - Anke Jordaan
  Yeah, I should have been more specific.

39:06 - Luke Gillespie
  And first of all, yeah, this is a message that I sent when all the clients were on my plate and I didn't know Charis and Cash were going to do brokerals.  That's why I was asking for Ray to be able to do that. So it's kind of irrelevant now. Anke and I talked about that.  But yeah, I guess I should have directed it toward Anke specifically because I was kind of asking permission for Anke about the operations here.  Yeah, great.

39:29 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So using at channel notifies like everyone in the channel. But if it's a specific team member that we need, you know, we want to do things in the Slack channel.  So we all have kind of visibility of what's going on. But if it's a specific team member that we need feedback on, then adding that person.  And if you're ever not sure, Anke will tell you like who needs to be brought into it. But like, there's two things here.  One is let's like, you know, if we don't need to notify the whole channel. Or ask the whole channel.  Remember the thing that I say, if everybody does something, what happens?

40:08 - Luke Gillespie
  Nobody does it. Exactly.

40:10 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah. So it also helps you too to get what you need. So if you add channel, then everybody's going to sit there and be like, I don't know who needs to respond.  So you're going to get a better response to if you tag the person there. And then also if I want to get us out of the mindset of clients have a write-up, we don't need to do that, right?  So now that we have multiple resources, we want the deal flow to come through as it comes through. We don't have clients that are loving the write-ups in front of them right now.  So if they're not like, I will stay up all night to do whatever it takes to get this deal, we don't stop the deal flow.  And that's, that's for everybody, right? If you're in a situation where you're. You're not sure what to do around deal flow.  Use those daily meetings with Anke to be like, hey, I'm a little concerned that I don't have any space for this client.  So rather than stopping the scheduling of meetings, like maybe creating some space to make sure that you have openness for the clients that haven't had write-ups could be an alternative to this too.  But no more, there's no minimum write-ups, right? We're not throttling deal flow. We're not getting back into that situation where we're running around.  Like this is the priority client this week. Like we want throughput. If you're in a situation where I'm not sure that, you know, like I think something might be preventing me from being able to service another client.  That's exactly the things to raise in your daily deal team meetings, or if it's more urgent, like tag Anke, see if she can help make a decision before we tell a team member to stop their workflow.  Thanks, Luke. Appreciate you letting me use you. As an example, but like I said, the communication thing, as we're growing and we're getting all these new systems in place, it's going to get even more important that we're, you know, clear and directive, so.

42:14 - Anke Jordaan
  Again, you've got a hard spot in 10 minutes, so do you want to prioritize these or do you want to sprint through them?

42:22 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, cool. Luke, what were your learnings from running your client meeting last night? We talked about some things, but I thought it was a good opportunity to just help, help Luke, help Charis and Cash kind of take some learnings from what you learned.

42:39 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah, something that Athena taught me is one, always start the meeting off with at least five minutes or so of small talk, kind of lighten the mood there and to build the rapport and then make everyone feel comfortable in the call.  And then also, if your client is like low energy, they're kind of demotivated or depressed because they just lost a deal like last night, don't match.  their energy with low energy, like opposite them with high energy to get them out of that low energy, which is something that we had go on yesterday.  And then also, like, don't try to do the talking for them. Let them talk. Just ask them short questions.  Like instead of having a long, detailed question, oh, how did you feel about that? Did it make you feel like this?  Just say, oh, how did you feel? Like just ask short, concise questions and let them talk and make it like a therapy session where they get to get their voice out.

43:31 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Good. Good stuff, Luke. And to build on that, Luke and I talked about, like, what's the outcome of the learning that we want this client to have?  Cash and I talked about that with PJ, right? So before you go into your client calls, you want to think about, like, what's the outcome that I want from this client?  And rather than telling them the answer, we kind of want to, like, guide them there with directive questioning. so something that I learned about God, like when I was doing.  Statistics in college was like leading questions, right? Like when you're doing surveys and you're doing like official studies and that sort of thing, you have to be really careful of like putting bias in there.  So as you're learning how to ask questions, usually shorter questions are better. So then you don't end up like leading the client down a path, right?  And maybe they didn't feel that way or whatever. If they're struggling, then you can ask more questions. But if you're thinking about like, what's the outcome that I want, what we wanted from Dustin and Lindsay, they lost a deal because they just took so much time to take action.  And it was actually a deal they were really excited about. They got an LOI together. They talked to the lawyers, they did financial modeling, like they were ready to go on it.  And they just sat on the follow-up, you know, even though we told them not to. So they were pretty despondent about it because they knew that it was like their fault, but that the learning that we.  Wanted them to arrive at was like, they need to move quicker. And rather than being like, you guys need to move quicker, which is like making them feel like they did something wrong.  It's like, Hey, so what were your learnings from this one? You guys are really excited about it. What are you taking away from this?  And, and what are you going to do next time? You know, rather than, so do you think you need to go quicker next time?  You see the difference in how you asked that question? Cause it's almost like insinuating they did something wrong there.  So this is a skillset that I have developed over  what? 25 years of client servicing. I'm not expecting you guys to nail it, but I just want to also use these opportunities to help give you some tools and just thoughts on, on how to get the most out of your clients.  The rapport building, it's probably really boring for you guys to listen to when you're sitting in the client meetings, but it's so, so, so important because like it builds the trust.  It builds the, like, they know that you're in their corner, that you get them and that you care. And it also lightens the mood when you have some of  Tougher  to talk about. So yeah, Luke's like, I just want to get down to business. Like, let's go through this.  And like, it's good sometimes, but like when they have a loss, you kind of need to lighten the mood a little bit.  Also, it helps you get to know them because you're essentially looking at like things that are going to change their life.  So if you understand their life a little bit better or how, like what they do outside of work or this or whatever, it actually helps you get their head a little bit more.  So good stuff, good learnings, Luke. You're doing really great on the client calls too. Okay. The Valuation Buyers Club, this is really important for all of you.  So I'd like you to all be camera on and paying attention. There's going to be a lot of good stuff in there that you guys can take away into your analysis.  Luke, you said Morgan's write-up was ready on Monday. haven't seen it yet. What's happening there?

47:00 - Luke Gillespie
  I just sent it in the channel. It's done. Okay.

47:04 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  What happened between saying it was ready and it being Thursday? Sorry.

47:08 - Luke Gillespie
  I didn't mean that. I never said it was ready. I said I have a write-up to do for Morgan is what I meant.

47:13 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  I was just trying to understand the next steps for who was going to do the call in the NDA.

47:17 - Luke Gillespie
  Sorry. I didn't communicate that properly. I should have been more clear.

47:20 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  But yeah, it's done now. Okay, good. I will get a review of that today then. Awesome. I'm excited. Client responses.  Oh, so Cash. I love proactivity and jumping in and wanting to help the clients. Just some things to clean up on the Federico thing that happened.  And if you don't know the answer, chances are someone on the team does. So you can always send a hold message like, hey, Federico, let me talk with the team and get back to you.  Rather than, I'm not sure. I don't know. Also, you guys, we've spent thousands and thousands of dollars and hundreds of hours maybe on getting resources.  is together for clients. So rather than saying that it looks like there's an issue with a template that they're making multimillion dollar decisions on, please flag it with us internally before saying something like that with the client.  We've spent a lot of time and money on that template. And if we shake their confidence that it doesn't work, they'll never trust it.  So if you're not sure, please flag it in an internal channel before saying something to the client, like something's wrong with one of our resources.  If it genuinely is something wrong, we want to know about it too, so we can fix it because it is a document that they're making multimillion dollar decisions with.  Yeah, totally heard.

48:42 - Ryan Cash
  Yeah, definitely. I get it. I was definitely shocked that I was the one who was called on to do that, that early.  But yeah, totally get bringing it up to the team. All right.

49:00 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Sorry, so I might have missed some steps there. So did someone call on you to answer the question?

49:05 - Ryan Cash
  Yes. Okay, who called on?

49:09 - Anke Jordaan
  Ida posted the question in the Deal Team channel and she said, is this an Athena question or is this something Cash can answer because it's Cash's client?  And then I responded and says, Cash can take a stab at it, but I think Luke will have a much more clearer response since Cash is very new to this financial modeling template.  And that's when Luke gave Cash the video on what Luke's analysis was on Federico's problem. Okay, so was that a hard coding comment?

49:39 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Was that client facing or was that internal? Because I might have misunderstood.

49:43 - Ryan Cash
  I thought it was a comment made to the client. That was client facing. That was before I had seen Luke's video on that.  Okay, cool.

49:55 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  If you're not sure how to answer it, like lean on the team and be like, hey guys, I'm not really sure.  Sure how to answer this. Like, please, can you help? Have Anke help, have Luke help. Don't feel like you need to go and like, it wasn't, it sounds like it wasn't necessarily a call.  Like you have to do this. It's like, Hey, are you comfortable doing this? Or does Athena need to do it and feed in?  So if you're not sure, lean on the team. We're here to help. Like I said, we don't expect you to know.  There's so many things going on. We don't expect you to know all the answers. Chances are someone on the team does.  But before we go client facing and say, we don't know, or there might be a problem with one of our templates.  Like, let's try to get it answered. Or if you think there's a problem, flag it with Anke and she can look into it too.

50:38 - Ryan Cash
  Yeah, totally heard. Makes a lot of sense. Awesome.

50:44 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Thank you. And I appreciate the, you know, proactivity and wanting to get it done too. So there's, there's nuances to this and we got him a great answer in the end.

  Yeah, I think I can do that in a quick Loom video for them, get them all the details. Okay, great.

51:24 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay, I think that's it. Anke, you're going to follow up with them on the template.

51:28 - Anke Jordaan
  Great. That's it. That's it. Just the template. I'll follow up with you guys. Just final updates before I get it in circulation.  So I just want to make sure it's done. Everybody's happy with the template. Okay, amazing.

51:41 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Cool. Thanks, guys. Really good stuff. I'm excited to see all the movement.

51:48 - Charis Siau
  Okay, sounds good. That's cool. Yeah, see you in a few minutes. This will be a fun one. Enjoy it.  Bye.
