  Hello. Oh, good.

0:07 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  can hear you. I was worried that I need to do something happening with my computer, but the like sound driver isn't working for some reason.

0:15 - Luke Gillespie
  So let's see. How do I think your microphone was being a little bit goofy kind of volume going in and out in that call as well, but be sure it's not my voice.  Oh, I don't know. But Mike is awesome. That was great.

0:31 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  I'm like, seriously, our most risk-averse clients are on the call.

0:35 - Luke Gillespie
  I know.

0:36 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  God, what is Gil going to do after this?

0:39 - Luke Gillespie
  I think that's what our clients need to see.

0:45 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  It's tenacity, right? you're just gonna have to do it. So like, oh, God, Polly and Gil just listen to Mike.

0:54 - Luke Gillespie
  is it gonna inspire them or is it gonna terrify? I'm like, what's gonna happen?

1:00 - AcquiMatch Team
  If there was a way to say all that, though, it's in his tone and being funny, right? there's a way to talk about the bad stuff, but he did a good job of doing it.

1:12 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, he's great, isn't he?

1:14 - Luke Gillespie
  is great. And his son was like the cutest  thing when he's talking about selling this, he's like taking off his glasses and .

1:22 - Anke Badenhorst
  What's this?

1:23 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Like multi-tasking of a small child, too business owner.

1:32 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah, well, I've been meaning to ask him, I was going to reach out to him, ask him to buy him a cup of coffee or something.  We've been texting a little bit here and there, but is the towing company in Florida, or is it because how is he living in Irvine?

1:48 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  I think both companies are actually in Florida.

1:51 - Luke Gillespie
  That's a good question, though. Yeah, I don't want to like boost him on the call, but obviously how are you living in Irvine and running the company in Florida as well?

1:59 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  He moves, he moves her. fine because he wanted to like start acquiring there, but like he wants his son to like grow up near family and on the coast and stuff.  So yeah, I believe the towing company is also here.

2:15 - Luke Gillespie
  Oh, okay.

2:16 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  That's a good question. Yeah, that was fun. It's so fun. Um, it's good to hear like the real perspectives too, you know, it's just like the personality type or you know, the overcoming the resistance to difficult conversations is so important to like tease out and just get them playing like avoiding it before you get into the business is gonna like set you up even worse after because you're gonna have to have it those conversations no matter what, you know, like.  So yeah, it was good. Um, cool. So wanted to check in. I apologize. I was like completely shut down.  Um, earlier this week. So thank you all for doing amazing jobs and didn't even seem like I needed to be around.  It looks like everything was going well and clients were making offers and getting deals. thank you for looking after things Ryan.  Thank you for jumping in on Tuesday too. I heard it went really well. Anka jumping and rearranging everything and appreciate all that.  So what I'd love to do today is just real quick talk about the recordings thing and make sure we're covered off there and all on the same page.  And then I'd love to just get a status update on where we're at with everything. We got a week left in the month.  So how are we looking? Is there any critical things we should know about?

3:39 - Luke Gillespie
  then in just a general update. Does that sound good for today? Yeah. Cool.

3:45 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay. So on the recordings and the way we're communicating to clients like how to talk about it and that sort of thing.  Like where did we land with that? How have we been communicating it if at all?

4:00 - AcquiMatch Team
  And What are we going to do going forward? So the plan was to on the writeups put underneath the recordings, a kind of brief text that kind of explains the situation.  So it's a reminder each time they listen to the recording. So I was able to put something together that I thought looked pretty good.

4:25 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  OK, my screen right now. Well, so just just to update. So at this point, we've not had a conversation with clients as part of the onboarding process or anything about how, if at all, they're to refer to those, is that correct?

4:43 - AcquiMatch Team
  No, that's not been in part of the onboarding process.

4:46 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  OK, so we're pretty lucky that it hasn't become a problem up at this point. So the reason why it flagged was because it was like, I'll tell someone so that I've listened to all the calls and I was like, whoa, whoa, no, don't do that, right?  So. And that might have been a my bad in the handing over, like not part of the training process or whatever.  So, you know, I think. It's one of those great area things where it hasn't been a problem. I want to make sure it doesn't become a problem and it's something that we just want to stay ahead of both, but just making clients and like, Hey, we're, you know, we know you'll be discretionary.  We're giving you the recording. So you can have the context. But it's really important that you don't make them feel like big brother was listening in and you just say we've discussed the calls and you've gotten notes from us is is how I would do it in the past, right, rather than saying we've been listening calls kind of haven't been doing that either.

6:00 - Luke Gillespie
  No, but I started now since this topic got brought up. say, can I, is it okay if I recorded this call for no taking purposes and they're generally always cool with it.

6:12 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah. Okay. Yeah, cool. Um, so then we just need to like, I think as part of the onboarding process, the GONCA, this needs to start with you, it needs to be said and said again, because once won't be enough, like, hey, you know, we provide the recording so you can have context and color.  But it's really important. You don't make them feel like you've been listened in on, know, we tell them report the calls for no taking purposes to just say, we've caught up about the calls and you've been informed on the notes from the calls is what I'm thinking is the positioning is that where you guys were kind of going with it.

6:46 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah, and I've been mentioning them in my room video walkers as well. And now we added in Ryan and uncle came over this idea.  There's like a disclaimer and on every write up format. Now I just wrote a little disclaimer about it. I can read it off.  Yeah, what does it say? It says, note, we record our calls with the broker slash seller for you to listen to because we want to provide the best experience for you, our client.  We do ask for and receive consent from the broker before recording the call. However, it would be best that you don't mention to the broker and or seller that you have listened to the call recording, rather just say Luke slash Ryan has told me dot dot dot dot.

7:26 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Then it kind of seems like I don't know if I love this disclaimer on the right up because then it makes it sound like we're doing something shady, you know?

7:35 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah, okay. How would you like? I think it needs to be a discussion. Okay.

7:41 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  It needs to be part of the on-boarding process when onka talks about the process, right? then when Ryan does the first call with them on the write-ups, it's like, hey, you're going to get a write-up, there's going to be recordings of the calls.  will keep providing these as long as you're being discretionary because we think it would be better for you to have the context rather than just the notes.  But it's important for you to say like, hey, I got the notes and caught up with Ryan about the call So like that because then it seems like I don't want them to feel like they're doing anything wrong And when you disclaimer like that makes them feel might make them feel like they're doing something shady Or and maybe this is a wider conversation that we all need to think about.  Do we stop providing recordings?

8:30 - Luke Gillespie
  We just provide notes to the calls I think I think that would be a mess. think a huge value of what we provide to clients is the broker calls So I think that would be a bad idea, but maybe  How do you feel, Ryan?

9:14 - AcquiMatch Team
  You know, I think we can tell the clients, know, if he knows you're suggesting in the onboarding process or what not, say, hey, know, this is kind of how it's going to go.  I don't think that the reason why I do like a little thing underneath it is because they will forget I had this conversation with Joe at the very beginning.  He, one of the very first things we did, he was like, should I tell them that I had the calls recording?  And I said, I did tell them, but probably best to just say, I've reviewed, you know, the notes along those lines, just so it doesn't seem like, even if I ask them.  to record. If I could record it, I didn't ask them, can I show this for everyone? I know, right?  So, and I used to go to the idea, that makes sense. And then he repeated, like, I don't want, I don't want to be like, feeling like I'm hiding something, right?  So, I think as anyways, I thought about this and I keep coming back to as long as on the calls, we say, we're going to be recording this.  And they get their permission. If it does come up, even though if we slightly coach them not to, if it does come up, we have established that we inform that we're recording the calls.  So, I do like them listening to the calls. I think listening to the tone of voice of the broker and how they're talking, out, get, opens them to a whole new level of what this business is, especially with the off-market calls.  So I do like the actual warnings. I think that's a lot of value in terms of not including them, you know, maybe if this became a problem, we could be like, okay, we need to shut this down.  But I think right now it hasn't. And if we're kind of trying identify now that it could be a problem and just putting things in place to make sure it doesn't happen, I'd say let's start there.  And then if it does become problem, we could revisit that.

11:27 - Anke Badenhorst
  Yeah, I want to note that I think the fact that it hasn't become a problem is by the time our clients listen to the recordings, they have also signed the NDA.  And the broker is aware that they've signed the NDA. So if they've signed the NDA, there's nothing that the broker said on the call to Ryan or Luke that they wouldn't have said to the client if they had the conversation with them as well.  maybe that's the reason that it hasn't become problem is because we signed the NDA, the client signed the NDA.

11:56 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So the information is shareable. I can't imagine brokers. would like be cool with that, to be honest. I think nobody has just stepped in it yet.

12:06 - AcquiMatch Team
  Yeah, I think the NDA is a different scenario than just privacy of conversation, right? It's like the NDA is just like the information about the business, the sharing of the recording is more so it's like I had a conversation with you in confidence and you shared that with someone else and I was without me consenting to that.

12:38 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So, you know, y'all know how big I am on integrity and that sort of thing. So, I think disclosing that we're recording it for note-taking purposes is great.  Luckily, the HubSpot number already informs them of that before they pick up the call. So, like, reiterating it, like, hey, I'm recording this for note-taking purposes.  And then, They don't consent, then you need to stop recording and make sure you're taking notes, okay? Because that's where we could really get into the  is if they say no, and then we're recording anyway.  Then I think it is more a conversation on tactic and strategy and relationship building as part of the onboarding process.  Ryan, with your first and second calls and strategy and stuff, just like a reminder, hey, you know, we provide the recording so you can get color on it.  But we recommend that you say you listen to the notes just to make sure that the relationship goes smoothly.  These guys talk to a bunch of different people. They might not remember whatever, right? So, but if it starts feeling like it's out of hand or we're not getting a handle on it with clients, like the fact that Gil thought that was a good idea.  It's like, you know, sometimes we can't get ahead of them. so that's why early and often that we should be like making sure we're re  iterating, like best practices for you to say you've discussed our conversations with us, right?

14:07 - AcquiMatch Team
  So to clarify on Gil, he did ask me, can I tell him that I listened to the calls? I said, yes, because I actually prepped that seller for that.  So that seller, I said, I'm going to record the calls and share these. Okay, he confirmed. So in that situation, I actually had already told him he can, because I told the seller he'll be listening.

14:35 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay, great. So, but like I saw that and I was like, oh , I dropped the ball here somewhere.  It wasn't like informing them really on. So that's where panic stations came from, from my perspective, because when I was running, you know, the deals and that sort of thing, I had those conversations with all the clients and not everything gets passed over, but it's like, it's the thing that could be a problem for us.  So Making sure we're ahead of it before it does become a problem is why we want to have these conversations and things think about it The disclaimer the way you've written it almost makes it feel like they're doing something naughty to me so it might be worth maybe having like conversations first and then like seeing if we actually need a disclaimer in it because if we hit it too hard, right and like over emphasizes out of nowhere then they're gonna be like it's something wrong.  Am I doing something wrong? Am I right? Am I being like complicit in some weird thing? you understand because we haven't if we haven't said anything any of them before apart from like Joe Then for all of a sudden it should just show up as a disclaimer and blah blah blah they might be like is something wrong?  Am I lying to them?

15:46 - Luke Gillespie
  So we don't want to do that either Yeah, I get that and I guess the fact that it hasn't come up for this long shows that it maybe wasn't that much of a problem I thought it would be self-explanatory for our clients not to mention that the cause being recorded  So, but I guess the trade off for us now is decided on the our client experience on getting to listen to that broker call, or being fully integrous with that broker.  And because I'm sure if you broke some brokers, the really nice ones will probably be okay with it. I'll say, Hey, we try to try to provide the best experience for our clients.  Um, so I do record these calls and show them to my client.

16:24 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  And I'm sure a lot of some of the brokers, I would say that right off the bat with the experience or having or learning how to get through the gatekeepers.

16:31 - Luke Gillespie
  Like they'll definitely shut down. Exactly.

16:33 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Like it's not.

16:34 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah. Only the really nice one. going to allow it. I rather have you get through the gatekeeper and not record the call.  You know what I'm saying? Cause that's what I'm saying.

16:43 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah.

16:44 - Luke Gillespie
  going to turn off brokers to us.

16:46 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  They're going to, yeah. But recording it for no taking purpose is, is accurate, right? we're, we're disclosing or recording it for no taking purposes and taking notes.  Um, so let's keep a real close eye on this and then Akka and Ryan and white. you to like come up with like the right comms and like you know I think it's a verbal thing as part of the onboarding process and don't make it a thing just be like hey we record the calls so you can like listen in and get the nuance but it's really important that you just say that you caught up with us and got the notes when you when you catch up with them right so they don't feel like big brother and everybody's listening even though they consent to recording so this is a recommendation when you talk to them is that you caught up with us and you've been filled in our discussion so far.  What do you think?

17:41 - AcquiMatch Team
  Yeah I've been doing more or less that with Chris, JJ, I've told them I'm like look calls are recording you can access them here probably just best of not bring it up on the call and you can always just reference that view but you  I think I always say, I always say, Ryan brought me up to speed, that's what I always say.

18:09 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  To tell them.

18:10 - AcquiMatch Team
  you're going to reference a call or you saw it here, just say, Ryan informed me and you can always put it on me.
  ACTION ITEM: Develop script w/ Ryan for broker consent to share call recordings w/ clients - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/218640014?timestamp=1106.9999  came for me. don't need to see where they're from. So I've been doing that. Cool. I mean, we can also potentially just get the permissions from the brokers at the end of the call.
  ACTION ITEM: Develop script w/ Luke for broker consent to share call recordings w/ clients - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/218640014?timestamp=1106.9999  If it's cool that goes well and you're playing to do it right up Luke and you're like, you know, going to let them listen to the call, you can end.  Like for me, as soon as like, at the end of the broker call, when I know they're excited about, we're going to introduce a deal to a buyer, then I lay out everything I want because  I have them right yeah so like so I'll be like hey like remember like you said that some of you're you're telling them to send the emails to the NDAs to the clients set after the call so when I have them I don't let them go right there I just go I don't know I'll give you the email now and I'll just wait until you send it that way as soon as I get off the call I know it's set right because I soon you have them just get them to do what you want right then and there yeah so another way you could you could use that is that if you if they're if the conversation's going well it's a good right up you're excited you they're excited then you can just right there at the end just be like okay I'm gonna get with them I do this little write-up form so they can review everything so care if I share the calls with them get that last confirmation in terms of sharing you know and then then you're really good right so that's another option I love that idea and maybe sell it to them as to why it's to their benefit right like hey

20:00 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So I reported the call for my own note-taking purposes. I can share the notes, but what we've seen have better impact, so they're not wasting your time and they're fully caught up to see this, to be able to listen to this, are you okay with that, right?  Get consent at the end. And we can try all that and see if we're able to do it. Because something, when Ryan took over, I was like sending write-up stipives before getting him to sign the NDAs.  And Ryan's like, no, I think we should get them to sign the NDAs for some other way. don't know if that's gonna work.  And it's great. And it's an entire way of doing it. We're maintaining all the broker relationships is scalable that way.  So getting consent at the end for whether we can share it or not. And then some write-ups just aren't gonna have the recordings because the brokers didn't consent to it.  That feels better to me, right? kind of just say you listen to the notes. So if we saw the broker on the reasons why, we're like, the deals that get done quicker and better are the ones where they're able to kind of work.  Listen in on the conversation and fully catch up. Are you okay with me sharing our conversation with them?

21:05 - Luke Gillespie
  What do y'all Uh, I mean, I love that idea in theory.

21:13 - AcquiMatch Team
  I just think in reality lot of brokers Probably won't like it, but if if that's our strategy, I I can do it But if they say no, then it's good too because then we just know for that client we can't share the call and then we just do the Right.

21:27 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  It's just about getting Clarity at the app And then we're doing the right thing because like if the broker finds out that we shared the recording Sometimes during the deal and then they blow up the deal because we didn't disclose it or didn't get you know what I mean like I just At at scale It makes me uncomfortable a little bit to be doing this and and I don't like feeling uncomfortable and not would translate to the clients Do so I kind of like this idea better of like at the end if the call goes well And they're fired up get consent.  Um, and And then some write-ups are just not going to have the recordings, and, know, we'll see how much it impacts being able to get a deal done.  And if it doesn't work, we can just change the process again, brother. I mean, we speak to so many brokers and stuff.  That's one thing. Right. But I like the end of call. You got them bought in. It was a good conversation.  Yeah, So maybe Ryan and Luke, you guys can, like, mock some, do some mock calls together, do some practice, get some scripting together for how that might go.

22:41 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah. Yeah. All right. We can do this. I'll do like, I think that's good. you said, try to sell them on and be like, Hey, I'm really trying to give my client the best experience.

22:50 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  And like I said, no, no, no, no, no, That's not to their benefit.

22:53 - Luke Gillespie
  Okay.

22:55 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  You're trying to help them get a deal done. So like you want to sell them on why it's to their benefit.

23:02 - Luke Gillespie
  Okay.

23:03 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Not like I'm trying to give my client the best experience, but I don't give a . Right? But like, if you're like, Hey, so in our experience, like the deals that have like the, you know, that get done quicker and better or when when our clients can like hear our conversation, are you okay with me sharing that with them?  You know, like I'll it to them as to why it's to their benefit and why it will help them get a deal done better.  And then they might get bought in because if you if you saw if you like, I'm just doing my job or, um, you know, like giving my client a good experience and they're like, I don't know who you are.  don't give a  like you always want to sell people on what it's to their benefit not yours.

23:49 - Luke Gillespie
  That's a good point. Yeah. All right. Yeah. And I'll trial it with a more expendable deal flow like Chris or something.  I can't risk talking up a rare Andrew Oklahoma.

24:01 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  I'd say start, start, start doing it when you feel confident and you've had a good call. Like when you're like, that call went really well.  Now I'm feeling good. I'm confident. me try it, right? And you'll build up your, your kind of like confidence around it, but work with Ryan on it because he's so good with the broker calls and like how to, how to place that and how to have those conversations.

24:23 - Luke Gillespie
  I think you can script a few things together. So you can just read it off at the end when you're feeling good.  Yep. Yeah, we can talk.

24:31 - AcquiMatch Team
  I actually, I've been thinking this as you got been talking. I already have a script in my head that we can do it.  Yeah.

24:37 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Good. I like this. I feel a lot better about this. I think we should try to let it see if it works.  And, and then maybe this is something we roll out like we did with the NBA.

24:45 - Luke Gillespie
  But we're just operating from a place of integrity across the board. That's really what we want to do. Sounds good.

24:52 - AcquiMatch Team
  Yep.

24:53 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  And it's something that's been on my mind and bothering me since we started. So like it's getting big enough now that we have to start being  a bit more above board on this stuff because people are noticing, right? the thing today, like it was 60 people in there listening to, you know, about what we're doing and lots of lenders and lawyers and everything in the room.  So we want to be above board about everything where we can. So at certain points, you know, we bootstrap things and we do things because it gets us by.  And then as we grow and get bigger, we have to look at these things through a different lens than whenever we got started.  So thank you for indulging not all of that. So I want to try to end on time because I got to get back up to this happy hour thing.

25:41 - AcquiMatch Team
  I also want to say I have a call at the top of hour with Jason about his deal.

25:46 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Exciting. Okay, cool. So let's start with, is there, we've got a week left in the month. So is there anything I should be aware of knowing that?  And then we can go into to just general updates on deals or anything that you want to chat through with me today.  Sound good?

26:06 - AcquiMatch Team
  Yeah, yeah, yeah, I would say just to start off there then Number one we've talked about as far that this is you could be a just you know, he's coming up um, potentially the end so we're trying to get him as much dealful as possible um We presented him an online business and then we've done two um temperature checks with him Recently on a business in texas in an online business a smaller business, but he's expressed interest in that business model So we're we're just firing what we do Right now.  So that's where i'm with him um In terms of like concerned right, so we're sorry i was concerned second one is probably just Jason not in terms of Age before we move on.  Sure.

26:55 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  We got the the leads guy working yet.
  ACTION ITEM: Follow up w/ leads gen company re: timeline for first leads - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/218640014?timestamp=1616.9999

26:58 - Anke Badenhorst
  Uh, yeah Up and right Up and running, so we're basically just waiting for the first leaves to come in.

27:04 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  How long does he anticipate before that happens?

27:07 - Anke Badenhorst
  They can guarantee like that, but they say it was running up and running the day after Ryan and at the onboarding call.  We got the email that it's up and running, so I'll check in today. If they need anything else from us, when can we anticipate the first lead?

27:27 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay, and have you followed up with Brian yet?

27:30 - Anke Badenhorst
  I'm working on Brian, so I'm working through the stuff that I need to respond to Brian.
  ACTION ITEM: Schedule call w/ Ryan & Brian to discuss Brian's questions - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/218640014?timestamp=1650.9999

27:36 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay, when you reckon you'll be able to do that?

27:41 - Anke Badenhorst
  I wanted to respond to him today, but the questions that he asked feels like a bit outside of the scope that I can answer him, so I think we need to get with Ryan on getting those answers to him.

27:54 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Why don't you guys just schedule a call? Was Brian? Yeah, yeah.

28:01 - Anke Badenhorst
  Yeah, I think that's a good idea. I'll check with Ryan the best time and then I'll schedule with Brian.

28:07 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, Brian.

28:08 - Anke Badenhorst
  Yeah, just so I can just get on a call with him so he can like work up his, he's got to get a proposal over to me and that's going to take some time too.

28:16 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So I just don't want to hold up that process from happening. So he said if it's too hard to install this on email, let's just jump on a call.

28:23 - AcquiMatch Team
  quicker me to do it that way. Okay, great. Jason, you were going to say Ryan, carry on. Yes, I didn't mean to keep continuing on.  going to start. Yeah, give me a pause after each call.

28:35 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  know. I did this every time.

28:38 - AcquiMatch Team
  Wait, wait, Jason, everything's good with Jason though I think we only have one right at first. So Luke actually had another one that we are excited about and the brother just decided to go on vacation for a week starting today, Luke.

28:58 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah, well, we don't know how long he's on. I got was that he's traveling starting today.

29:04 - AcquiMatch Team
  So, so we need if there's another concern, it's, we need to get Jason another right up before the end of the month.

29:12 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay.

29:12 - Luke Gillespie
  I don't think Jason is the concern, though. We've talked about JB as the concern.

29:17 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So, but we will be able to get Jason another one before the end of the month.

29:21 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah.

29:23 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  We'll get the contract checker.

29:25 - AcquiMatch Team
  So let get him something. Exactly. That's why I said he's. And then Luke just referenced JB. We haven't got him a second deal, but I mean, I think we may be close.  I think there's, I think there might be an LMI done here in the next, you know, week. So they had a meeting today.  We mean Joe talked about it. Yeah, I went. It was good enough that if there is some back and forth.  I think it's all within the range of getting done, right? So I feel really good about that one. Yeah, so if there was a concern about...

30:11 - Anke Badenhorst
  He sent over the Cool Wizards LOI draft and model. He sent that over to you, Ryan and Athena, a while ago.  Not a while ago, just a bit ago.

30:24 - AcquiMatch Team
  So I did tell him I would review that with you, which was going to be the next thing. Although I was looking at it before this.  He didn't fill out the LOI template. He left a lot of it blank. So I told him, like, it final and draft so we can review and he didn't do that.  But we can look at the model.

30:43 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  I get it all together so that I, you know, back to back all day tomorrow too. So it's just, I'll try to do it in between things.  then worst case, we can do it on our ketchup tomorrow.

30:57 - AcquiMatch Team
  Okay, cool. I can tell him that. Um, I told him I would review it with you tonight, he said he really wants, and I actually pushed him, I said, I think you should try to submit this by end of day tomorrow.  Um, he was like, okay, tell me what you have, try to get as close to completion as possible, and I will review it with a theme.  Uh, so we could do it.

31:20 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, I'm, I gotta go back upstairs really two more hours.

31:25 - AcquiMatch Team
  No problem.

31:26 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  I can. Check with me before you give up and timings like that, uh, just, just to make sure. Um, but yeah, tomorrow during our catch up, we'll have time to do it.

31:35 - AcquiMatch Team
  Okay, I didn't promise anything. I just said, okay, it was more of a, I said, oh, let's do this for you.  I didn't, you didn't ask for it or anything. I said, doesn't have to be able to look at it.  I had some time with a . was all.

31:47 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, I'm gonna fill out the L.A.Y though. I like looked at the call notes and it said the seller didn't want like legalays and stuff like that, which made me a little weary about what, what Joe wants to submit.

31:59 - AcquiMatch Team
  They don't want what?

32:00 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  This is. Cellar didn't want like legal ease in the L.O.I. something like that, or it was in your call notes with Joe.  The conversation you had with him earlier, the Cellar doesn't want an L.O.I. template, or what was the crux of that conversation?

32:21 - AcquiMatch Team
  I don't remember any of that.

32:24 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  No? Okay. Well, fathom then pulled really weird notes because it said that the Cellar didn't want to sign something that looked like a legal document.

32:35 - Anke Badenhorst
  Okay.

32:36 - AcquiMatch Team
  Yeah. Now, the conversation was, I talked with the Cellar before the meeting, and I said, Joe, don't try to push him to sign anything when you're there.  This is just a conversation. Even if you guys agree on everything, send them the L.O.I. tomorrow. Don't try to get him to sign up with people.  He said he doesn't want to be pressured about signing those.

32:56 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Got it. fathom pulled some weird notes. Let's then look at that note set fathoms pulling and make sure that it's like Because we're sending those to clients now So just have a check of the ones that eat us posting and make sure not right the second But just have a quality check to make sure that because I was like, I wanted to know what was going on So I checked and I was like, okay Um, but yeah, if you can get Joe to fill out the template tonight Then that way you and I can review it tomorrow on our call He'll get feedback before midday and then he can get something over to the seller end of day Perfect Awesome.  Nice work on that. Okay.

33:33 - AcquiMatch Team
  So we need another well He's probably focused on that but ideally we want another jb tool too Right, exactly.  I was just saying like, okay, if you're concerned with jb is if something happens in this doesn't start He's gonna immediately think look the next thing So let's get him something and we we haven't found anything really good lately So that's a little bit concerning but I got you know, I like I like where he is in the  this current. This is the best we've ever been with JB at this very moment, like those close together something.

34:06 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay, um, let's check in on it early this week, see where we're at, and if we need to have a conversation with him, we've been diverting your resources to supporting him on this off-market, and just deal flow has been a little bit slow in January.  I think he's probably little bit more understanding, and especially now that we have something for him to sink his teeth in, Jason has wanted to concern with me, because he's monthly contract checking us.  Okay, cool. How are the rest of them looking?

34:40 - Luke Gillespie
  We will meet contract minimums for all of them, and definitely Jason, don't worry about that. got it.

34:49 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Nice work, y'all. Okay, so how are the rest of the client's students?

34:53 - Anke Badenhorst
  How's Jenny doing on her, she making an offer? is she at?

34:58 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah, I heard her with two write-ups this week. So, nice job.

35:04 - AcquiMatch Team
  I've never reviewed the ones that I put the one look good. She just messaged Ryan, I think.

35:10 - Luke Gillespie
  She said, she's having a call with Barlow Williams tomorrow and hoping to get the LOI out ASAP after that.

35:18 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  That's amazing. I'm here with them right now. I'm so funny. was like, you guys really see you through Zoom.  I've never been in person. And I turned up yesterday, we were in like double leopard print and the rhymes would be any pack.  James David was like, the room just got a whole lot shinier. I was like, oh, y'all haven't seen the full epine yet.

35:36 - Luke Gillespie
  have you. It's hilarious.

35:41 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  James David is the super serious one.

35:43 - Luke Gillespie
  know, they're so fun.

35:46 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  But yeah, they're they're presenting lawyers here and they're saying good things about us too. So, that's amazing.

35:52 - Luke Gillespie
  Oh, great.

35:53 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So, she's gonna make an offer. It's still available. That's exciting. We've looked at the modeling and everything. We're getting her.  other opportunities so she's able to like gut check the one that she's on. How's that going right with her?

36:07 - Luke Gillespie
  I'm sorry go ahead Luke. There was a power washing business I just submitted to her this weekend. I introduced her to the broker today she wants to meet the broker so I think things are going well with Jin.

36:19 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Nice work. How's her confidence level?

36:26 - AcquiMatch Team
  I think she'll get, she's bright so she'll just pick up more confidence as she gets more experience.

36:35 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Great. How about Jason? How's he doing on his L.O.Y.?

36:44 - AcquiMatch Team
  So Jason broke down turns on a sheet, went to meet with the seller and it seems like they've got to an agreement on terms and they've signed a piece of paper on terms but it's  on L.O.I. So my conversation with him after this is going to be about what it he in the L.O.I.  but the L.O.I. don't. He's still like hesitant on being pushy about this. Like, well, I don't know if that's necessary.  Like, maybe this is enough. I'm like, put it. If that's going to be a problem, then just to hash it out right now, you know.  So I have a call with him here in 15, 12 minutes about what to do next. I'm going to be like, great, awesome.  got him to accept the salary note. And they've agreed on the 1.7 million price. That's completely Jason. They have the exact conversation.  told him he's told me to have with him, which is, is this the business? Because he's pushing up the price higher than initially said, right?  Like, I told him, like, you initially want to offer 1.4, I think you can save one. 0.5, 1.6, we say 1.7, which is higher than you initially said, you were open to, now you're going 0.1,.7, Well, I think this is a great business, is this, and okay, as long as you think that, but realize like the debt service is getting weaker, you understand that, right?  I said, now look, we played with the model, if you get some growth, you're fine, but if you don't get growth, you're in trouble, and he's like, okay, well that's your decision, you know, telling you, me, I would probably try to get back to 1.6.  So, he's like, okay, he left, we came back, like, we're at 1.7, so, looks like he's going to move forward to 1.7, he wants to ask me, if in the note, he should, if in the, if in the LY, he should put seller grace to note between five to ten percent, or  Just to just try to get him to sign on 10 percent the reason is that Jason's been saying the bank is going to want you to hold a note and The seller is saying well, let's get in front of a bank and see what they say He's like I'm willing to hold five ten percent if that's what the bank is saying they want And so he's like should I put five ten percent and then go with the bank Or should I say five or ten percent direct instead of a reach?  That's what he wants to talk to me about that coffee hour So he's gonna need a signed L.O.I.

39:37 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  to get financing Right, so even if he doesn't want to sign the document, he's not gonna get taken seriously Landers if he doesn't have a signed L.O.I That's what they're gonna ask for they're gonna ask for his modeling they're gonna ask for his L.O.I when he goes out To start getting term sheets So put time  1% and if the guy will sign them 5%, right? The bank doesn't care whether the seller takes a note or not.  So he's not giving the guy accurate information. But like what we were talking about earlier with Mike, like he's not going to get 100% at close.  So either you take it as a note and you get interest on it, or it's held back an indemnification, right?

40:26 - AcquiMatch Team
  Oh, that was a whole back door.

40:28 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  At least a year.

40:32 - AcquiMatch Team
  That's the bank requires that.

40:35 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  No, he should. Like that is a good legal team behind you is like you give him 100% at close if there's  fraud or anything like you get nothing back.

40:45 - AcquiMatch Team
  No, I'm not that screw.

40:48 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So the that's that's like any good lawyer will make sure that you're holding back something in escrow. It's not the bank's requirement, but like we  should not be advising buyers ever to give 100% at close, and they should have a legal team that's also advising them of that, right?  Because if there's any fraud or any issues that come up, they're not going to be able to get that money back.  So there should be money going into an escrow account and then they get after a year. And that is standard.  Like I hear up to 30% of the purchase gotcha. So is Jason going to get legal advice at this point?

41:36 - AcquiMatch Team
  is he just signing an app again? No, he's he's got with bottom lawyers.

41:43 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay, so get assigned L.O.I. you know, shoot for 10% ideally. But if he only signs five, that's fine too.  The banks that are going to requirement and then like after he's under offer and starts going through the lending process, which is he's going to get his  handed to.  You know why he's gonna have to sell he's gonna have to give him the modeling he's gonna have to defend his position the whole thing Once he gets a term sheet or they start looking under the hood on the business Then like then he can kind of use ends like well, this is what's going on whatever the QV You can do a retreat if he needs to so I think at this point like It's a small enough margin that like he can sign the deal But he needs he needs to have a good L.O.I.  in place You know for the the lending process for what comes next That's what I would advise him to like lenders are gonna be like you don't even have enough sign.  Oh, I like okay Like I'm kind of give you some feedback on this or whatever, but like it's to his interest to have a signed L.O.I And I'm glad he's talking about the Williams too, so

43:00 - AcquiMatch Team
  Okay, good. Okay.

43:01 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Cool. Um, exciting times all around. How's Chris doing?

43:06 - AcquiMatch Team
  Chris is great. We got of two businesses who like, he likes them both. Um, I even told him about that off market warehouse business in the Northeast that has like five different locations because I just told they have an off market and I haven't found for anyone.  I just want to run it by you. that sounds interesting. He's like, let's do it. So, uh, so I'm going to start looking and maybe writing that up for him.

43:31 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Are they still interested in selling?

43:33 - AcquiMatch Team
  Have you engaged with them? I talked with them right before Christmas and they were like, and I was like, guys, I'm sorry, I have not found anybody for you guys.  I can keep looking though. I still have more clients so I can keep looking and they're like, I can't just keep looking.  said, okay. And then so that's why it was on my mind and we were talking. He's like, I'm fine to New York.  And one of the places in New York and I said, Hey, what do you think about this? And I told him about it.  And he's like, yeah, let's do it. So, um, I'm gonna try to do that as well Love it.

44:05 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  . Yeah, let's go Yeah, Chris is doing great.

44:08 - Luke Gillespie
  He's being aggressive I he should have had a broker call today for the self-order roofing company and then there's a Texas career company as well He introduced him to the broker the day I sent him the write-up.  So yeah Awesome, and Gil, how's he doing?

44:24 - AcquiMatch Team
  It was good. He's got a big big week. got a sour call scumptered for him tomorrow If you're getting a sour call with an on-market deal next week So he's he's busy And you're getting him past the the resistance so you're getting him to start taking action.  What was the game changer there? He said he watched that video that we did about the relationships that he was like, okay, I Understand what you guys are saying now.

44:52 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  That's what he said Yeah, let's go Um, have we heard from Alex?

45:03 - AcquiMatch Team
  No, we checked on with her once a week? Not this week. We checked with her last week.

45:10 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay. Let's make sure we're going to pulse on her and checking and seeing how she's doing. Uh, Brian, anything there?  Did he look at the gas station? We heard, I don't have our call with him on.

45:25 - AcquiMatch Team
  Two news day, um, and I went over the businesses with him. said, Hey, why don't you put together your thoughts and send them to me by Wednesday at the same time.  I said, okay. Yeah, then done it. I thought I wasn't today. I haven't heard back yet. So I'll keep pulling up for them.

45:41 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Cool. Yeah. Let's just keep like on the clients that are ghosting a little bit, like let's be the one chasing them and not not allowing them to continue to go to us, right?  Um, who am I missing? Is that everyone?

45:55 - Anke Badenhorst
  It's me.

45:57 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Oh, yeah.

46:00 - Luke Gillespie
  SP, we got them one write up and they weren't interested in the business and now I don't have anything right now that I'm going to do a write up for but I'm sure I'll find something next week and I also have an online business that I might repurpose for them.

46:16 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay and then it sounded like Polly's feedback that the business we handed them was outside of the industries they were interested in, do we know what happened in there?

46:25 - AcquiMatch Team
  Yeah they said that they weren't interested in their retail but they have told me Ryan just send us things, they're like we're okay with going outside of the industries that we initially selected, send us things so we can think things through, like we'd rather just see volume and so we brought that to me and I said no let's let's send that to it's a retail store it's not rocket science to take that thing over long history so it was together  Yes, we put it together and I said, let's just skip their feedback and we just get them looking at something.  So, they just said no and I explained why we chose to set it to them and we won't wait for them anymore.

47:14 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay. Did we have the come to Jesus with them about like either Paulie needs to start taking calls or they need to move quicker or make time available for Steve?

47:25 - AcquiMatch Team
  I covered all those points with her and I told her this is what I think told them you guys back.  She said, I agree. We'll try to do it that way. They said, hey, why don't you, instead of trying to be on the same call at time, get Steve to provide all his feedback on paper for you and then come to the seller call if he can't make it with those questions, if he really likes the business, it goes well, you can always try to get them on the second call.

47:49 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay. What are the chances of us getting two more to them before the end of the month?

47:56 - AcquiMatch Team
  No, we got two of them this month, right? got the landscaping business and we got.

48:00 - Luke Gillespie
  uh the retail store right oh okay so if we get them one more then it'll be two that we're in their buy box yeah one more okay so three in total and because that content side that we mentioned for Andrew I feel like Andrew is probably not gonna like it so I was thinking of having that for SP because it's an SP they love content sites it's one of those absentee low SD opportunities so yeah awesome uh it sounds like everything is in a really great place y'all yeah anything else you should be aware of or anything I can help you all with no I have two write-ups for AA that I'm we're just waiting to submit and the one like I wrote at the first week like January 3rd and so I reached out to the broker today hey my buyer's dealing with some health issues right now they can't make decision to move for
