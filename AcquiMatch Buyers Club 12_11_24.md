# AcquiMatch Buyers Club 12/11/24

[00:00:00] 

**Athena:** Hello. Hey, Jason. How's it going? I think we got Andrew somewhere in there too. Yay. Hey, 

**Andrew:** Andrew. 

**Athena:** How's it going? 

**Andrew:** Good. How are you guys? 

**Athena:** Good. Good. I love it. My real estate folks are here. We're going to be talking real estate today. So, um, excited. Um. And that was the plan basically was to show you all how real estate can be structured with SBA.

There's like different loans and different ways of playing it and like some different tools. So, when you're looking at a deal, and you see that there's real estate involved, there's some things to think about. So that's what I was going to take you through. I've got an outline there. Um, are there any burning topics that y'all want to discuss today?

So I can bear that in mind with my timings.

No, feeling good. Ready to learn soak it in. [00:01:00] 

**Jason:** Let's go. 

**Athena:** Okay, cool. Um, and then we're going to obviously record this. We'll summarize it and I'm working on a master. I didn't realize like, how much stuff is just in my head. So we're working on a master resource for SBA. Um, that's not just an internal 1 that we use for training.

So, um. Um, building this out, uh, and we'll have it to you all, but if you want the notes or anything before we get that completed, the idea is we're going to have one master thing. Um, but if you want these notes, then, um, give the team a shout and we can get that sorted. So let me share my screen. All right.

Can you see my screen? 

Yeah. 

**Athena:** Okay, cool. Um, so Real estate's a really interesting tool in, uh, business buying. Um, so obviously, uh, a lot of you are familiar with, you know, the upsides of real estate and investing in real estate. But when we're looking [00:02:00] at using SBA loans and there's, uh, there's real estate involved in the deals, there's some considerations that we can have and also some cool tools that you can unlock to make your deal even better.

So one of the main things that real estate can unlock is. Changing your whole loan to a 25 year amortization schedule. So 7a is what we use for business acquisition loans. So that's the, like when we're talking about SBA loans for a business acquisition, we're almost always referring to 7a, but if you've got real estate that's involved in your deal, we can unlock a 25 year amortization.

If the real estate portion. represents 51 percent or more of the total loan amount. So if it's less than 51%, then the loan is amortized over the standard 10 years. And then we might want to consider whether we want to use some of these other real estate focused loans instead of [00:03:00] SBA if we don't get that 25 year amortization.

So what that means is 7a Has a cap of 5, 000, 000 per borrower. So when you have a deal that it makes sense to, like, it would make sense to the business debt service coverage ratio to have that real estate included and amortize it over longer times along a lot of times that gives you a more competitive offer that you can make because you can spread the payments out over 25 years.

If you include the real estate. Now, that will all count towards your 5 million cap on 7a. So when you're thinking about this, we can talk about it with your deal specifically, but it's just something for you to think about. Um, then there's other SBA loans, like related to real estate. The main one is the SBA 504.

So it's for real estate and long term equipment financing and you can do a 25 year amortization on this and it still requires that 10 percent equity [00:04:00] injection and that can also include seller financing as part of your equity injection. Like we talked about last time. And there is a 5. 5 million cap on this.

Per project. So whereas seven A is a total of 5 million in total for you as a borrower, right? 5 0 4 is per project. So you could essentially do multiple 5 0 4 deals. With a 5. 5 million dollar cap, um, and the rates on those are currently around 6%. So what you could potentially do is marry them up and I'll talk about that later, but I just want to go over the types 1st.

Now, there's another type called SBA 504 green and it's a specialized version of the 504 and it rewards you creating. Are you buying real estate and making some adjustments to the property and I'll go through that in a minute too, but it's energy efficiency and environmental type stuff. [00:05:00] There's no cap on that.

If the criteria is met, and it allows. Unlimited contributions there, so. That's another opportunity, and I'm going to give you guys an episode of acquiring mines where some people have used the 504 in a really interesting way. So some things that you want to think about for strategies is in order to qualify for the 25 year amortization on 7a, that real estate needs to be 51 percent or more of the total loan amount.

Um, so if you have, for example, a 3 million loan and the real estate is 1. 6%, then you get 25 year amortization. If the real estate is less than 51 percent of the total loan amount, then it's amortized over 10 years. And what you could do is potentially use a combination of financing, like seller financing to address the, [00:06:00] this.

So, um, what's really important is you want to, when you're doing real estate as part of your deal is that you should not. Value them together. They still need to be valued separately and appraise separately. So my real estate folks, you know how to appraise real estate. It should still be done separately and the business needs to be valued separately.

They need to be valued as 2 separate entities. And in the ways that we value real estate and businesses differently, and they both need to stand up on their own, right? You just might put them into the same 7a loan. So it's not appraising it all together. It absolutely needs to be separated. Um, so what's cool, though, if you want to unlock that 25 year amortization is that you might be able to negotiate a seller seller note for the business portion.

To keep the real estate above 51 percent of the total law. [00:07:00] So then you might say, Mr. Seller, I'm going to offer you this much money. You know, I'm valuing your real estate at this amount. I'm valuing your business at this amount. Your seller notes going to be this much. So then the total of the loan would be the actual loan to the bank.

If you have the real estate is more than 51%, then you can unlock those 25 year amortization. Um, so this, um, episode of acquiring minds, um, talks about using, um, it's actually in the wrong section. So I'll update it. But this, uh, acquiring minds episode talks about these guys who were using 504 and that 5. 5 cap on the 504, because there's no overall cap from the buyer or, and they were going around and buying auto repair shops.

And they were using 504 to finance the real estate and then they were doing a seller note for the business portion. So the seller got [00:08:00] paid outright for the real estate and then did a seller note for the, um, business portion. So, then they didn't have to go through the 7, a process. And that allows you to kind of bypass that pretty stringent and painful SBA process for a business.

If you're able to, like, negotiate that way, so, um, it's a really cool, um, episode and they talk about how they see themselves having 2 different portfolios. 1 is a business portfolio. And 1 is a real estate portfolio. So, the primary use of the funds. Determines amortization, so where are the loan proceeds going towards?

Does that make sense? So it's basically total loan amount if more than 51 percent of that loan is going towards the real estate portion on a 7, a loan, then you can unlock that 25 year amortization and then that seller note could reduce the amount towards the business, which could potentially. Get you towards that 51%.[00:09:00] 

**Jason:** Yeah. I had a question. Um, it seems like a good option to potentially spread out your risk over a longer period of time, but aren't you paying more interest in the long run? 

**Athena:** So you wanna, you wanna kind of factor that in, right? And Yeah. This, this is a tool on seven a. Like, if you're going to do it on 7a, I would say it's like when you're wanting to make a really competitive offer on the business that if you were to just do the business on its own, the debt service coverage ratio wouldn't work, but you are confident that you could grow it or that there's some opportunities there for you, but like, to get it signed off by SBA, if you're just doing the business alone, maybe you can't offer the kind of competitive offer that you can.

But if you added the real estate in and spread it out over 25 years, then the debt service coverage ratio is more favorable and allows you to make that competitive offer. 

**Jason:** Yeah, here's a crazy idea. What if you had a seller [00:10:00] that you're just trying to do an asset purchase, but they're leasing a property.

Could you reach out to the owner of that property and potentially like bundle that deal together so you can amortize the. The payments over a longer period of time, but you're still going to pay. Let's say you're going to, let's say the, you know, yeah, there's enough cashflow there to pay in 15 years or something.

**Athena:** You definitely need the seller's blessing to do that. Sometimes like the landlord is the very last person that finds out about a sale, so it could impact their relationship and stuff like that. I also think that potentially because it's two different owners that it might not work. That's a good question.

Um, Ana, can you write that one down so I can clarify like, 'cause you know, the, the proceeds from the loan go to different people like your legal team, your [00:11:00] QV or et cetera. I haven't heard of like a different owner and, uh, owner of the business and real estate before, but it's a good question. So we'll get that clarified for you, Jason, but you definitely wanna make sure you have the owner's blessing before you contact anyone and have any conversation.

Yeah, no, I get it. But I was thinking. 

**Jason:** It could give you a little bit more padding, right? You might pay more interest, but you know, you might be able to build up a bigger war chest. 

**Andrew:** Well, let me jump in here to Athena. I mean, I'm in the commercial real estate business. So I'm looking at 1 right now. I was just talking with Ryan about it earlier where it's, uh, you know, the owner's done a really good job of paying himself rent on the building that he currently owns.

So, really, what you might be paying more interest, but you're diversifying your. Your your money in a different asset classes and so I would, I would venture to say, I mean, you look at just the appreciation over the course of a, you know, the 10 years for the amortization period of a standard SBA loan.

That property is going to grow and [00:12:00] value substantially more than that. You know, the, the interest spread there, and then the 2nd thing, I, I think it's a good idea on what you were saying around the. Um, this potentially buying the property, but yeah, that would be the sellers first thought when they, when you call them, they're thinking I'm losing my tenant.

I'm going to do that guy out ASAP. So it'd be a very, very hyper specific use where you could reach out to the seller. That would probably for most people, but, you know, at the same time, a lot of these businesses that we all look at, you know. Small mom and pop have been in the same building for 30 years.

And so maybe they have a great relationship with the seller and the seller is in the exact same scenario where they want to exit the property. So I think it's a good idea to look at and just be a little terrified of asking without making sure that the seller is okay with that. 

**Athena:** Yeah. So one of the things actually, while we're on the real estate point, um, and this is totally off topic.

Um, topic of like, using the loans, but 1 of the things that can happen [00:13:00] that blows up the deal a lot is the seller waiting until the final hour to make this is after you're under offer. You've gotten through due diligence. You're drafting up the purchase agreement. You got the commitment letter from the bank.

The bank requires you 10 year. Lease or at least the option to extend for 10 years if you have a physical premises and if you don't have a lease agreement like that already in place, or you can't get a lease agreement from the new owner, then it can end up causing a lot of problems for you actually closing the deal.

So, if the seller is kind of dragging their feet on facilitating that conversation, you want to try to, you know, at the right point, but not to wait in the deal, make sure that you have the. Owner of the properties buy in that they will give you something that says, you at least have the option for 10 years.

So the SBA wants to see at least agreement for the total term of the loan. If you're doing 10 years. That's on the least property, not 1 that you're [00:14:00] buying. Does that make sense?

Yeah, so that's really important. Just something that comes up a lot at the 11th hour and I know, um, Lindsay and Kevin face that and they were able to overcome it in some ways. But, um, you know, sometimes the, the owners of the property don't want to give you that whole deal can fall apart just because the owner of the property is like, I don't want to do that.

**Andrew:** That's kind of a tough ask. I mean, is it really? That's a lot of owners do not want to be tied up for that long period, even if it's just an option. Have you seen creative ways to get around that? I mean, just like, you know, market rate 5 years from now, like, just because you can't negotiate. That's the biggest factor is that they don't want to know.

They don't know what the rates are going to be 5 years from now. And they don't want to give it to you now or commit themselves to that. I mean, have you seen those go through with just a committed? You know, like, yeah, you got a 5 year extension beyond this initial 5 year term, but it's going to be [00:15:00] at market rates at that time.

Yeah, it doesn't have to 

**Athena:** be the, yeah, the SBA doesn't care about the price. They want to know that you have the option to stay there. Cool. So, yeah, you can negotiate the terms with the seller and obviously they'd want to make sure that they're, you know. Potentially getting increases if that's necessary and I've heard of some people overcoming that in some ways.

So, like, when Lindsay or Kevin joined next time, we can ask them how they did that with the deal that they currently were on. Because I know that was an issue. So, sometimes you're able to overcome that. I guess the point there is don't wait too long to start having that conversation. So, you kind of know what you're dealing with with the landlord and also Jason to your point.

Okay. Um, you know, some other things that you could potentially do is, you know, buy the business on 7 a, then approach the owner about buying it, buying the property and use a 504 to be able to do that. So, and then you might be able to [00:16:00] refinance. So, it's typically at least 2 years before you can refinance with the SBA, but you might be able to then refinance.

If you needed, you know, the 25 year am on both the business and the real estate. So there's other ways that you can do that too. So the 504 loan, sorry, did that answer your question, Andrew, before I move on? Yeah. Good. Cool. Um, 504 loan is, is specifically for, you know, uh, real estate and you can use the 504 loan to separate from the 7a, and then it helps you unlock more.

70 value if you need it, um, and you can get a 25 year amortization on the real estate portion. If you want to do, like, if you want to buy the real estate in the business, and you're not able to get it to that 51 percent and you might want to do a separate 504 loan that you can at least amortize the real estate over 25 years.[00:17:00] 

Um, And you could potentially do seller notes, uh, with the 504 also. Um, so if you're like, well, I don't have the capital requirements to be able to do 10 percent on the real estate and the business. Well, you can ask the seller to take a 10 percent equity injection standby full standby notes. The same, you know, being on full standby for 2 years and a 10 percent note.

That counts towards your equity injection to make up the, um, down payment requirements for that. So getting creative with the negotiations and the strategy. So, if Mr sellers, like, I want to get out of the real estate and you're like, I don't have enough money to be able to do both and, you know, cover the equity injection requirements.

Here's a little tool that you might be able to use to get the seller out of their real estate without you having to figure out where you're going to double your money. Um, and ideally, you're also getting them to take a note. At least 5 percent on the 7, a loan, like we talked about last [00:18:00] time. Um, so you can do multiple 504 loans for separate properties without hitting an aggregate cap.

So, with 7, a, there's a 5, 000, 000 cap, but there are instances where you can overcome that with When you use a separate NA CIS code, I think I hope I said that in the right order. So like different designations of businesses can potentially unlock more 7a loan capability, but typically it's like per borrower.

Um, max you can do is 5 million. Also, if you're putting your partners on the loans, uh, you want to consider that because you might be able to do 5 million each if you separate it. So just something to think about there. Um, and then the SBA green, SBA 504 green, uh, if you find a, Place that you can either reduce [00:19:00] the energy use by 10 percent or generate 15 percent renewable energy, or get some sort of lead certification, or create some sustainability upgrades to it.

Then you can access the SBA 504. There's no, there's no cap on the number or size of the loan. If the criteria is met, and you can cover the, the, uh, equity injection requirements. So, for those of you that raise money from real estate investors, this is you could buy a pretty sizable real estate deals under 504.

if you commit to using a consultant to help you do 1 of these. Different things like producing the energy or generate renewable energy, et cetera. Um, that's also on a 25 year amortization and current rates on both types of 504 look like they're around 6%. Um, so this is the episode that I actually wanted to drop.

I should have dropped it down there.[00:20:00] 

Where they use the 504 green to build their real estate portfolio while also, um, buying, um, businesses through using, um, seller notes. So it's pretty cool. Um, and then you can combine this 7a and 504 loans. So it just, you know, thinking about working capital, you want to model it out, right? Like, Would it be more advantageous for you to include it all in 1 deal?

So you can unlock that 25 year am on the business portion, or does it stand alone on its own? And you could do a 504 and a 7 a separately. Um, and then are there ways to bring the seller in the mix to, you know, seller finance some portion of either side of it, if not both. Um, to be able to do much bigger deal sizes than you might have been able to do just if you were using your 10 percent and asking the seller for nothing and not looking at real estate.

**Andrew:** You know, can [00:21:00] I ask a quick question real quick? Yes. Um, just out of curiosity, obviously, we're talking about this in regard to purchasing a business, but we're all here to do that. 504 that's in that eligible loan for anybody. What you don't have to have any relation to business whatsoever. And you can still be eligible as long as you can.

Increase that by 10 to 15 percent from energy efficiency standpoint. Is that correct? 

**Athena:** Um, that's a good question. I've never done like, I'm not the real estate girl. So I've only done. I 

**Andrew:** know. I, I, I didn't know. I can look that up. I didn't know. No, no, no. That's another good question. 

**Athena:** So I'll get Anna. Anna's taking notes of all the questions we need to clarify.

I think you need to be already be a business though, to be able to access. Yeah, I would assume. Yeah. So, I just didn't know it. It's a good question. I haven't been involved in any. Okay. Thing where people weren't trying to do it alongside a business, but those guys are doing 504s and doing seller notes for the business.

[00:22:00] So it might be because they're already a business entity. Let me clarify that and we'll get you the answer on that. It's a good question. Thanks, because I, I can make assumptions all day long, but I always like to check with them to make sure because the SBA can be interesting. Um, cool. So there's some, you know, just examples here.

Like, if you were to use, um, 7, a, and just make sure that the real estate was more than 51%, you get a 25 year amortization. But the other thing with. The 7 a, when you do that, is it's going to be the same interest rate for everything. So you're going to be paying that interest rate that that higher interest rate on the real estate.

Um, so that's a big consideration, right? When you can do a 5 or 4, which is going to be more at 6%, whereas 7 days.

Um, but in some instances, like I said, it makes sense when you want to be a little [00:23:00] bit more advantageous on the, um, uh, overall deal with the seller, um, and and make that work. Um, so you can also do 7 a, where the real estate isn't more than 51%, but that's only a 10 year amortization. Again. It's all at the same interest rate.

Um, maybe you want to do a 504 loan with, you know, 24 amortization, 25 amortization on the real estate, and then you do the whole business via a seller note. Um, so that's a pretty cool. Opportunity there, if you have a good relationship, it seems to be that, um, when folks already have a business in the industry that they are purchasing, they have a much easier time doing seller finance.

With future owners, so I've heard this across multiple industries, like, very difficult. If you don't already, like, for the auto repair example, [00:24:00] if you already own an auto repair shop, and you approach an auto repair owner about this, then you have the kind of credibility that they feel a little bit more comfortable with a situation like this.

So, it's a long shot if it's your 1st time, and you don't have industry experience, but I just want to tell you all the tools available so that when it comes time. You're not learning about them for the 1st time, and we can talk about the different strategies and stuff and then a green loan expansion. Um, you know, if you want even larger projects, you can do substantially larger deals.

There's no cap on the green loan. So for. My real estate folks, you know, might be a fun one for you to put in the mix. If you come across a property that's quite large that you didn't think you were going to be able to do on your own. Um, so that was everything I was going to talk about with real estate in SBA loans.

How did that feel? Did that make sense?[00:25:00] 

**Andrew:** Yeah, I think it's helpful. And you'd made that that you guys had helped make a version of the template that has real estate. I'm sure everybody else has access to that too. That that was super helpful and writing those figures on one spreadsheet. 

**Athena:** I know Ryan's been doling it out, but can we look and make sure that we have, um, the 25 year amortization template also on the dashboards for everybody to access and we'll link to that when we post the recap here.

So everybody knows where to find it. But. Um, we are going to be creating some new templates that are a little bit. Less finance scary, hopefully that are a little bit more straightforward. Um, but, yeah, we do have the, the 25 year template that I know Ryan's been sharing with people when they're looking at real estate.

Um, so it's cool to just kind of, like, mess around with things and that's the thing I love about structuring. [00:26:00] Is that there's pretty much endless possibilities of how you can layer these different tools, like seller notes and real estate and the different types of loans available to see if you can. You know, they call it, like, you know, make it deeper, but, like, make it work.

Like, will it work? And are there different ways that we can get creative and, you know, with the seller? Like, they might just have a number in mind. So then we know all the terms and we know all the tools in the tool kit. So we can, like, pull those out and start seeing how we can, like, put them all together and shape something up, um, to make it resemble that number.

But it's not on their terms. It's on our terms. So, um, I think you all have heard this before, but my price, your terms, your price, my price, your terms, your price, my terms. 

**Andrew:** Yeah, 

**Athena:** Ryan's laughing. I think I messed up the 

**Ryan:** George Bush, you know, 

**Athena:** my price, your terms. [00:27:00] Yeah. My price, your terms, your terms, my price, 

**Andrew:** I think I know this is kind of you kind of spoke to this, but I'm just kind of curious your thoughts.

I mean, I mean, this is referencing a, you know, a deal we're looking at right now. Where, you know, just being in the industry, like the real estate is definitely overvalued from what I would bring on the marketplace. Um, but this guy's also relatively savvy and, you know, you've got it in order for it to make sense.

You've got to meet that 51 percent and that really helps everybody's numbers. So, you kind of spoke to it as having it as 2 separate transactions, which is obviously the best way to look at that. You know, do you think that's a little bit more of the, you know, their price, my terms where you can kind of get a little bit more creative and get comfortable paying a little bit more than you should for the real estate, knowing that it's going to help your amp schedule and help that, you know, overall dfcr.

**Athena:** [00:28:00] Yeah, I mean, so if you have, okay, so the seller's like, no, this is the price I want for the real estate. Um, you know, you all are a little bit more experience in terms of, like, what that actually means for the valuation. Everything of the real estate. So I know, you know, the risk there of, like, overpaying for a piece of real estate as far as, like, the.

The business buying is concerned, that is a way to sweeten the pot if you can figure out how to make it work. And if you can access 2 different types of loans, right? Like, we'll do 7, a 4. The business and then 504 over a 25 year am at 6 percent for the real estate. Um, or, you know, then you can say, like, okay, well, I know you want this much, but here's how we're going to do it.

We're going to, you're going to give me a much bigger note. You're going to put it on full standby for 2 years so that I can actually pay your price because I don't have the capital. You know, you don't need to tell them that. But if you don't have the capital requirements to be able to do the whole 10 percent equity injection across the board, [00:29:00] that's where you can use that equity injection note from the seller.

It's like, okay, you want that. Here's how it's going to go. Like, so note. On standby for 2 years, that's going to allow me to do it. And then when you do the numbers on the projections for the business, you know, you're going to charge yourself whatever rent that makes sense to you. So you can keep paying yourself on the rent if that's what he was doing or whatever.

And then you set up, you still want to set up 2 separate entities for that, too, and keep it separate, even if you might be putting both in the same 7 day. So I would model it in a 7 day all together. And then I would model it separately, and then mess around with the seller note terms and see, like, if I get them to increase the note or take it as, um, you know, maybe it's just a straight up note, a bigger note at a lower interest rate, or maybe it's an equity injection note, then can I make it work and feel comfortable and my debt service coverage ratio, paying [00:30:00] those mortgage payments.

Or paying the loan payments to the 504 still work and come at the 1. 5 and

**Ryan:** 4. 

**Athena:** Yeah, so that's why we always tell you guys, like, you know, if the price of the business is like. In range, right? Not necessarily a direct hit. This is we're playing around with the terms can make it favorable for you. So, like, rejecting a business because the go, the real estate's overvalued. Well, there's a lot of things you can do there to potentially make it actually more worth your while.

If you're able to. You know, put off payments for a couple of years, or, you know, have him sell or finance a large portion of it at a lower interest rate, et cetera, or use that 504 loan at a 6 percent interest rate, rather than stacking the whole thing in the 7a at a 10 percent interest rate. So, when you play around with the, the different scenarios, then you can [00:31:00] get creative and get a feeling for what's important to him.

Is it his number or a lot of times what I'll do is I'll have a conversation with them. What are you gonna do with the money afterwards? Like, what are your plans? You want to retire? And, you know, like, they might, they might be beholden to a number because of a specific life event that they need, or it might just be like, that's what they think their business is worth.

And it's an ego thing. And it's like, okay, we can get you there. But it's just going to be over time and then when they see that amount, like I always take a snapshot of that amount at the bottom, the amount to the seller, when they see the total amount with interest, if they were to take a seller note, it usually ends up being more than what they wanted.

It's just not all paid at once. So there's different ways of playing it, but I think it's, you know, this is where that rapport building comes in with the seller, finding out what's important to them. They might. Have their eye on a yacht they want to buy, and they need a certain amount of money to buy it as soon as [00:32:00] they sell, or they, they have a certain amount in their mind for retirement and they just want to make sure they're making that every year.

And they might like it better to get paid out over time. You know, capital gains tax is going to be significantly less. If they do that, and it's like assured money every year. They just know that that at least their basic needs are being covered every year. So a lot of times it's figuring out what's important to them about that number or in the sale.

And like, you know, I, I just. Have fun with it instead of being like, what do you want? I'm like, what are you going to do after? Like, you know, you've been doing this for 30 years. So, like, what's the plan next? You know, and like, just finding out more about them and actually, while we're on this note, Ryan and I are going to tag team a call on Thursday about.

Seller meetings and like how to play it, what your strategy is, what you're trying to get out of it, how to build rapport, all that sort of stuff. So this is one of those things that I typically do is people love talking about themselves and they love feeling like you're interested and you're listening and you can get all the [00:33:00] information you need just by asking questions differently and you can find out their motivation.

So it's like, what are you going to do after? Gosh, you've been working for like 30 years and you've not taken a vacation, you know, like, what are you going to do with the money? Like, Are you going to go buy a yacht? You know, and then they'll tell you what they're planning on doing. And it's like, well, you know, what's, what's important to you in this?

Like, what are you hoping to achieve from this? Why are you getting out now? Like really understanding their motivations because it's going to come up later in the conversation. I can't wait for this call 

**Jason:** because I just finished never split the difference. I was trying to do all the labeling and mirroring on my last call.

It didn't work. The mirroring didn't work. I tried it twice. He kind of just didn't say anything after that. 

**Athena:** What, do you remember the specific conversation or the, 

**Jason:** uh, I think I was asking him about, uh, you know, the real estate deal. I was asking him about his like six, six [00:34:00] point process to build a house.

You know, it's trying to mirror. What he was saying and it wasn't working. I probably shouldn't, this is where I just need some reps. Like maybe that's when you add in the, like the labeling and stuff like that. 

**Athena:** Yeah, I mean, early, so that's a good point and something Ryan and I can, um, make sure that we weave in, like, the different phases when you're talking to the seller and what to pull out at what point early on, I want them to like me, trust me and believe that I'm going to act in, like, their best interest as much as humanly possible.

Right? Because if they believe that we're working together and they like me, Okay. They'll go over and above so, you know, Lindsey and Kevin on their deal. I mean, it was incredible the way that they were like, there was a broker in the mix and they were able to like, basically not circumvent, but the broker was just comfortable enough to let him [00:35:00] all, you know, go together.

And we coach them like, okay, here's all the negotiation points. And this was like, towards the. Purchase agreement side, they just sat down with the seller and like seller. Basically, it was like, yep. We understand why you're doing that. Yep. We understand why you're doing that. Yep. We understand. So it was amazing because they had that trust and the seller.

I, you know, I, I went and met the seller tune and I think they see them as their proteges. They want them to win, you know, and so they were kind of doing whatever they needed to do to make sure that they were setting them up for success. Um, 

**Jason:** yeah, I think it's hard to make a connection over zoom. It's always different.

Like if you get in person, you actually, it's hard to pick up on cues. 

**Athena:** Yeah, the never split the different stuff is like amazing now and the more you figure out like what points to use what what tools and that sort of thing. But initially, like, I kind of played dumb. Right. Without them thinking that I am [00:36:00] a dumb person, but I'm just like, tell me more.

Like, how did you start this business? It's so exciting. You know, like, I mean, this is amazing. How did you even come up with this idea? And, and people love feeling on the receiving end of somebody that's just like soaking it up and wants to learn everything. And like, if, if they come off that call, like, I feel really good about that.

I just got to tell my story and this person cares and they're not just some random investor that's going to tear up my business. Then it just gets easier and easier and easier. And then, because you have that report bill, when it comes time to negotiate, they're going to trust that it's coming from a authentic place.

Right? And I think the, the real key in all of this is, There's there's authenticity that needs to come behind it when I'm asking people that and when I'm treating them that way. That's genuinely how I am. It's not to to achieve anything other than I want to build a relationship with this person. Because I know if I do, this whole process will go so much better.[00:37:00] 

Um, but we do need to negotiate and. Deal with humans and we get irrational at different points. So that never split. The different stuff is really helpful. 

**Jason:** Yeah, the whistle brain gets in the way. So it's like the never split, the differences. At least helpful to me as I feel like it's one of those books, like, I'm just going to have some examples.

Like, I feel like someone can create like an abridged version. Like, I don't need all these stories. Like, this is get down the brass tacks and tell me what I need to do. 

**Athena:** So, um, Jason, fun fact, when I first read that book, and when I was doing. My first like big negotiation that scared the crap out of me. It was with the car wash owner that wanted 3 million for his business when I, I estimated it was 1.

2 tops, right? And he was trying to value it like real estate, the whole thing. And I was like, that's not how we do businesses, you know? And so I was like, okay, I'm going to have to walk in there. [00:38:00] And I was using this scale. I forgot the exact name of it, but I was like, I'm going to walk in there and get to like 1.

2 tops and 

**Jason:** talks about that. This is a good chapter on 

**Athena:** that. It's incredible for like any time you're negotiating price, like never go in at your top, you know? So using that, that methodology, 

**Jason:** um, saying no, but saying no in like different ways. It's really good. 

**Athena:** But the, the, the tearing of like the starting with the 65%, then 85%, then 95%, then a hundred percent, but like a super exact number.

And I was talking to a friend and I was like, I don't know how I'm going to remember all these numbers. And he's like, Oh, well, when you guys are going back and forth, Pull out your phone and like pretend like you're doing calculations, but you just have the numbers written there and I was like, that's genius, you know, but like, it's like breaking it because I was like, how am I going to tell this guy that wants 3 million that I think like 1.

2 tops and my opening. Offer is going to be like 750, [00:39:00] 000, like was, but by that point, I had brought this guy like alien toys. Cause I knew he was an aliens. I'd spent a bunch of time with them. You know, like. He, he really genuinely liked me and we got along very well. So by me doing that, it wasn't coming from a place of like, you know, but in order to prepare for that meeting, I used chat GBT and I was like, you are coaching me as.

Um, Stephen Voss is his name, right? Chris Voss. Sorry. You were coaching me as Chris Voss, like, and you were going to help me with this. So I gave it all the parameters. I was like, stick to like what Chris Voss would do. I want to use this particular thing that I learned in this book. How do I structure this?

So I could just like role play with myself in GPT and get ahead of it. But it was funny because he agreed to like, look at it at the 85 percent mark. I didn't even need to get to my 95 and exact random number. Yeah, I feel like 

**Jason:** this is the next big hurdle. Uh, the first part is like the deal sources, [00:40:00] but then negotiations, it's like, I don't know about everybody else, but like, I'm going to start perspiring about negotiating costs.

And, you know, I don't want to come in too low, but you know, I want to make sure that, you know, Like, we're coming up with an amicable solution that, like, satisfies both parties, but, you know, so, I don't know. It's tough. So, yeah, I, I look forward to that call. 

**Athena:** When you do have those opportunities, this is, so, you know, Ryan and the team are amazing, but these calls are perfect for something like that.

If you want to, like, either do a role play or, like, talk. Talk about what you're thinking, and then you get our feedback, but also anyone on the call can feedback too, and just help you feel a little bit more confident in that. So that's a perfect use of like, these calls tell us in the little form, like, hey, we're going to still want to talk through negotiation, like, would love, love to [00:41:00] either role play or get feedback from the group, that sort of thing, because it is like, we all.

Have different levels of negotiating experience and might see different angles and that sort of thing. So I would love for you to bring stuff like that here. 

**Jason:** Oh, I'm ready. 

**Athena:** Awesome. Brian, I bet you might have some. Oh, sorry. Go ahead. Andrew. 

**Andrew:** No, I was just going to add on. I mean, I, I totally get what Jason's saying, too.

I mean, I. A lot of it's just coming, even if you've got have a lot of reps, and if it's been a long time since you've done it frequently, it can be kind of. Intimidating. What helps, what helps me a lot, I think, Jason, if I remember right from one of those calls, you're in sales to, um, engineering. Oh, so I don't, 

**Jason:** I don't deal with people a lot.

So this is where, and I work with a whole bunch of introverts, 

**Andrew:** even when I have to do this. Even more so, man, I, I think it's really helpful. I don't know if Athena agrees that you could cut me off, but I, I, the, the disk assessment, I automatically when I start talking to somebody, I put them in a [00:42:00] category of a D.

I. S. or C. and I talk to them how I know they want to be talked to. If I'm talking to you as an engineer, I can't be my, like, hands talking really exaggerating because you're not going to relate to that. And then sometimes when I'm in a business setting, I automatically go super hard ID where I'm just direct the point.

No, because I want them to respect me when in all actuality, it's not helping the scenario. So it's hard, but I think that helped me because all the Christmas stuff I used to lead script practice where in a former. Job and we would literally go through that. You know, how am I supposed to do that? Go through all those scripts that Chris Voss teaches.

Um, they're kind of uncomfortable and I'm out of practice. So I'm I'm with you, man. It's even if you know how to do it, it's it's it's hard to put into practice practice if you're not doing it every day. 

**Jason:** Yeah, it's like public speaking. Like it's like, once you get some reps and public speaking, it's fine.

But if you haven't done it in like six months, it's nerve wracking. 

**Athena:** Super [00:43:00] nerve wracking. Andrew, I would love like for those that aren't familiar with disc and might watch the replay. Do you feel comfortable since you are one of the master trainers amongst the group? Do you mind, uh, breaking down what disc is?

**Andrew:** Yeah. So there's free assessments everywhere online. I think, uh, uh, Uh, oh, geez, Tony Robbins, Tony Robbins has a free assessment online of the disc. So the high, you know, it's D. I. S. and C. high D. is the very direct people. I'm not going to say I'm going to say as few words per sentence as physically possible.

It's going to come off pretty aggressive. Um, even though they don't mean it that way, they don't want to waste time. Um, they're direct to the point. They're sometimes not the 1, they might talk 1st, and then they're going to kind of sit back and listen to everybody else. And they're, they might be tuning out and being on to the next subject before you're finishing the sentence.

A high I, if someone like me, frankly, like, just kind of will tell you literally everything about their lives. Upon 1st, [00:44:00] meeting you and very, you know, exaggerates things and, you know, talks with their hands and the people person, right? Never meets a stranger type of a person. And s is a smooth and steady is how I think of it.

They don't trust people. Inherently. You have to earn their trust. Think like you're, um. Probably engineering is probably more high asses and see, and I'll get to that very smooth and steady. I only trust like, 5 people and you're not 1 of those people. So I'm not going to tell you anything about my life until you earn that trust.

And the most of the most of the population is a high as it is, like, 70 percent of the population is a high leads with an S, and then has a little bit of eye. I see is like, your accountants, like, if it's not numbers, I can't talk to you. I can't. I'm not going to talk about my emotions, anything more than what, you know, the weather's great today.

How are you? Anything beyond that, you're not going to get it out of me until we get real deep into that [00:45:00] relationship. So, um, traditionally, I feel like a lot of business owners are high Ds because those are what's traditionally associated more with business success because they're super direct, even though that's not always the case.

So I've definitely been on that side of the call where I'm talking more than the seller is and feeling like I should be asking a lot more questions to try to peel back that layer of onion instead of just me talking about things I don't know about yet because I don't know their business. So anyways, but 

**Jason:** that happened to me last week and I was like, I'm going to try not to say a lot because I'm the same thing.

Like if I meet you, like, I'm just going to tell you everything. Yeah. Yeah. So maybe 

**Andrew:** you're, yeah, you're, you're probably unique for the engineering world. Um, but that's. I mean, I automatically label someone as a DISC, not in a judgmental way, but I have to know how to talk to them, especially in a sales. If I'm going to try to close something in the next 30 minutes, I'm going to have to assign you something on that scale.

Plus, it's only four things. It's easy [00:46:00] to remember those. You don't have to go through. 30 checklists of personality assessments to get there. I can put you into a little bit of a box, but then there's like, the camera, what they call it. I don't know if you remember Athena, but there's like, what you lead with naturally.

And then what you put on, like, there's a work version of you and there's like, natural version of you. And those can be very different. Like I said, my, my natural inclination is very open. But sometimes if I'm in a work setting, I want to be direct because I want to seem like I know what I'm talking about.

**Athena:** That's so, uh, like, it's, it's interesting hearing you explain it that way. Um, I think that's really useful for the group too. So thank you for sharing all that. It's interesting because I, I think I naturally am like a D, but I operate as an eye. 

**Andrew:** Yeah, for sure. 

**Athena:** It's like the team knows, like, if I'm just like firing messages to them, it's like, it's little words of possible and it's probably misspelled because I have these talons on my finger, but also I love like [00:47:00] sharing and creating the report, but 20 years of client servicing, it's like, I know that that breaks down barriers a lot easier if I, if I have an eye, you know, and like bring that energy and stuff like that.

So, um, but I'll mirror, uh, Oh, look at that mirror. Mirror what you say, uh, I think 1 of the best things that you do and Jason, maybe that's where you were trying to bring the mirroring and is, is just get a read of, like, where's this person at? So, using desk or anything like. What's the best way that I can communicate on their level and in the way in the style that they like, and you're likely to get a better response from them.

So this is something I talked to the team about. And from a client servicing perspective, it's like, well, we might favor, you know, slack messages, but somebody is better when they're talking through something. So, like, how can we facilitate that to help people through that as well? So you can think about that with your sellers or the people that you're communicating with, like, you know.

Their desk profile, how do they like to communicate and then [00:48:00] just being an affinity to them and making their life easy and making them feel like this is easy. This is good. This feels good. I feel understood. Um, and another thing I'll pick up from what Andrew said, and what you both are talking about is if you ever feel.

Out of your depth or like, it's not going well. Asking questions is one of the best ways to just start breaking down barriers there, you know, like, and not hard hitting questions like the softer questions, you know, like, Hey, I know we're getting in the weeds here, but like, I'm just curious, like, how did you come up with this or like, have you had a hard day?

Like, how do you overcome that? You know, people that talk about like their accomplishments and they'll be your friend in no time. Can I

**Andrew:** ask a quick question that's like a totally not even remotely close to this, Athena? I know we're towards the back end of this. 

Yeah. 

**Andrew:** Ryan and I were talking really about this. [00:49:00] It's not, it might not even be a real opportunity at this point, but something potential that would, that would effectively be more than likely not a full buyout, like a seller retaining a decent to maybe even half of the business.

How does that function as a product of the SBA financing? And can it, what, how can you talk? I know that's probably a large subject. Can you give a brief synopsis of what you like, how you would finance something like that or what the ins and outs are? 

**Athena:** Yeah, briefly. I want to look at the deal 1st, if it's like a 50 percent because that feels like an investment, not a purchase.

Yeah, 

**Andrew:** yeah. 

**Athena:** So that that's a different play than in a different consideration. We just had a conversation with another one of our clients about this. So it might just be the sellers not comfortable for whatever reason, but the new S. O. P. from the S. B. A. allows for partial buyouts. So you can buy part of the business using S.

B. A. The numbers all still need to paper, right? Like, with the amount that you'd be getting, it needs to still be debt service [00:50:00] coverage ratios. Okay. That sort of thing. Okay. Um, I believe, oh, gosh, I'm having like a brain scramble now. It used to be that the seller had to put a PG on it. I believe if they retain more than 20%, they will need to PG your loan.

Um, Ana, can you write that down? That's another one. I've had this answer before and the SOP changed and I had so many conversations. Let me. Double verify, but I'm pretty sure if they retain more than 20, they will take a PG, which is 1 of the negotiating tools you can use to get a below 20. at least if you need to do some sort of, like, um, retaining of equity or rollover.

Yeah, so it's called rollover equity and also the other thing is, you will need to have really great, um, structuring advice. Because there's tax implications there, too, and it might change it from an asset sale to a stock sale under certain circumstances, which also [00:51:00] then there's liability and that sort of thing.

So, um, we'll check on the PG point because it's. Towards the end of the day, my brain starts mixing things up. Sometimes I want to make sure I give you the exact right answer there. Um, and then also 1 of the folks that I want to bring in the new year is kind of an entity master there, but, um, the lawyers that we make introductions to will be able to advise you on that sort of stuff and then it is allowable by SBA, but.

Again, if they're wanting 50%, then that's where I want to, like, kind of dig into a little bit deeper on the motivations there. And like, is this, uh, they're just wary of selling or the deal won't work otherwise. And maybe there's a different way of looking at it, but that feels like an investment versus an acquisition.

**Andrew:** Yeah, and I mean, that that was just to throw it out there for the same. I mean, it'd probably be more, you know, a majority ownership. Um, you know, assuming [00:52:00] early, that's what I would want to do. Um, but, you know, if there's like a, a logical strategic partnership there, you know, that might make sense where they're also, I mean, I would assume that there would be some benefits maybe to to just having a, you know, putting a substantial amount down and kind of closing and having that current owner finance that deal rather than get an S.

B. A. One altogether. Right. 

**Athena:** Uh, yeah, potentially. Um, look,

I have just seen so many would be partnerships. Go. Yeah. Sour. So my personal and this is the lens that I advise you from is my personal preference and my personal experience with partnerships is that You're in control if you buy it completely and keep them on as a consultant under some sort of consulting agreement or whatever.

So that when you take the business over, they don't operate in a different way. Also, if you're buying the business and the current [00:53:00] owner stays, it's really hard for you to create a new culture or make changes or shifts in that way, because everybody's still going to respond to him as the hefe because that's what he's been.

Um, so that's a consideration that I bring into like my thought process around it. Um, and also, like, people just have different work ethics and ways of working and, you know, 99 percent of the time, the issues that I see in businesses are in the business partnership. Right. So you really want to be like, absolutely certain that that owner is somebody that you, you are like, I love this person and I can see myself in business with them forever.

Um, but in circumstances where, like, say a license is required and the owner retains license and you can leave them some rollover equity to essentially keep their license in the business. That's something that's worth considering, but you're just like, this is what I'm giving [00:54:00] you to keep your license in the business, but you're not necessarily going to have an active role.

It's kind of like still like a buyout. So. Um, the short answer to your question was it depends and there's a scenario to consider. 

**Andrew:** I had never thought about it, you know, I mean, I thought about it, but I hadn't thought about from a finance perspective. So, yeah, car before the horse, probably, but worth bringing up.

**Athena:** Yeah, but I love it. Think creatively about how to get a deal done. Right? And then it's like, well, if it's not allowable, that's 1 thing. But just thinking of all the different tools and all the different ways that you can get a deal done is good. So, um, you know, and again, like, I'll, I'll try to disclose when I have a personal preference and just, you know.

I haven't seen a lot of partnerships go well, so by I always lean towards maintain control and get them as a contractor and advisor or something after the fact, or get them bought in with a, you know, seller note, but not necessarily retaining equity because then they get [00:55:00] upside in perpetuity, even though they might not be contributing.

Towards that in the long term. Um, cool. This was awesome. I had a lot of fun today. So we'll get the recap up. We have three things on SBA that we need to clarify. So we'll get the clarifications on those next Tuesday is when the lawyers are going to be joining. So please join for that. So you can ask them all your burning questions and we will have our very own Co created LOI template for you all that we'll be introducing to you too, which is awesome.

So then there will be a template that we love. It sees all the, it has all the things that we like seeing in an LOI in it. So we can, um, show you all how to use that. Uh, they'll be there to, you can ask any and all questions. They're amazing. Um, and then Thursday, Ryan and I are going to talk to you about seller meetings and approaches and strategies and how to get the best out of those too.

So we'd love to see you all there for that. Also, and if you have anything live deals wise that financial modeling or role [00:56:00] plating, we can make time for that. So just drop it in the channel and let us know if you want to bring anything in. You know, bring it to the group and have a conversation on these calls.

We don't want to just be talking at you. We'd love to get you actively involved and get the group involved too. So thanks for your contributions today to Jason and Andrew is really helpful and kind of what we're hoping happens more of. So thank you more of that, please.

**Andrew:** Thank you. Thanks all. Cool. Thank you. See ya. Bye guys. 

**Athena:** Bye.
