Anke Jordaan
Hey, where did you let them in? Hi.

Athena Simpson
Hi. I am feeling really tired. So, like, yeah, I don't know how much we need to go through today, but I would love to get some time back before Buyer's Club.

Anke Jordaan
Sure. Let me just quickly take a stab at the agenda. You wanted to talk about client meetings with the team, and then Cash, looks like Cash added a bunch of questions that he has.

So, but there's no write-ups in the agenda.

Athena Simpson
, okay. Okay, we don't have any write-ups for Justin, do we?

Anke Jordaan
Justin, Luke just messaged me that he's trying to get a write-up ready for him.

Athena Simpson
Okay. All right, let's talk through the, yeah, let's talk through the client meetings. Let's add that tomorrow.

Anke Jordaan
Okay. I'm in the mind.

Athena Simpson
Okay.

Ryan Cash
Hello, hello. Hey, guys.

Athena Simpson
Hello. Hey. All right. Well done, Luke. You smashed the call with Josh earlier.

Luke Gillespie
Thanks. was so fun. Nice.

Charis Siau
I could have easily not been on the call.

Athena Simpson
just put my hair and nails, and he's like, no. Oh, okay. He was saying that like beauty services are emotional buys.

And I was like, do you know women that do their hair and nails? That is a like, essential. Remember, he proposed to his wife when they were backpacking in Yosemite.

So she's not really that. I but like, I don't know. Like, see, I know plenty of women that love nature that still get their hair done.

Luke Gillespie
So like, you know, I'm all kinds of gray.

Athena Simpson
Like, this is not an emotional buy. It's just like, it is, right? It's like eating and breathing. Like, it has to be done.

But I was mentioning that because he was saying like cyclical, emotional, whatever. And like, when we were looking at med spas and talking about that, like with COVID and everything, like the owners were like, oh no, women, like once they start getting this stuff, like they.

They will do whatever, they'll sell, they close off their kids' back to make sure that they're still getting services, you know, so it's like understanding the customer set and whether they view it as an emotional buy or not, you know, I don't have, like, I have to get my nails done, you know, like, it's just a thing that I don't view as something that, like, I will cut spending somewhere else to, like, get my thingies.

So, Luke, I guess that's, you know, and for everybody, like, when you get to that beauty section, that is a very interesting point about those is that they might see it as, like, non-essential, but for some of them, like, if women have started on injectables, your face falls apart if you don't keep getting your Botox.

Luke Gillespie
I don't do that personally. I don't agree with it because of that, because your muscles in your face literally atrophy, so they have to keep getting injected, otherwise their face falls apart.

Wow. Is that permanent? Yeah. have to keep doing it? Yeah, like, this is why it upsets me, because, like, young women are starting to get Botox, and I, like, every time I, like, what happens when you stop using a muscle?

they're like, it atrophies. I was like, so what do you think you're doing to your face? Recurring revenue, though.

Athena Simpson
Well, that's the thing. So it's not, it's not an emotional luxury expense. It's a, it's a necessity. Like, once women get on the injectable train, like, they don't stop.

Otherwise, their face literally, like, like, wow.

Luke Gillespie
Yeah.

Athena Simpson
Wow.

Luke Gillespie
I just love her response on that.

Anke Jordaan
Athena's, like, thinking of health issues, and Luke's just, like, recurring revenue.

Athena Simpson
But that's why I was bringing it up, because I was like, oh, like, most women, I think, get hair or makeup or something done, right?

Like, you get haircuts. Like, that's usually not a emotional lie. It's like, my hair literally, like, wraps up into dreads if I don't get it cut.

You know, at least once a year. It's like, that's not an emotional buy. I have to.

Charis Siau
Yeah.

Luke Gillespie
Charis, you got curls.

Athena Simpson
So you probably got to get like regular cuts. So your hair, I mean, I I've got natural curls too, but, um, it's a pain.

Charis Siau
Curling is its own thing. Oh yeah, exactly.

Athena Simpson
So yeah, it's not, not necessarily being like a girly girl, but yeah, I, I, the, the med spas, if you've got, and the owner that even Eli was under, um, contract with, I believe had subscriptions, which is why it was even more interesting.

You know, like you get that subscription model going for something like that. They can be extremely lucrative businesses with a sticky client base.

They're not, they're not stopping that stuff once they start. Yeah.

Luke Gillespie
Interesting. That could explain the hype behind the med spas.

Athena Simpson
You Yeah, those injectables too are super, that's the biggest cost center. So how somebody manages their inventory on that and the inventory management system that they have, like even a drop can be like $100 or something like that, like based on when I was looking at all those med spas before.

So if they don't control the inventory very closely, that's a huge opportunity to like increase margin significantly just by putting a good inventory system in.

Luke Gillespie
Yeah.

Athena Simpson
Anyways, I will stop ranting about med spas. was meant to say Luke did an amazing job. I didn't even need to be on the call.

I would really like you guys to watch that back. We left off the last two sections because we had kind of gone through that with Josh before, but in terms of how to go through industries and how he was digging in and how he was giving examples and he was picking up on the theme of like what Josh was into and like, oh my God, Josh's nose.

You guys, like the characteristics are like, it's wild. So Luke handled it really well. And you could tell by the end of the call that Josh was like, I trust Luke.

Luke has got me figured out. I trust him. I trust him to challenge me. So it went from, you know, him being like, these are my preferences and dah, dah, dah, dah, dah.

So like, yeah, Luke, you got me. I'm totally open to it. So it was cool to see that, that progression too.

And that's really the point of that call is that they feel like you as their analyst, get them, get where they're going, but also will challenge them on, on things that might, they might not have thought about before.

that could open them up to other possibilities. Something that I was thinking, Luke, that might be a good teaching moment for everybody is like, Josh was using the word challenge.

So you were mirroring that back to him, but we, we talk like about challenging there. I think we could probably think of different language on those calls that is a little bit more positive and collaborative, so they don't get it.

And he was fine with that because he's like, I want to be challenged, but other clients might feel like it can feel confrontational.

So the intention behind your questioning was right, but we all might want to use language on, hey, do you mind if I give you an alternative that maybe you hadn't thought about before?

You know, just like it's the same thing. It's just using different language so they don't feel, because what can happen is people, they don't often voice it, but they feel so self-conscious going through this process because they don't know what they're doing, right?

So they're just grasping onto every book, every podcast, whatever, so that they can sound confident and they know that we know what we're doing, so they don't want to look like an experience.

Or like they don't have their together. They're not going to be a good business owner. So they, in essence, want to also impress us.

So the language that we use, we want it to feel like more collaborative and like brainstorming, you know, like, what's the word I'm thinking about?

You get what I'm saying though? So like you're collaborating with them on some ideas or, hey, have you thought of this?

Or, you know, what's cool about this industry is like, I didn't realize this, but med spas, like those women, you know what I'm saying?

So rather than like, hey, can I challenge your assumption here? So saying something like that might make them think that they have made the wrong assumptions the whole time.

So that's the only point. that like, you were still fine because you were mirroring his language back to him.

But for other clients, and when you guys watch back Luke's video, just be conscious of the person on the receiving end of that.

And you can kind of feel body language, energy, that sort of thing, if they feel like they're on the spot or like, you know, know, that's true.

So they don't want to let us down. They don't want us to think that they don't have a good head on their shoulders and, you know, are good at business analysis and that sort of thing.

So it's a fine line behind like displaying expertise while also giving them confidence at the same time, you know, because what we don't want is them second guessing themselves all the time and slowing themselves down.

So, uh, yeah, but like, he totally, you want him over, like, for sure. I was like, I could leave the call at the break.

And like, he was already like, yeah, you, you understand what I want. Like, I trust you to put things in front of me.

So it was cool. So I want you guys all to watch that. So you can kind of see how Luke was pulling out ideas or examples from other businesses that he'd seen and that sort of thing to kind of paint the picture or open up the deal box, which you did a great job.

Got a lot more openness there. Despite all of his no's. So that's going to be interesting to like write up.

I wrote down like pages and pages of no, no, no, no, no. was just like, we're going to have to get him to pick, you know, the deal breaker ones and like the nice to have ones.

So we want a high performing team. I don't want to deal with consumers. I don't want it commoditized. I agree with.

I don't like commoditized businesses either. I don't want this. I don't want that. I don't want this. I don't want that.

No Karen's like, you know, it's like, holy .

Luke Gillespie
Are there going to be any businesses left?

Athena Simpson
So sometimes you'll have that. And then, and then it's about coaching them through like, well, what, what's a deal breaker versus what's something that you can implement in the business?

Okay. You want a high performing team. What if they just haven't had an owner that was like super strong at that?

And that's your skill set, which it is his skill set. That's what he goes in and does, you know?

So it's like, do you want them to? Would be high-performing or is that something that you can bring your own flavor to it, you know?

Luke Gillespie
Yeah.

Athena Simpson
Anyways, I'm very excited because he was a tough cookie and Luke did a very good job.

Ryan Cash
Thanks, Athena.

Luke Gillespie
Thanks, Cash. Way to go, Luke.

Athena Simpson
Sorry, I touched the agenda. What were you going to say, Luke?

Luke Gillespie
I said, hear you on the language, like, not using pushback and challenge because we could find a less combative way to say that's a smart idea.

Athena Simpson
Yeah. The only other thing I might give you some feedback on is just reading the script rather than going off script and just getting used to the script first.

This is what the top salespeople do. It's what Austin did. He read it verbatim until he could recite it without reading it.

Because what you ended up doing is you brought some of the things forward that you said later, and then you kept calling out that you were repeating yourself.

Throughout that. So it's a little bit, you know, it's like, we can get excited and add some color to it.

But if you just read it through and like read it through to the point where, you know, you guys have seen me, I get on the calls, I don't have a script in front of me.

I just know my, my speaking points because I've done it so many times. So that's a, you know, just a reading a script is not a cheat code.

It's actually what the best of the best do is they keep reading the script until they can say it without reading the script.

Luke Gillespie
Yeah.

Athena Simpson
But you did, this is very fine tooth, whatever, like it was perfectly happy with how it went. So it's just cleaning things up.

And I think you'd like feedback anyway.

Luke Gillespie
So. Yeah. Thanks. Thanks for the feedback.

Athena Simpson
All right, cool. What do we want to talk about? Just FYI, you guys, I'm really low energy today. So I'm going to try to get through the necessities and then find whatever I have left for Buyer's Club.

I'm not like super flat for that. Thank you.

Luke Gillespie
Hopefully we can end early to give you some time for a coffee before buyers close.

Athena Simpson
If not, it's fine. I've got a coffee here. So I'll rally. Usually adrenaline kicks in when I know they're all joining, especially since we've got some new clients.

So I get especially on edge when we don't have clients with a lot of deals going on. So that should hopefully solve itself in the next week or two.

So Okay, Luke, I didn't see you put in the Buyers Club updates that you normally do in the agenda.

Luke Gillespie
No, sorry. didn't write anything down. I just have it in my head to tell Athena.

SCREEN SHARING
Anke started screen sharing
Okay, we'll do that at the end. Thank you, Luke.

Anke Jordaan
Okay, so Buyers Club update. Cash has a couple of questions.

Athena Simpson
Yeah, more of a point.

Ryan Cash
We're trying to get these steel box discovery prompts done 48 hours ahead of the call for you. I have not received Pushkar's questionnaire yet.

And 48 hours would be 10 a.m. tomorrow. And if I'm going to do that, I need to get the questionnaire from him as soon as possible, hopefully by end of today.

I don't know whose yardage that is or who's in charge of that, but that's something that I, if I'm going to get that done, I'm going to need that document.

Anke Jordaan
Yeah, so go ahead, Anke. sorry, Athena. Ida did follow up with Pushkar yesterday to get the form done. She's following up with him today to get it to us by end of day today so that Cash can have that form to get the prep done.

So it's just, it's going to be important. Normally he sends things very, very timely, but Ida did give him the deadline when she sent him the questionnaire last week, just after the session two, session one you guys had.

But just, I just want to clean up the words with. So she says the team needs it for the call on Friday and, you know, any delay in this could delay your search starts, just so he's aware.

Athena Simpson
Have you chased him already, Anke?

Anke Jordaan
Yes, she chased him yesterday. He said he's about 60% through.

Athena Simpson
Okay, cool. And then Cash, in the future, Ida is the one kind of project managing the whole onboarding process.

So if you don't have what you need, you can check in with Ida and see what's going on for status there.

Ryan Cash
Cool. Sounds good. And then next, I just brought this up in a couple different places, but this seemed to be the hour to talk about it.

So just wanted to bring up again a question of how we're thinking about qualifying deals for these first write-ups for clients, given this is one that everyone's going to be a lot more involved in, and it's also a good first impression whenever we're presenting a first deal.

So look that. No. No. I know I'm currently, almost all of my clients were not getting deal flow. So we did a big push, which meant going to more of the fringes.

So getting more deal flow now, but I don't know if any of the deals would be ones that I would say are within the deal boxes that we've talked about up through the onboarding calls.

So, yeah, I guess in general, just trying to get a feel for what our thoughts are on these first write-ups for new clients.

Athena Simpson
So to read between the lines, you feel like nothing that's coming through meets the deal box for clients. Is that correct?

Ryan Cash
Very fringe cases. Like, they're all somewhat gray area. Nothing is like a tried and true, like, yeah, this fits SDE, this fits.

It's geography. This fits like asking price. They're all kind of even like industry gray areas. And some of them like, like, yeah, sure.

We talked to Frederico and kind of got him to change his mind about like looking at CPA businesses, but like, do I really want to put like a first deal being like a CPA business that's doing like 2 million in sales?

That's going to be like more than what he's like approved for is like a first deal in front of him.

It doesn't really feel good to me to do that versus something that like is a little bit closer to what we've talked about up till now.

Athena Simpson
So whatever their prequel is, we double that. And with structuring, we can get them there. So like what's more important is does the number after debt service meet their minimum?

So we don't want to put deal. In front of clients that don't at least meet their minimum income requirements, because that's just kind of a non-starter.

After that, then they have been told, and you've seen the sales calls and reiterated throughout it, that the first two months are a calibration period.

There's going to be gray areas, and we're going to put deals in front of them to stress test those gray areas.

So if you have a gray area deal, then it's just more a matter of positioning. Like, hey, you're early in your search, so we want you to start getting your reps in.

We also want to clarify some of the areas that came up as gray areas for you. No better way than you looking under the hood on a deal.

So I don't think this is 100% near match, but I do need you to start getting your reps in as I look for those needle in the haystacks.

So then it's just a matter of positioning, unless it's an absolute deal-breaker, like client concentration wouldn't be funded by SBA.

Not a good financial match or just a terrible business. It's all cash or there's potentially fraud or things like that.

So what would be more helpful cash is if you brought those to this meeting because my answer is always going to be like, it depends on the deal of the client.

Ryan Cash
Yeah.

Athena Simpson
Does that help though?

Ryan Cash
Yeah. I mean, it seems like the thought is to continue to go for these French cases for first deals.

Athena Simpson
Yeah. So why do you think that is? Because I've kind of, sorry. So one thing that I do with you guys, it's not putting you on the spot.

It's getting you to replay to see how I'm briefing you and where I need to fill in the. So why would we put in a gray area deal in front of someone at this stage?

Ryan Cash
I get the value of wanting to really get them used to understanding where their gray areas are and get them to really understand what their deal box is and how they should be thinking about their deal box.

I get that. I see the value 100% of that. think my only hesitation would be the amount of time that we're going to spend working with them on this one specific deal, making sure that they've got the broker lined up, making sure that they're doing all the diligence on the call.

I'm happy to do that. mean, there's just a lot of these that I personally wouldn't want to put in front of the client.

And maybe that's just me. And if it is, I'm totally fine to just change my thought process on that.

It might be that I'm just being too critical of some of these sins that I'm seeing, but I think it's more just like an internal hesitation of not really seeing the fit for the clients on some of these that I'm getting.

Athena Simpson
Yeah, I got you. So bring those deals here. So I actually have deals that I can work with you on because right now it's just like generalities and it's going to be really tough for me to give you feedback that you can use.

So if you're not sure on a deal, bring the deal here. We can review this in. We can talk about whether it's a good fit.

That's exactly what this call is for. And then the more that we all talk about it, you can start to, you know, sharpen your out.

Perspective there. Luke found this out early on. He was being super, super cutthroat on deals. And then when we got him to ease up a bit, clients ended up getting really excited about deals he never thought that they would have gone for.

But it's not your call to decide whether they're going to like it or not. What we need to do is analyze whether it meets deal box criteria and we'll get them, you know, the financial outcome at a minimum and is within some of the other parameters that you set.

But what do you think the benefit of Frederico preparing for a broker call is that he's not that excited about?

Ryan Cash
I mean, he gets the benefit of the like preparation and getting the rep in and it gives him the benefit of like doing the practice and doing the drill before he needs it.

Like, I definitely see the value of that.

Athena Simpson
We need them to do that. But I can't tell you how many clients lose deals because they don't have the right experience when the right deal comes in front of them.

So they have been sold from day one that the first couple of months are going to be a calibration period where we're calibrating to them.

like, hey, you said you might be interested in accounting. Something's come across my desk. Let's look at it and see how you feel about it.

Because it's different when they're looking at something that's for them rather than theoretically deciding. And it gives them some time to, like, what's worse is to have them sitting there with nothing to do.

Ryan Cash
Sure. And to that. Especially early on, right?

Athena Simpson
So if we manage their expectations that, hey, this isn't a direct hit. We know that. This is part of your practice calibration period.

So I want you to prepare for this broker call. You're not going to be as, it's not going to feel as, like, high intensity because you don't care about it that much.

So even better, right? So it's, like, lower stakes. them if they screw it up.

Ryan Cash
Yeah, totally heard. I get it. I think to that point of not wanting them to be sitting on their hands, I've noticed, again, this is with my clients, just general deal flow is pretty constricted.

But we have a system in place right now where clients aren't having their weekly meetings until after we start presenting deals to them.

But we have a situation where there's clients that we know have really constricted deal boxes right now because we just don't have deal flow for them, like Federico, specifically.

We've done and pulled a lot of triggers to try to increase numbers in San Antonio. I mean, I think what we probably need to do, and I think the process is just to try to...

Open up some additional industries or geography coverage for him, but we're in a situation where we don't have a meeting with him until we put a deal in front of him, but not having a meeting to increase his deal box coverage is also a bottleneck to getting deals in front of him.

Athena Simpson
Yeah, so the reason why we haven't been doing the meetings for them until they have a write-up is because I was the one having the meetings, and I don't have the bandwidth to have 15 client meetings, so I'm happy for you guys to take calls.

I would love for you to take calls. It's unlikely that they're going to change their geography, right? So you also need to remember what we sold then.

Ryan Cash
Yeah, I'm totally, totally fine with that. think most of the issues with constricted industry selection. But I would, I would,

Athena Simpson
So what might be a good idea then, since Luke's got a ton of experience with this, is for the two of you to get on a call and be like, hey, I brought my colleague Luke on.

We want to talk about your industries and see if we can widen a deal box for you because we've now done one of the features that we sell them is when we start a new search, we do a look back and we see what kind of deal flow that they're getting and whether it's going to be restricted for them going forward.

I don't know if we've actually done that. Like, did we get a temperature check from David on all the new clients, Anke?

If not, we need to, right? So that these guys have an idea of what they need to start talking with the clients about for opening deal flow.

Anke Jordaan
Okay, I hear you. When you mean a temperature check, you mean like what David is seeing the deal flow is looking like?

with the start of the search.

Athena Simpson
Yeah, so we're always supposed to do a look back, right? So we see like the last three months of deals, and that gives us a predictor of like what their deal flow is going to look like going forward.

Anke Jordaan
Yes. Okay, yeah. So we, we, we got that and we saw we saw some difficulties with like Cash mentioned.

There's 22 companies in San Antonio over that period.

Athena Simpson
Okay, so we don't just solve this internally, we got to figure out how we're communicating that to the clients too.

Anke Jordaan
Yeah.

Ryan Cash
And I'm totally love the idea of having, you know, myself or whoever pop on with the client to have that conversation.

I think that's obviously an awesome path forward. think that totally. totally. If the Athena bandwidth gets constricted, but if the solution is just having more engagement earlier from us, I'm totally here for it.

Athena Simpson
Yeah, I love that. I would prefer that. The only reason why we've been pushing it off is I just literally do not have the physical space in my calendar to be able to accommodate 15 clients right now.

We were trying to hold back also for you guys to get, because what's going to happen is you're going to get on those calls and they're going to want to know where their deals are at.

That's what I wanted to talk about for tomorrow, right? Like with the client meetings, it's like we have a lot of clients without active deals right now.

And it's pretty uncomfortable to try to like blag it for 45 minutes when they don't have a deal.

Ryan Cash
So, so I was trying to protect you guys from that while you were getting up to speed, but this is a good reason to have a call with Federico.

Athena Simpson
Like, Hey, we've done the look back, which you knew was coming. We told you San Antonio. Because he was flabbergasted that San Antonio wasn't a huge market.

And I told him that, you know, you watched the onboarding calls and I was like, you're going to have a problem, right?

Ryan Cash
So even the timeline with Federico, he was like, I want to do this in like one to three months.

And you were just like, yeah, dude, like, that's not, that's not real. But they're listening to the internet too, you know?

Athena Simpson
So it's like, we're the first ones to tell them the real information as opposed to someone selling them a mastermind that you can buy a business tomorrow with no money and go sit on a beach.

Like that's what the majority of the internet's tell them. So we're the first people. That's why they hire us.

Cause we, we tell it to them straight and we manage their expectations and like, okay, like, here's the thing.

Your deal flow is pretty low, right? It's down to geography. So either we open up geography or you give me like free reign to put industries in front of you to at least get your experience up.

So you're having these conversations while we look for that needle in the haystack of the business that you actually like.

Because when that one comes up, you don't want to have no experience. don't want to have no notches in your bedpost, right?

Like, imagine you find the one after three months and he hasn't had a single broker conversation yet. That's not going to go well.

Um, so with the geography, it's like you can keep it restricted the way the way that you want it, but it's just going to take longer.

So it's not that the deal is not going to come. It's just going to take longer. And I can't guarantee I'm going to put two to four deals in front of you.

So here's an idea. I'm going to put some stuff in front of you. It's calibration. It's not a direct hit, but I need you to get your reps in while we're looking at this and or open up your geography.

Ryan Cash
No, I'm totally here for that. think that makes a lot of sense. I think, um, I, and I'm not worried about Federico, like being open to that.

think, uh, Federico would be open to any suggestion. But I do think what's important is the process and how we do it with clients in general.

And being able to have those conversations sooner, I think, would make everyone's lives better. Yeah, we do.

Athena Simpson
It's just spread out amongst four people instead of one. And again, I was trying to protect you guys from those awkward calls in the meantime.

Um, for the deals that you're not sure about, use this meeting, bring the links, let's talk about them, and then see whether we want to put them forward or not.

Because there, there is a, it's a hard line to kind of figure out. Initially, you have to go wider before you start restricting where, you know, is this like something I think they're not going to like, or is it genuinely a bad business?

lot of times they end up picking up and liking things that you never thought they were going to love.

It's bizarre. It's happened to all of us. So use this meeting to bring the actual deals because it's kind of hard to give you any real useful feedback without that.

Sound good? Cash, that was directed at you. Sorry.

Ryan Cash
Okay. Sorry. didn't know if you're talking to everyone. Yeah, no, I mean, it sounds good to me. Yeah, to everyone, but you were the one that brought it up.

Athena Simpson
Like what deals should we be putting in front of clients initially? So if you have a couple on your plate that you're not sure about, or they're wild cards, like bring the HubSpot links, the SIMs, and we can like review it on this call and go through it and talk through whether we think it's worth putting in front of them or not.

Like either either for... A rep or maybe a potential opportunity.

Luke Gillespie
Speaking of that, Athena, I'm sorry, I forgot about the agenda for this, but I did have a deal I wanted to ask you about.

Athena Simpson
Okay, cool. Let's get through Cash's question and then you can ask yours.

Ryan Cash
I'm good. That's all I brought to the table.

Athena Simpson
Oh, okay, great. Yeah. Luke, what would you like to talk about?

Luke Gillespie
Yeah, yeah. And so Cash, just, you know, like how kind of how we used to do these meetings, since it's new right now, we're dealing with a lot of housekeeping and stuff, but how we used to do these meetings, it would literally just be an hour straight of talking deals, getting Athena's feedback.

So any of these deals you have questions on, just show up to the meeting, you know, as many as you wanted.

There's no dumb questions. There's no too many questions. Just bring it here and Athena will give you feedback. I can teach you whatever I know, the little that I know compared to Athena.

So just feel free to bring every individual deal here.

Athena Simpson
Don't do yourself a disservice. Look, I think you've lived at thousands of Sims by now, so you've got a ton of reps.

Charis also from Southside will have a different view too. So that's why I'm excited about these meetings where we can collaborate and talk.

I don't want you guys feeling like you need to be in a silo for your clients. Obviously, learning their specific criteria and their little quirks is going to be individual to you.

But that's still, you know, I've looked at med spas pretty deeply before and I knew all that random .

You know, like you guys will look at different businesses at different levels and be able to like add that color and perspective.

So that's my favorite thing is to talk deals. So I'm excited for us to get into that again.

Luke Gillespie
All right. Well, speaking of talking deals. So as you know, I've been working tirelessly trying to get a deal for JJ.

I have blocked out every day for my calendar, an hour a day chasing brokers for her. I have this one deal from this broker.

I actually have another lead from this broker, signed fabrication and manufacturing company that does the signs for like. The Cleveland Browns, the Pittsburgh Steelers.

That's an interesting one. I'm going to try to call her tomorrow to get her on the phone for that.

But I was on the phone with her about this deal. It's a tool distributor. The name is Marcus Machinery.

So location, the owner is located in Gibsonia, Pennsylvania. That's like Pittsburgh area. However, all of the sales reps, all the employees that work for the company are all work remotely.

The owner runs it remotely. And there is no warehouse. They drop ship things from the wholesaler to the customer.

And so Jenny marked no to drop shipping. But drop shipping is in that e-commerce section where she's thinking about drop shipping, iPhone cases, and little keychains, right?

But this is like drop shipping. The way the brokers try to be is these 20 ton machines that go on giant trucks, right?

Like the CNC machines, things like that. So do you think this is worth getting in front of Jenny? Because she did say no to drop shipping.

But again, it's not exactly the e-commerce type of dropshipping that she was most likely thinking when she had filled out that form.

Who's the end customer?

Athena Simpson
Oh, sorry, go ahead, Luke. Say that again?

Luke Gillespie
Who's the end customer?

Athena Simpson
Is it businesses or consumers?

Luke Gillespie
Yeah, businesses, whoever's businesses using these machine tools. Got it, okay.

Athena Simpson
Okay, was her preferences in terms of like manufacturing and machinery and that sort of thing?

Luke Gillespie
She's open to it, but we showed her a CNC machine shop before and she wasn't super excited about it.

She's most excited about B2B service businesses, but she's still open to this and her deal flow is so low.

I have so few other options for her and this is why I'm bringing it up.

Athena Simpson
This is another reason why this is going to be awesome to do these calls because I feel like we need to get stuff in front of her, but if she passes on it, this.

It feels like something that might be interesting for Peter. Is it not?

Luke Gillespie
Yeah, yeah, exactly. Exactly.

Athena Simpson
So yeah, like, I think you could probably temp check it with her before you give her the write-up. I don't know if we have a, like, temp check section in the handbook, but something that we have done in the past is, like, when it's something like this, like a wild card, and we're not sure if the client's going to be interested in it, rather than going through the whole write-up process for them, we can say, like, hey, I've got my line of sight on a, you know, remote machine distribution company.

It's a really interesting model. Wasn't sure if that's an interest area for you. Would you like me to put it in front of you?

And just get the clients to say, you know, yes or no on interest area when you're on the fence, because it sounds like we could.

redistribute this deal based on that.

Luke Gillespie
Yeah, you're right. Yep. All right. Jenny is interesting because it feels like she's more interested in like B2B services rather than B2B products.

Yeah. But she just lost a deal that she was under offer and had spent some money on.

Athena Simpson
So we want to get her something else. And her market's been incredibly difficult because it's Ohio. So there's not a whole bunch of inventory as far as like businesses are concerned.

I did tell her and Luke, we should follow up with her to go in her neighborhood and grab the list of all the businesses that she's interested in and send those over to us.

Okay. She also recently put her notice in at her job and is going to be full-time searching. So it puts even more pressure on you.

So she'll hopefully be able to like be on more of the calls, be more active. And I told her to get the list of businesses in her area.

Um, Cash, this is also something that. And we can get the clients to do to get a little bit more involvement from their side is like drive around your area or are there businesses that you've seen that you're interested in?

Give us that list and we'll see if our team can make contact with them.

Ryan Cash
Yeah, I've heard that talked about in a couple just recorded calls that I've seen as well.

Athena Simpson
It's, I mean, we've actually successfully been able to put a deal in front of a client that did that before.

So it's, we can't make any promises, right? It's like, we can't make promises that they're going to be ready to sell or anything, but we can definitely like, from our side, see if we can make contact and get someone to talk about selling.

ACTION ITEM
Follow up w/ Jenny re list of businesses in her area
So Luke, let's follow up with Jenny on that too.

Luke Gillespie
Okay. Sounds good. Cool.

Anke Jordaan
There was actually a deal, uh, that Cash and Luke was talking about in Slack, that they are also, um, One, two,

Swapping clients with. Luke, you want to talk about that while we're on this call?

Luke Gillespie
Yeah, I was just an e-commerce business. Cash came across and he said none of his clients are interested in it.

So I claimed it for DL because they're open to e-commerce and it's big.

Ryan Cash
It was a huge Amazon FBA deal, like 9 million asking price, like FBA deal. And it was through Quiet Light, which at the very least puts super high quality sims together.

Yeah, it's just like it was targeted for Michael, but yeah, that didn't fit Michael's deal box. And it could have also fit Stephen Pauly, but like Pauly clearly said she didn't want to do anything with FBA.

So I just threw it in the chat to see if anyone's clients actually did like FBA. Um, cause You

It seems like even if clients have been open to FBA, it's been like by prying them open to Amazon FBA.

ACTION ITEM
Review Amazon FBA deal for diversified channels pre-DL presentation
So I just put it out in the deal box. Does anyone's clients actually enjoy and want Amazon FBA?

Athena Simpson
So my personal perspective is that we shouldn't be putting FBA businesses in front of clients unless they have diversified channels.

So if it's 100% FBA, that is a single channel risk that I don't think any client can overcome if their Amazon shop gets cut off.

So Luke, I would say Dustin and Lindsay don't have the kind of experience that make me comfortable that they could handle a single channel risk unless it's diversified.

So that's just, and this is where these calls are going to be useful for you guys because you learned my kind of personal preferences around that too.

But for a first time buyer that has no FBA experience, if they're shot. Gets shut down for whatever reason, like overnight, their business is just gone.

Luke Gillespie
Yeah. Yeah. broker.

Ryan Cash
Sorry, I didn't mean to cut you off, Luke. Go ahead.

Luke Gillespie
No, I'm saying, yeah, I always look out for that, Athena. I haven't reviewed this yet, but yeah, I'm going to take a look.

Athena Simpson
Yeah, but if it's 100% FBA, then I need to sign it off, like as to why it's such an exceptional reason that we're putting it in front of clients.

Because single channel risk, 90% customer concentration, those sorts of things, like that's kind of one of those I want to see it and sign it off.

Like usually those are deal breakers. We won't be able to get them financed. It's also putting our clients at pretty exceptional risk if they don't have that exact direct experience.

So we just also want to make sure that we're not putting something in front of them that, yeah, anyways.

I don't need to beat a dead horse. Cool. Anything else?

Ryan Cash
Yeah. Hey, Athena, when brokers are coming with their own SBA pre-qualification, is it more than likely that they're wanting to push that bank?

I understand that most brokers are incentivized with certain SBA lenders to get referral fees and whatnot. I came across a sim that within the SBA pre-qualification, it's got some pretty crazy terms in it, like wanting 50% down on the business and stuff like that.

Athena Simpson
That will be because the broker is trying to get an asking price. It's probably not reasonable. To answer your earlier question...

We like seeing SBA pre-qualifications on businesses because it means that there's pre-qualification of the buyer, and then there's pre-qualification of the business.

The business really is what the SBA will underwrite the most, but they're also looking at the buyer. So we come with the buyer pre-qualification.

If the broker comes with an SBA pre-qualification, that's awesome because it means that lenders have looked at both the business and the buyer, and the likelihood to get financing on it is high.

When you see an SBA pre-qualification like that, where it's required for the buyer to put 50% down to match the asking price, that means that they're probably asking an asking price that is way too high.

Or the lender is conservative or whatever. So you can flag that for somebody. I don't really pay attention to that.

Like SBA will finance it up to a certain amount. So if we reduce the price by a... to get the down payment to 10%, then that's probably what the asking price should be.

Sounds like maybe the multiple was pretty high on that one.

Ryan Cash
Yeah, I believe that's exactly what they cite. Could I share the prequel document here?

Athena Simpson
Sure, yeah.

SCREEN SHARING
Ryan started screen sharing
Because that was the last deal that I looked at. I'd request approval to share screen. So it did also have multiple options, like, I guess, that are maybe pre-approved through the same bank.

It might be in the sim rather than the SBA prequel. But I thought it was actually in the sheet.

Athena Simpson
Maybe it's not. Well, what- What was the SDE?

Ryan Cash
The SDE? Yeah, it's around 600.

Athena Simpson
Interesting. Actually, I don't know why. Oh, okay. So that would be why. So if the SDE is 240 and the asking is...

Luke Gillespie
No, Athena, 240 is the post-debt service SDE for the buyer, 580 is the pre-debt service SDE.

Athena Simpson
Oh, okay. So that's an interesting one then. And that looks like a lending broker, not a direct lender. So that would be one that I'd just like note down as a question for your broker call.

ACTION ITEM
Ask broker re high equity injection req in SBA pre-qual for Amazon seller agency
Yeah. Yeah. Like, it's less than a three multiple. So what's going on there? Oh, wait, four something multiple. So I would be asking the broker, like, what's up with the pre-qual?

Why does the buyer need to come with 45% to 50% down?

Luke Gillespie
Yeah.

Ryan Cash
Yeah. Okay. No, cool.

Athena Simpson
Unless the total, no, they're saying, yeah, 2.2 million. That's about a four multiple. So what's going on there? So that's just something to note down for your broker call.

And then to answer your second question, yeah, the broker is always going to want the buyer to use their SBA lender.

They get 1% as a referral fee of the total loan size. So in this case, it's an extra $10,000 or whatever if the buyer uses the lenders.

So we just coach the clients to be like, yeah, of course, I'll give your lender a look after LOI, right?

So we kind of keep them on the hook like, yeah, I'm planning on speaking to a couple lenders, happy to speak to yours so that they don't think they're going to be cut out necessarily of a fee.

But I've seen it happen multiple times. Gil actually lost a deal. He was under offer because he did the whole process with the broker's lender.

And then broker used that lender's term sheet against Gil when all the other lenders were throwing out ad backs.

So it just puts our clients at a disadvantage. But so there's like a game to be played of like, yeah, of course, I'm happy to consider your lender after we get under offer.

So once they're under offer, then it's like they don't have to, right? Okay, broker canceling the deal because you're not using their lender would be a little ridiculous.

But I do know that they will select buyers based on who they think they're going to get the lender referral fee from.

Many, one of the many reasons I dislike the brokering industry.

Ryan Cash
Yeah, that's super helpful. I'll go ahead and get clarity on a broker call then with that one. I don't know.

It was just weird. I definitely haven't seen a structure broken up like that before.

Athena Simpson
You mean the equity injection or just how they did the prequel?

Ryan Cash
How they did the prequel with the equity injection at that high of percentage with how the multiple actually looks on paper was just weird to me.

Which made me question like, is this just the broker trying? to structure this in a way that's advantageous to them, or is there something actually deeper going on here that I'm just not seeing?

Athena Simpson
Yeah, that's where we always get on a call, right? If the deal looks good otherwise, and it's just like, why is it 40%, 50% equity?

Then I would jump on the call with a broker and be like, what's going on there? There might be some risk that the lender saw that that's what they were personally.

But like every lender is completely different too. So those are the kinds of things when you're reviewing, flag it, write it down, jump on the broker call, ask about it, and then see if they give you an answer that makes you comfortable enough to put it forward from there.

Obviously, it's our client's job to negotiate, purchase price, get their own terms, that sort of thing. So if the asking isn't completely out of line with reality, then they can negotiate it down.

We don't not put it in front of them because of a pre-claw, unless there's... Something in, you know, that to me indicates there's a problem with it somewhere that the lender saw.

Ryan Cash
No, like, totally makes sense. It is an interesting business, too. They actually, they're actually an agency serving Amazon sellers.

So it is a face value. It's a service agency. Their clients are selling products on Amazon. They provide turnkey solutions to basically take most of that process out of their hands.

Athena Simpson
I think we got to get, I need my virus club update and I need to go to the bathroom before the next call.

So feel free to, like, post things in the channel, too. And Luke can give you a lot of, like, insight and stuff like that.

So lean on Luke for you guys to maybe have little chats in between our calls, too. Um, and then Luke, if you could give me a quick update and then I need a, like at least two minutes before the next call.

Luke Gillespie
Yes. Quick update. So DL, uh, got a, the last ride, they got a new write-up. It's a car rental and also car dealership business.

And then I actually have another write-up for DL ready. I'm just waiting to hand it over after they signed their NDA.

They lost the one we liked for them because they waited too long, didn't they? I know they were so slow.

were so slow. Dustin actually got like emotional too.

Athena Simpson
When I was like, they've been back for a week and you guys haven't like gotten in touch with them.

And he was like, like walked off camera for a bit. It was like, oh, I didn't do that before.

It was upset. And then turns out they lost the business. So like they definitely were being incorporated in those two.

Yeah.

Luke Gillespie
They got to learn the hard way. Hopefully that'll encourage them to move faster on the next one. But yeah, so they got that new write-up.

I have another write-up for them. I'm just waiting. We're to get in front of them after they signed the NDA.

Steve and Polly had got that digital marketing write-up for a digital marketing business. They did the call with the broker.

They're waiting to meet with the seller. They may have already met with the seller, but I believe they're just waiting to schedule a meeting with the seller.

We have a write-up in the pipeline for SP that we're waiting to get out. It just hasn't been finalized yet.

Then we also have a write-up for M&M that's waiting to get out. It just hasn't been finalized yet.

Athena Simpson
Sorry, pause real quick. Do we have any update on the smart home business for SP? We haven't gotten updates from them.

Luke Gillespie
No, not that I've seen. Someone interrupt me if I'm wrong, but I also haven't checked Slack all day. I've been in calls all day so far.

Athena Simpson
But yeah, no update on Hive. No. Okay.

Luke Gillespie
They should have submitted their IOI, and we were waiting to get access to the seller is where we left off.

Athena Simpson
Right. Yep.

Luke Gillespie
Okay, carry on.

Athena Simpson
Sorry.

Luke Gillespie
Okay. And then as for the usual suspects in Buyers Club, Gil doesn't have a new write-up for him. And then...

Okay. The deal that he requested from us, I've been chasing forever. I finally have a call with the broker tomorrow, so hopefully I'll be able to turn that one into a write-up, but no new write-ups right now.

But he has that LOI out with the Falcon trading systems. You've been talking to him over Slack, getting the updates on that, so you know where that stands.

As far as JG, also I was chasing deals for him to try to get a write-up. I don't have a write-up right now, although I have a couple calls scheduled this week.

Yeah, then I have some deals I'm chasing for him, but I don't have any new write-ups for JG as of now.

And then as far as the new clients, yeah, we just have MN that we have a write-up ready for, and then the others we're still searching for.

ACTION ITEM
Provide Athena w/ MNF write-up link
And PJ, we haven't had a lot of movement on that. I know the team's flagging that as a deal flow problem that they're talking about.

But again, I missed the daily stand-up this morning, so maybe there's some updates that I'm missing here.

Athena Simpson
Okay, when are you planning on getting me the link for MNF?

Luke Gillespie
Oh, I was going to do it today, but since we had calls with JG and JJ, I was planning on trying to get write-ups for them, but I think I could do that today.

I could have it finished today.

Athena Simpson
No, that's fine. For the meetings, it's really tough to do these weekly meetings without a write-up to talk about.

And it is emotionally very stressful for me, too, because I feel like I have to make up and try to entertain them and all these things.

So Wednesdays are always a hard day for me if there's no new deals on the board. So focus on that.

Yeah, that's what I was trying to do. Yeah, so for all new clients, you included, Luke, I want to just have a look at the first write-up and just check the matching and that sort of thing and talk it through.

And I think it's good learning opportunities for these two also.

Luke Gillespie
Let's see how we're, how you approach first write-ups. Uh-huh. Sounds good.

Ryan Cash
SP did mention that they were talking, they were, they reached out to the broker on the last deal that you submitted them, though, Luke.

So there is that. Other than Hive, they are reaching out to that other deal as well. Yeah, that was the digital marketing company I told you about, Athena.

Luke Gillespie
They did the broker call. They're moving forward to an owner call.

Athena Simpson
Okay, awesome. Good stuff. Okay. What am I going to talk about? Because we've got the new clients on this call, too, so it's not awesome.

There's not a lot of deals to talk through. So hopefully I can fill the time with Steve and Bonnie and Gil.

ACTION ITEM
Collab w/ Ryan on Peter's deal progress update for Thu Athena call
Peter also, Cash, I'm going to need to get an update on, like, maybe you and Luke, Luke can collab on like, he's been spinning his wheels on a lot of the deals we put in front of him.

And I don't feel like he's moved forward on many. So in prep for our call on Thursday, Luke, can you and Ryan just tag team like getting ready for that.

And so we can kind of see what we need to push him on for those. lost track of, you know, which ones he was moving forward.

It sounds like he lost one too.

Luke Gillespie
Yeah. Cool.

Athena Simpson
Good stuff. August says you guys are making really good progress. So I know this is a temporary discomfort of low deal flow, but just know the sooner we can get right up south for the clients, the sooner I can stop having a heart attack.

Um, so I'd rather get them working on stuff. It's not like, if it's not fraud, if it's not, you know, totally like horrible things, like, especially in the new ones, like getting, getting their, teeth into something also gives us learning opportunities to talk about like on the virus club calls, it's just

Kind of a high visibility thing to be bringing clients on and not having stuff for them to work through.

So, yeah, cool. Good stuff. Okay, I gotta go to the bathroom. I'll see you guys, like, now. Thank you.

Bye.
