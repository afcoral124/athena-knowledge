# Seller Mindset - Context & Process

## Knowing the Seller’s Journey

Before jumping into the steps, it’s important to understand the mindset of the seller and the process they’ve been through. Most sellers are navigating a significant life decision, often with limited prior experience. Here’s what you should know:

- **Valuation is often subjective:** Many sellers don’t have a firm grasp on their business’s true value. They may have only recently consulted a broker or decided on a number based on emotion or advice.
- **Their price isn’t set in stone:** Brokers often suggest listing prices to attract sellers, which may not align with financial realities. Expect some “salesmanship” in the numbers.
- **This is their baby:** For many sellers, their business is deeply personal. Critiques of operations or finances can feel like critiques of their life’s work. Build trust and rapport before addressing sensitive topics.
- **Risk aversion:** Sellers may feel they are risking their retirement or legacy on someone they don’t know well. Take the time to build goodwill so they feel comfortable discussing terms like seller financing.

**Your strategy:** Approach each interaction with empathy, understanding their perspective. Build rapport first, earn their trust, and then gradually introduce the tougher conversations.

1. **Don’t talk about moving in together on the first date:** Just as you wouldn’t immediately discuss how to split chores or decorate your future home when you’re getting to know someone, avoid diving into sensitive topics like operational critiques or seller financing too early. Focus on building trust and rapport first—those bigger conversations will come when the relationship is stronger.
2. **Show them you’re worth the compromise:** Sellers will be more open to negotiating terms if they trust and like you. Build rapport before introducing tough conversations.
3. **Play the long game:** You’re not just buying a business—you’re buying into a relationship. Respect the seller’s pace while keeping your strategy on track. Explore what the seller values most in a buyer (e.g., cultural fit, legacy, price).

## The Relationship Analogy: A Strategic Approach

Buying a business is like dating with the goal of marriage. Each stage helps you determine compatibility and build a foundation for a successful partnership. Relationships don’t follow a rigid path, and neither does this process. Use this guide flexibly, combining or skipping steps as needed based on the situation.

**Key Considerations:**

- **Adjust to circumstances:** Competitive situations or limited broker involvement may require you to accelerate steps or combine them.
- **Build rapport at every step:** Sellers need to like, trust, and want to work with you before discussing tough topics.
- **Picture your life together:** Early in the process, focus on whether you can see yourself running this business. The financial and operational details come later.

## Step 1: Warm and Fuzzy

**Dating Step:** Screening & Rapport-Building

**Outcome:** Mutually decide if you like each other enough to move forward.

**Focus on Rapport-Building:**

- Share your story and vision as a potential buyer.
- Learn the seller’s backstory and how the business began.
- Explore their motivations for selling and what excites them about the future.
- Discuss their timeline and post-sale goals.

**Dating Analogy Tip:** Think of this as a casual first coffee date. You’re gauging chemistry and establishing a connection.

## Step 2: Getting More Serious

**Dating Step:** Look Under the Hood

**Outcome:** Begin uncovering the details that will shape your understanding of the business.

**Focus on Key Topics:**

- Review financials at a high level and identify areas for clarification.
- Understand the operational landscape (e.g., team dynamics, processes).
- Begin modeling potential deal ranges to shape your thinking.
- Ask yourself: **Can I see myself in this business?**

**Dating Analogy Tip:** This step is like having deeper conversations about values and future goals in a relationship. It’s less about specifics and more about alignment.

## Step 3: Start Talking Terms (In Person, If Possible)

**Dating Step:** First Serious Conversation

**Outcome:** Begin aligning on deal terms, shared goals, and what the sale might look like.

**Focus on Key Topics:**

- Discuss financials in detail
- Make sure you have what you need to submit LOI
- Discuss the seller’s financial expectations (e.g., rough price range, seller financing).
- Start discussing potential deal structure and timeline.
- Clarify shared goals and vision for the transition.
- Ask about site visit

**Dating Analogy Tip:** Like a meaningful date where you discuss the future, this step sets the foundation for alignment. Meeting in person is ideal for establishing trust and exploring deeper compatibility.

**Fun Tip:** Use this moment to build on earlier conversations. Reference something personal the seller shared to reinforce connection and show you’ve been listening.

## Step 4: Visit Their House (Bonus or as a Standalone)

**Dating Step:** A Visit to the Business

**Outcome:** Observe the business environment firsthand and build trust through face-to-face interaction.

**Focus on Observation:**

- Tour the facility or location, if feasible, to get a sense of operations.
- Note how employees and customers interact without disrupting their workflow.
- Use this as an opportunity to ask high-level questions while respecting boundaries.

**Dating Analogy Tip:** Visiting their house gives you a glimpse into their daily life. Be a polite guest—observe, ask thoughtful questions, and avoid probing too deeply.

**Fun Tip:** Think of this as meeting their “family” for the first time. It’s your chance to see if their world aligns with yours.

## Step 5: Sneaky Stalker

**Dating Step:** Secret Shop or Online Stalking

**Outcome:** Independently gather insights about the business without involving the seller.

**Focus on Observation:**

- Experience the business as a customer or client to get an authentic feel.
- Research online reviews, social media activity, and market reputation.
- Pay attention to customer service, branding, and overall operations from an outsider's perspective.

**Dating Analogy Tip:** A little light “stalking” helps you get candid insights and understand how others perceive the business. Ensure you don’t break NDAs or alert employees about your intentions.

## Step 6: Picking Out a Ring

**Dating Step:** Pre-LOI Preparation

**Outcome:** Build your proposal by modeling potential deal terms and consulting advisors.

**Focus on Preparation:**

- Conduct thorough financial modeling to determine a viable offer.
- Consult with lenders to gauge financing options and deal structure.
- Speak with a lawyer to review your draft LOI and identify any potential risks.

**Dating Analogy Tip:** Before you propose, you need to make sure the ring fits! Take the time to prepare a solid plan to set both you and the seller up for success.

## Step 7: Start Picturing Your Life Together

**Dating Step:** Adventure Date (Ride-Along or In-Depth Meeting)

**Outcome:** Dive deeper into the business and operational realities.

**Focus on Operational Insights:**

- Shadow or observe key aspects of daily operations.
- Meet team members and discuss cultural fit.
- Begin outlining transition plans with their input.

**Dating Analogy Tip:** Ideally, this would happen before the LOI, but only if you’ve built enough trust with the seller to gain access without spooking them. Otherwise, it can be revisited during due diligence.

## Step 8: Decide You Want to Get Serious

**Dating Step:** Proposal (Mutually Agree Terms & Sign LOI)

**Outcome:** Formalize the relationship with clear commitments.

**Focus on Major Deal Points:**

- Outline your offer and discuss key terms (e.g., price, structure, and contingencies).
- Talk about the exclusivity period and set expectations for next steps.
- Discuss their willingness to collaborate during due diligence.

**Dating Analogy Tip:** This is your engagement! Show confidence and commitment while ensuring you’re both aligned on the future.

## Step 9: Background Check

**Dating Step:** Due Diligence

**Outcome:** Verify all assumptions and identify deal breakers.

**Focus on the Details:**

- Perform a financial deep dive, including cash flow, working capital, and tax records.
- Evaluate operational risks, legal compliance, and customer relationships.
- Document findings to guide final negotiations.

**Dating Analogy Tip:** This is where you go beyond trust and verify everything. Stay professional and thorough without overloading the seller.

## Step 10: Pre-Nup & Wedding Planning

**Dating Step:** Final Negotiations

**Outcome:** Address due diligence findings and finalize the Purchase Agreement terms.

**Focus on Adjustments:**

- Negotiate final pricing and terms based on due diligence findings.
- Confirm the transition plan and seller’s post-sale involvement.
- Lock in the closing timeline and milestones.

**Dating Analogy Tip:** It’s time to iron out the details and ensure there are no surprises. Keep the seller engaged and aligned as you finalize everything.

## Step 11: Get Married

**Dating Step:** Closing the Deal

**Outcome:** Sign the Purchase Agreement and begin your new chapter.

**Focus on Finalizing:**

- Execute all legal and financial formalities.
- Transition employees and customers.
- Celebrate the milestone, but stay focused on integration.

**Dating Analogy Tip:** It’s the wedding day! Celebrate your success, but remember the real work begins post-closing.
