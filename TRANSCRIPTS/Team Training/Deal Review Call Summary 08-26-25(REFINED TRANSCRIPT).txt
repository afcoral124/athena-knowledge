1:40 - Athena Simpson
  Amazing. Cool. What have we got on deck today?
  SCREEN SHARING: Anke started screen sharing - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/390417336?timestamp=118.968905

1:53 - Anke Jordaan
  Okay. Okay. Let me share my screen. We can. Okay. go through the agenda. I've got a couple of things. I just want to talk about peer review. I have a question for Charis on Gil. Athena, this was left over from last time. That's why I put it up in here. I mean, both of these two items were left from the agenda from last time. Cash has a question about an asset heavy business. You have an update on JG, PJ. Charis has a good deal. She wants to. And then the team put in your Buyers Club update. So we'll make sure to leave some time at the end so we can quickly go through that and you'll be equipped for Buyers Club.

2:43 - Athena Simpson
  We're good.

2:45 - Anke Jordaan
  Okay. So first thing is peer review on the deal review agenda. So you guys will see that I added on the write ups, I added a section that says reviewed by so you can just  Just add your name and it'll be cool to see who reviewed it. But guys, we really want everybody to review each other's write-ups.  Luke, so I did see two write-ups go out yesterday to Morgan and DL, I think. So those write-ups need to be reviewed by the entire team.  So all three analysts' write-ups are being reviewed by each other. We're doing a peer-review system where we're going to see, you know, sharing knowledge with it between the three of you.

3:35 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah, my bad. I forgot about that. I saw Cash sent his today. was going to review it. So yeah, sounds good.

3:43 - Anke Jordaan
  Okay, perfect. I'll send a short clip for you guys to show where I put the reviewed by thing. So it's going to be cool.  You can see who submitted the write-up and who reviewed the write-up. That's why it's on it. So anybody have any questions on the peer review that we're going to do for the write-ups or is it?
  ACTION ITEM: Slack Gil for written confirmation on passing Falcon deal; repurpose for another client if confirmed
 - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/390417336?timestamp=241.9999  Is it all clear? Okay. Perfect. Charis, just wanted to ask a quick question for you. Last time we spoke, you were going to ask Gil if he officially passed on Falcon.  So we have written confirmation that he did pass on it before we can repurpose that for another client.

4:24 - Charis Siau
  Uh, yeah, I was going to ask Gil on our weekly about that. Um, but I can go ahead and just Slack him if, if you'd rather me do that.

4:37 - Anke Jordaan
  Yeah, I think written confirmation is good. Um, and also, you know, if it's an on-market, you know, on-market deals move, move extremely fast.  So if it's a deal that can be repurposed for another client, we should be moving on it pretty quickly.  Um, to make sure that our clients have the best competitive advantage on these deals.

4:56 - Charis Siau
  Yeah, no, I, I actually forgot we did one. Written confirmation. Yeah, that's right. Okay. I will send him a message, I guess, after Buyers Club.  End of today.

5:16 - Anke Jordaan
  Yeah, and then just let us know. So I'm not sure to who that deal can get repurposed to. And don't remember the conversation he had last time.

5:24 - Charis Siau
  I think Cash for Stephen Pauly, if I remember correctly. Yeah.

5:29 - Athena Simpson
  Okay.

5:31 - Anke Jordaan
  Okay. Okay. Did you want to talk through these or do want me to throw it down below in the agenda?

5:39 - Athena Simpson
  Real estate is a longer conversation. So we need to probably just find a carve out session for us to go through that.  Because I want to make sure we also have time to go through everything on these calls about deals. And then the why this biz, I keep meaning to bring this up.  I feel like I've fed it back in random places. I just wanted to, like, give everybody the same info.  Yeah. I think you all know this already, but like the why this is section on the write-ups should be written to the client as to why we think the business is for them specifically.  So the why we like it section is like business characteristics, et cetera, et cetera, but the why this business, you should be writing it to the client.  So like, you know, Steve, we know you're into trading, so we thought this was really interesting because it's a business directly for traders, et cetera.  So Luke, I wanted to make sure you've heard that because it felt like the why this business was airing a little bit off track there.  So I want to make sure everybody was working off the same assumptions in the sections of the write-up. Any questions on that?  I think I gave this all feedback to you guys individually. I just want to make sure I said it to everyone all at once.  Cool. And then second person. So like speaking to the client directly rather than speaking about them in third person is another thing.  I want to make sure that we're all doing. Thank Good. Okay, cool. So before we dive into your individual things, also just wanted to say it sounds like all the first write-up calls went really  well.  And it sounds like it's a real great value add to our clients to do something like that, which we haven't been doing before.  So, you know, Anke said all of them went really well. Clients were really happy with that. Seems like a really good process.  So even though it is another process and another step, it sounds like it's a really good one to add value, develop that relationship with them, and make the most of those write-ups rather than just kicking over write-ups and then throwing them back.  So good job. All you guys did a great job on that. Sounds like it's going to be a really nice thing going forward too.  Okay, cool. Everybody's silent. All right. What's going on? Mood feels low today. How are we feeling?

8:00 - Luke Gillespie
  We're feeling good. We're feeling good. Just what, Luke? Oh, no. I was just expecting you to take the conversation from there.  So, because we listened to what you said, my bad. should have responded.

8:19 - Athena Simpson
  Charis Ryan, Cash Ryan, I'm like reading your name. How are you feeling?

8:25 - Ryan Cash
  Yeah, feeling good. Just excited to keep trucking along and start getting some reports out this week.

8:33 - Athena Simpson
  Yeah, nice. Everything's going good.

8:36 - Ryan Cash
  Good.

8:37 - Athena Simpson
  You guys feeling more settled?

8:41 - Ryan Cash
  Yeah, it's definitely a lot more good to get more into like the day-to-day flow a little bit. Like definitely have moved from having a lot of training meetings on the calendar to having time to do some more broker calls.  Actually put some write-ups and get the client content out. So, yeah, things are starting to get a little bit more streamlined, which is nice.

9:08 - Athena Simpson
  Sweet. How about you, Charis?

9:11 - Charis Siau
  Yeah, feeling good. Just, you know, going through the motions and definitely getting more settled, you know, having more open space to, you know, work on our write-ups and give our clients the deliverables.  Yeah, feeling good. Okay, good.

9:31 - Athena Simpson
  Awesome. Sorry, we should have done the check-in in the beginning rather than just starting. Which is good. So we're moving into the norming phase from the storming phase, which is awesome to see.  All right, cool. Cash, do you want to talk through your stuff?

9:50 - Ryan Cash
  Yeah, this is just more of a continuation of you and I discussed this trucking company in Florida. And there was a lot of nuances to that with being how asset heavy it was.  Now I'm looking at another asset heavy company that's a dumpster roll-off company that's also in Florida. And it's equally as complex.  It's got two different companies. it doesn't have four this time. It has two. But it is still really asset heavy.  And I just wanted to make sure I actually just got off the broker call before this. But... Yeah. I just know there's a lot more nuances whenever there's just so much more asset-heavy stuff.  And we talked about depreciation being an important thing, but we're making sure that all this depreciation expense isn't actually just normal CapEx and trying to understand what the normal CapEx of the business actually is.  But we kind of went through that in a flurry, and I just wanted to take a moment, and if we have the availability, kind of do a bit of a deeper dive on what it's like to look at an asset-heavy business and what are the important and nuanced considerations that we need to have whenever discussing that.

11:14 - Athena Simpson
  Yeah, good call-out.

11:16 - Ryan Cash
  Really broad question, and I don't know what I don't know. So any kind of way that you think would be good to approach that?

11:24 - Athena Simpson
  Yeah, I'm curious, Charis and Luke, what's your comfort level with these super asset-heavy businesses and CapEx and... How businesses get valued?  Or would that be beneficial to do a session on this? do either of you feel like you've got a good handle on it and maybe you could do some peer learning also?

11:48 - Luke Gillespie
  I mean, I think I mostly understand it and I get Cash's question. I mean, the answer to most questions like that is just going to be, it depends on a deal by deal basis, deal by deal basis, me, right?  How many assets are transferring? What's the nature of the business? So for example, that last one with four, four entities, that's a little bit complex and convoluted, but this business only having two entities, that's much more doable than taking over four entities.  It's really important just to understand the reasoning behind why there is two different entities and why it isn't all wrapped up into one entity.  That's always good to know. Then as far as how asset heavy the business is or not, like I said, I think that just depends on a deal by deal basis.  As long as the numbers still work, it could still be a good fit. But yeah. Obviously, Athena, you mentioned CapEx.  CapEx-heavy businesses are super attractive to really most people just because.

12:43 - Athena Simpson
  Luke, rather than diving into the analysis of the deals, I guess my question is more like how capable do you feel?  Like what is your comfort level with being able to explain CapEx assets, et cetera, to a client? Or do we as a team need to do more of a deep dive in that?  Do you deeply understand it or how to value that and that sort of thing?

13:11 - Luke Gillespie
  Oh, I understand. And, you know, I'm confident and comfortable with those topics.

13:16 - Athena Simpson
  Charis, what's your familiarity level with asset-heavy businesses?

13:21 - Charis Siau
  Yeah, on the sell side, like, you know, I've definitely been a part of CapEx deals, heavy asset deals. But on the buy side, like, you know.  able to... I Anything to do with creative structuring around it, I would definitely say I could benefit from more learning and exposure, and especially talking to, you know, like first-time buyers in the space.  I think I could definitely benefit from learning more on it.

13:57 - Ryan Cash
  I think probably one of my main concerns is just like a lot of these heavy asset businesses operate on a bit more thin margins.  It's just the nature of the industries, and it's like when you have that lower room to like have wiggle room, like the details become just so much more important in terms of like what is being added back, like do I need to, like I really just need to understand it a lot more, like, and it seems like these brokers of these asset-heavy businesses are just also sending over a lot more detailed information where it's like, this broker sent me like a 3,000-line P&L.  It definitely requires a little bit more working knowledge than I have to be able to take an educated stab at what's actually going on here.

14:59 - Athena Simpson
  Okay, so 3,000-line P&L is pretty exceptional. I've not heard of that one before, so you keep pulling the wild cards on these deals.  I think first and foremost, just to not hold up the process, is whatever they're asking, like the asking price and the SDE that they're calculating, first and foremost, need to work, right?  Yeah. Yeah. Thank you. To the purchase price, right? Like pulling the multiple up considerably. But as you will recall from like the Eric Boyce conversation, you know, creating a valuation for a business, if those assets are being used to generate revenue, then they are part of the business.  So that's usually the thing that we see the most is that they'll say, oh, it's a multiple of SDE plus.  You buy all the assets, which, you know, like normally the numbers won't work that way. So we just need to see how far it is from there.  And then in terms of CapEx, I think that the question you can ask the broker or try to discern from the numbers is what kind of investment needs to be made into the equipment on an annual basis to keep the business running?

16:28 - Ryan Cash
  Yeah, that's a much better way to ask that. Definitely understood. Thank you. Concept, trying to get to that, but being able to phrase it like that would have guided it in a more direction that I was trying to get at, for sure.

16:47 - Athena Simpson
  Honestly, like a lot of the brokers don't understand CapEx either. They don't understand the financial statements. So like I find asking questions in plain English rather than like whatever the jargon is, often we'll get a better response from the broker or the seller because they might not understand.  Those either, but with the asset business, if they buy more dumpsters, it's not going to come off the P&L.  So then we're not getting a true reflection of cashflow because it comes up, it's considered an investment in the business, therefore an asset.  So it goes on the balance sheet. So if there, there's a difference also between like maintenance CapEx and growth CapEx.  So if they just want to maintain the business, that's called maintenance CapEx. So once they buy all these, like all these dumpsters are bought, for example, what kind of maintenance is needed on those assets on an annual basis?  I'm assuming there's not a whole ton of upkeep on dumpsters, but where that would be an obvious thing is like on a trucking business, you need to maintain those assets, right?  There's probably like, you know, oil changes and servicing and new tires and blah, blah, blah, like maintaining those assets.  Sometimes it'll hit the P&L, sometimes it won't. Or, you know, the useful life of an asset like a truck is however many years.  So how often are they having to replace that? Another example of that is car washes, you know, like how often are they having to replace the washing equipment?  Like for those like automatic ones that aren't tunnels, it's every five years. So then it's like, well, when was the last time that was replaced, right?  So then it's like, oh, it was brand new equipment five years ago. So the new buyer doesn't realize they're about to be hit with a $250,000 CapEx investment the next year.  So when you see assets, I think it's just, you know, exploring what are they, what's needed to maintain them, how long did they last, right?  Like is the new owner, is the owner selling because they know there's a whole bunch of replacements coming, right?  Which is a big cash outflow. And then do the numbers on the deal work with what they're asking and what the SDE is?  Like, does it blow the debt service and the cashflow to the new owner out of the window? That's kind of like the basics that I would be looking at and what you'll probably be able to ask leading into the deal.  Is there anything else, Charis or Luke? That you think you can ask or information that you would typically have pre-LOI about asset-heavy businesses?

19:48 - Charis Siau
  I think one to maybe ask is like lifetime, like how, what the average life of the dumpsters are, the roll-off dumpsters.  That could help in like calculation with, you know, replacement value and like what they currently have for their equipment and what on the depreciation scale, what age, right?  On average age they are, because if they're all on the older side, then you're looking at a replacement investment soon to be that's going to be quite cash heavy.  Versus newer equipment. So I think those are just some questions.

20:38 - Ryan Cash
  No, I think that's super relevant. am curious, like, I know, and this is just for me, having friends I grew up with who work at warehouses now and in supply chain, like, one big factor is also, like, the insurance life of an asset.  Like, know in a lot of warehouse and plant facilities, for example, forklifts, like, even though a forklift could last for 25 years, you can't keep it longer than a decade because the insurance company won't insure the forklift after a decade.  So they just end up going to scrap yards. You can't even sell it on the secondary market because you still can't insure the forklift, right, because it's so old.  So they end up just going to scrap heaps. So it is, I don't know if it's something that comes up, but it's something that's always top of mind to me.  Just because you have an asset that lasts for 20 years, it doesn't mean that it'll be an insurable. It's something that has people's lives on the line.  Just something that I would be curious about to keep in mind.

21:45 - Athena Simpson
  That's a really good point. Cash, I'd not heard of that before. So see, this is why I like people coming from different angles and different backgrounds because we learn stuff through each other.  This deal was so complicated, by the way.

21:59 - Ryan Cash
  This woman is not just selling these businesses. This Tampa mogul is selling his entire empire piece by piece. So it is this complicated chart that this woman is trying to divide some of these.  And most of them are already committed for by big private equity companies. But she's selling this one. And there's like a recycling company that she's selling for seven million.  That's part of this equation. There's like this complicated like map that looks like it's like a corkboard and yarn everywhere that's connecting all of these entities.  But yeah, anyway, it was an interesting one.

22:46 - Athena Simpson
  So these are carve-outs then of the overall holding company?

22:53 - Ryan Cash
  Yeah, I don't even know if it's under a holding company. I don't know if it's under one entity. I think they're all just separate assets that this guy has either started himself or bought from other people.  Some of these assets he's acquired, even with this roll-off thing. One of these roll-offs he started, and then the other one he acquired.  And it was the management team of the acquired business that is actually running both of them. So it was definitely a lot of information.  But I mean, if the SDE holds up, they're asking $4 million. It's generating from an SDE level, like a little under a million.  So at a gut check level, it looks like it could be a good opportunity. But there's also just a lot of moving pieces and I want to make sure that I don't look under the hood on this SDE with all these line items and figure out it's actually like 100,000 SDE at the end of the day.  Yeah, well, check.

24:06 - Athena Simpson
  So when it's asset heavy, I just look at the, like if you have the P&Ls, look at the depreciation, like how much depreciation is there?  And you can ask the broker too, like, hey, do you have any idea what the maintenance CapEx requirements of the businesses?  You know, they might actually, or they could ask the seller. And then you can also look at the depreciation number in the P&Ls as just like an early indication of what that might look like.  Um, but... Then again, it's like, whatever that investment was, was depreciated over an amount of time or whatever. So it just gives us an average, but it's something to call out in the write up like, hey, this is an asset heavy business.  And you will need to clarify this, you know, early on. But from what we can gather, this is kind of what it looks like.  The other thing, okay, so this is separate to asset heavy businesses. But when you're looking at somebody selling multiple entities in one deal, is I want to make sure that like, both entities are profitable, right?  That they're not like packaging in a loss leader.

25:12 - Ryan Cash
  Oh, yeah. I mean, it gets even more, I think, concerning the fact that there's even other companies like in this org chart, like, with how complicated these asset lists and profiles are of this organization.  Like, it could easily be that there's just non-performing assets of some other entity that is owned that's also being kind of offloaded into, you know, this one organization.  So I think kind of the risk factor is a little bit even more than just looking at the two companies, like with how breadth of an organizational chart this kind of falls under.

25:45 - Athena Simpson
  I mean, so like with all the complication and everything, you still think it sounds like a good potential deal?

25:52 - Ryan Cash
  Yeah, I mean, I like the cash flow for the price. Like I like their contracts. It's like commercial, it's commercial like waste removal, right?  Like the switching cost itself for like the client base is pretty big. Like the administrative cost of like one of these clients to try to go find a new waste removal company is more than what they'd be willing to do typically.  So I like the security of it. I like how diversified the customer concentration is. Like the price is pretty in ballpark.  It's just a matter of like, is the SDE actually there like for the price that you're buying? It's kind of the only thing that I would.  Want to have more clarity on, I guess.

26:41 - Athena Simpson
  Yeah, so have a look at the depreciation numbers, see if there's anything listed in the SIM, or if you can get clarity from the broker on maintenance CapEx.  And then Charis and Luke, when you're reviewing it, if you can just look at it through that lens of cash getting comfortable with heavy asset businesses and see if there's anything else you can call out or tease out to help with that.  But you're asking the right questions, Cash.

27:11 - Ryan Cash
  He also was willing to do 50% seller financing on it, which I thought was cool. So the seller's willing to do 50% seller financing on the deal, which was something that I thought was interesting.  If it can get an SBA approval and the owners also wants to... Do you know why he's offering 50%?  No, I don't know. I think he's just, I mean, what the broker told me in general is like, he's just burnt out from running this organization.  She said it's just like, he spent his entire career, he's like 63, he's built up this empire, and she said he's just burnt out completely from running it.  It is looking to sell. So I didn't question it. I didn't want to question why the 50% financing part, but maybe I should have.

28:14 - Athena Simpson
  So yeah, I would say like, whenever there's an outlier that can be a benefit, it could also be a red flag, which is the fun part of like, analyzing deals, right?  It's like, oh, that's great. But like, wait, why is he offering 50%? If he's like, I don't want the banks to get the interest.  That's awesome. Right. And he kind of understands. The benefit to him. Most of the time it's typically like it won't get financed or there's something else going on or they're like asking too high asking price.  So like, you know, whenever you guys see more than, you know, 10% and the seller's willing to do more than 10%, it's just good to ask a question like, Hey, I don't typically see that.  Like, you know, what's seller's reason for being up for doing that? Um, so I'd always dig into that when you see that.  Hopefully it is just a benefit, but sometimes there's more of the story there.

29:09 - Ryan Cash
  No, everything in this world. Yeah.

29:17 - Anke Jordaan
  And we still have to go through your and Charis's, um, and the Buyers Club updates. So sorry to interrupt.  Yeah. Cool.

29:26 - Athena Simpson
  No worries. Um, you get on that cash.

29:29 - Ryan Cash
  we'll get, yeah, I'm totally good. And I appreciate the clarity of questions that helps out a ton.

29:34 - Athena Simpson
  Okay, cool. Yeah, keep bringing them here. It's good. And then, you know, when you're getting these write-ups together, we're hoping with the peer reviews, they all learn through each other and can support each other on areas that you're getting up to speed on to.  you. Cool. So update for you all. Justin gave his notice yesterday or today. And I had a conversation with him and was able to get three more months of willing to work with us so we can fix some things.  So, you know, deal flow isn't what it should have been for the client. So you guys will hear me say this a lot, like perception is reality.  So even though we know all the reasons why it was low and we're getting people up to speed and blah, blah, blah, still doesn't change the client's experience of it.  So there's going to be a number of things that... We're going to do to make sure he has a good experience, but also just tighten up across the team now that we're starting to get into our flow and you guys are figuring out how to do write-ups and stuff.  The main thing really is deal flow. Getting the time from listing to clients' desk needs to be shortened because we're putting them in a situation where they don't even get a chance at it because it's a drag from that.  Anke has given me updates. It sounds like you guys have some really good plans there, but I just want to plant that seed that it's not just the volume of deal flow, but it's also, you know, do they get a crack at it?  How often are they getting there? And it's like, oh, there's a million other LOIs already in place and that sort of thing.  So the quicker that we can get it from it being listed, us coming across it to the client's desk is a benefit to them.  Equally, really ramping up that deal flow. And then the quality of deal flow. And Making sure it's a good fit for them and fits within their deal box and is a good deal.  So there's a lot more that we could be doing to increase deal flow. So now that we're getting into our stride, not just working what we have in there, but thinking about other things.  I know you guys have your brainstorm on that. And there's some other things that Anke and I are going to kind of revisit how we operationally add that.  But I just wanted to give you guys the update. This is going to be the risk with any of our clients that have been with us for a while.  Like I think we could be doing better by them and we've been doing our best. But now we've got a couple more people getting into our flow.  So, you know, let's try to knock it out of the park for everybody. And then Charis, there's an off-market deal that was a fit for one of our previous clients.
  ACTION ITEM: Pick up off-market deal previously passed by another client; repackage write-up; collab w/ Luke on deal fit
 - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/390417336?timestamp=1941.103569  They ended up passing on it. The risk profile was a little too much for them. And I talked to Justin and I was like, hey, would you like to take a look?  And. I think it could actually be a good fit. So I'd like you to pick that one up because it's an off-market, get an update.  Anke is going to give you the information that we have on the deal previously, but it's been quite a few months since we originally did the write-up, so it'll need to be repackaged.  It is one of Luke's clients, so you guys will need to collab on deal fit, but I just want you, since you're overseeing the off-market process right now, to kind of pick that one back up.

33:05 - Charis Siau
  Okay.

33:07 - Athena Simpson
  And I think that's a major update for now, but any questions, thoughts that I can answer before we move on to the next one?

33:19 - Charis Siau
  So essentially, like, Justin maybe needs, like, a little extra love towards, like, deal flow? Maybe. And he's in Austin, right?

33:31 - Athena Simpson
  Yeah.

33:32 - Charis Siau
  Okay. I'm saying all of our

33:35 - Ryan Cash
  That's right. Like he's the one who's exploring like the power sports deal. And he's been in like buyer's club talking about how he likes a lot of these conversations, right?

33:47 - Athena Simpson
  Yeah. But, you know, power sports is in a market that's not his. And he's officially passed on that. The other two businesses that he was, you know, hometown and the work lodge, like we sent those to him months ago.  So in terms of like new stuff that he's been able to sink his teeth into, haven't really sent him much.  You know, the fencing deal he was interested in that Luke just sent over, we got it to him like two weeks after it was listed.  So there was already seven LOIs on it because Austin is one of the most competitive markets there is. So, yeah, so he was feeling kind of frustrated, you know, and some of the other stuff that's been going over.  We've been trying to find things to fit, but the SDE is lower and that sort of thing. So we're.  We're going to revisit the deal box and make sure that we're looking at that. But any of the clients that have been with us before the new ones that you guys just onboarded are really at risk because as a team, we've not, you know, been delivering as many as we could.  It was a bottleneck on our side. So now that we have three of you, I think we can increase the deal flow across the board.  But, you know, the Gilles, the Stephen Pawleys, I'm trying to think who else. Luke has most of the legacy clients, but any of our legacy clients that were like pre-August first start, they're at risk of dropping if we don't start giving them some wins, you know.

35:23 - Luke Gillespie
  I feel like the problem is, which I understand what Justin's saying about that fencing company was on the market for two weeks and we didn't get it to them until.  Two weeks in, right? I think a problem is like the disconnection between the front end of the pipeline and the back end of the pipeline.  Because, and from Assam's team, from all the website scrapes, they get that deal immediately and it gets processed and it gets RFI'd.  But then after RFIing, we're kind of putting, after RFIing and in between getting the SIM received, we're kind of leaving it up to the broker and we're taking it out of our hands and letting it be on And so oftentimes, especially with these high quality deals, the brokers have so many people coming to them, they're going to give their attention to those who are coming at them the hardest, not those who just sent one email like, hey, can I take a look at the SIM?  And so like, that's what happened with that deal with Justin. I feel like that's what happens with a lot of deals because there's no communication, there's no connection between that front end of the pipeline and the analyst doing the write-ups.  Because analysts are mostly just waiting until the SIM gets received. And then a lot of these brokers are so unregulated.  And we're kind of abdicating our responsibility to the brokers to get back to us when we want to be more, you know, be in control of our results and be able to go to the brokers and make it our problem to go get the deal.  So I think that kind of disconnection from the front end and the back end is the cause for the timing misalignments.

37:00 - Athena Simpson
  Yeah. So I think it's good to have an eye on that. And then when you guys do your brainstorm, Luke, would be good for you to come up with some potential solutions to that.  Like what could analysts do? What could deal team do? Like so we can shorten the timeline and kind of overcome that.  Because again, the way that we did things was how we had to do them or what processes that we put in place.  But now that there's more of us, like, are there different things we can do or ways that we can rearrange the steps or just more taking action and accountability from your side?  And I know you have pretty good luck with just blasting through calling brokers and trying to get those. So learnings that you have from doing so many broker calls and collecting that information.  So when's the brainstorm, Anke? It's tomorrow?

37:47 - Anke Jordaan
  Yeah, tomorrow on the deal team. We're going to go through the ideas that we have on how to get improvements on deal flow.

37:55 - Athena Simpson
  Yeah. So please, you know, it's good to point that out. Even better if you can come up with some ideas and, you know, good thing about brainstorms is there's no bad ideas.  So just, you know, have fun coming up with all the potential solutions that you have. Have you guys heard me talk about back against the wall brainstorm?  Like, let's say all of our clients tomorrow say they're going to cancel. Like, what do we need to do?  Our backs against the wall, how are we going to fight out of it as a team? You know, because we can't just rest on, they think we're doing really good and they really enjoy our value and that sort of thing.  It's like, they're not, they're not getting the result quick enough and we can get them more. Our deal flow, we can get it to them quicker.  There's little things that we can do to improve the process now that there's more of us and we have all these amazing minds on the team where we didn't before.  We were, you know, strapped. But Ray's here now. Ida's like supporting on the deal flow. We've got Cash and Charis.  Anke has been taken off everything else and is focused on operations. So like what can we collectively do as a team to fix some of that?  Our backs against the wall. So brainstorm anything and everything without thinking about whether it's practical or whether it can be done.  That's the fun part about brainstorms is that you can just throw a bunch of things out there and it might spark ideas like, oh, what if we did that?  Or that's a great idea. We could do that so that you can build on it. So I don't know if Anke gave you that kind of brief, but that's typically what I like to see with brainstorms, right?  We're not thinking about the practicalities on it. Brainstorms are like coming up with ideas and then ideas that spark some ideas.  Then you can look at them. And practicalities afterwards. So it'll be fun. It should be fun. You know, fighting out of it.  All the clients are about to create a mutiny. How do we like get them a bunch of deal flow?  Amazing. Not that they're there, but I'm just saying like giving you a picture of what, what our back against the wall might feel like.  Right. And how can we fight our way out of it?

40:05 - Anke Jordaan
  Well, I always say, I it'd be the buffaloes running into the rain, not the cows.

40:10 - Athena Simpson
  Yeah. Yeah. But, you know, we're doing something nobody's ever done before. There's a reason why other people don't do off markets or on market sourcing for people.  You know, Charis is getting up to speed on the off market. So hopefully we can get that cranking too, which will alleviate some pressure on the on market.  But in the meantime, what are ways to clean up a process that's not working or we have some drop offs at different points, you know?  So there's, there's inefficiencies already in the system and bottom. Next, or drop-offs that we could dive into and see if we can clean that up while we get the off-market pumping again.  Cool. Any questions, thoughts on that? Good. Looking forward to the brainstorm. Great. Cash, I have not had a chance to catch up on Slack.  I just saw that PJ sent some questions for the call.

41:04 - Ryan Cash
  Are you good with that? know Luke's going to be joining you. Those are questions that he came up with.  He's meeting with that team tomorrow night, so he's driving over to Battery Jack to meet with them. I looked through them.  They seem really good. I like that they're more focused on the big picture of the company and how he could see himself fitting into that.  I was kind of concerned they were going to be nitpicky and really small level, but I think he did a good job of opening.  Like big picture stuff, like seeing himself in the organization. So that's what I like. But yeah, fortunately, Luke will also be on that call.
  ACTION ITEM: Prep for Battery Jack meeting w/ PJ; review questions & current status; discuss SBA equity limitations
 - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/390417336?timestamp=2501.103569  And he wrote the report on Battery Jack. So I think it's a good time for Luke to be there.

41:51 - Athena Simpson
  And I think we'll have a good conversation. Cool. Did you guys or will you have a chance to just get together before the call so Luke's up to speed on where it's at?

42:04 - Ryan Cash
  We can. I mean, I think it's pretty straightforward. He's meeting with the owners of the company. But if we need to huddle and go into deeper, we can do that.

42:13 - Athena Simpson
  Okay, great. We'll talk, yeah.

42:16 - Luke Gillespie
  Okay.

42:17 - Athena Simpson
  The only thing that jumped out at me on the questions was him asking if they want to earn equity later.  Why might that be a point of talking with Peter? And Cash, going to, I think Luke might know the answer, but Cash, I'm going to start with you.  And I do this annoyingly. I try to see like what knowledge.

42:35 - Ryan Cash
  I'm you have, it's not to put you on the spot. No, I got you. Which is question, is it your expectation that you have equity after the sale?  Yeah, because just through SBA guidelines, right? Like it's not going to be, it's not going to be SBA approved if it's not a hundred percent asset sale.

42:57 - Athena Simpson
  That's not entirely true.

42:59 - Ryan Cash
  Or is it like 24 months? Like they have to, the management can't stay on longer than 24 months. after like the transaction, something around that.

43:09 - Athena Simpson
  No. So this is good. Cause this is a cleanup area. So if a previous owner retains equity in the new deal, then they have to personally guarantee the full loan for two years.  If it is a hundred percent buyout, then previous owners typically can only stay in for a year, but there's some gray area.  Beyond that, which we've talked about, you know, then it's just down to the client to talk about that verbally rather than having it in the purchase agreement.  But earning back equity after the fact, depending on when he's talking about that, SBA will have to approve any equity given, which could trigger that personal guarantee.  So when clients put things like that into it, we just want to catch it and be like, hey, are you aware of, you know, all the SBA limitations around equity with a previous owner?  And if he's like, yep, I'm good, then cool. If not, then it's like, you know, if you let them retain equity, they're going to be on the hook, personally guaranteeing it.  And the asking if they want to earn it back, that can be weird with SBA and potentially trigger that personal guarantee.  But it, it, you are able to do a partial buyout. So it's not that it wouldn't qualify. You can do a partial with rollover equity, but with the SOP change, with the previous owners having to personally guarantee, most of them aren't going to necessarily want to do that.

44:45 - Ryan Cash
  Gotcha. Sounds clear.

44:47 - Athena Simpson
  Cool. All right. Charis, let's get to your stuff.

44:53 - Charis Siau
  Okay. So there's a really interesting deal. I like like every, a lot about the deal. It's a automated LOI.  It's called LOI Blaster. They work with real estate, like investors and developers to automate and get out LOIs for real estate deals within like seconds.  Purely recurring revenue. It's only a year and a half. Is that a deal breaker? Is there any way? I was thinking for this one, either Gil or Jim.

45:31 - Athena Simpson
  Are you and what's the... asking price for it?

45:36 - Charis Siau
  2.9 and it's 700 SDE.

45:42 - Athena Simpson
  Okay. And is the, are they willing to do seller finance or have they addressed any of the fact that likely won't qualify for SBA and the conversations or anything?

45:54 - Charis Siau
  Yeah. They said because of that, you know, because of the young age, it likely won't qualify. Um, I'm not sure if that's like a complete deal breaker, if there's any, like, you know, workarounds with the, the young age being a factor.

46:10 - Athena Simpson
  Yeah. So, um, typically that this, this will be a strategic buyer that will come in and be able to pay all cash.  Um, so when I, when you see something like this, I'd talk to the broker and be like, Hey, I have a, you know, owner operator buyer.  They were going to use SBA is the owner open to any creative financing. Um, if they're, you know, but most of the time they'll be like, we want a strategic or private equity that don't just offer all cash.

46:35 - Charis Siau
  No, he's good. He understands the buyer profiles. And he said that they're open to creative structuring as well. So I just wasn't sure if we put those kind of young deals in front of our clients or not.  But I like so much about the deal and wanted to check first.

46:55 - Athena Simpson
  Yeah, I mean, it feels more like, because remind me, does Jim also have an engineering background or am I modeling my experience?

47:04 - Charis Siau
  comes from 20 years in the real estate. That's why I think it's good for him.

47:09 - Athena Simpson
  Right. So he might want, like, then it's looking at the current owner and what is their expertise? Are they the one, like, coding and doing that?  Or are they, like, they've got a team that's doing all the tech stuff and they're looking over the strategy and the relationships for the clients?  I don't necessarily disqualify this. If there is another way to finance it. Usually, typically, the reason why we're... Eliminating deals that are less than three years old is because they won't qualify for SBA financing and the seller is not open to any other arrangement to make it happen.

47:46 - Charis Siau
  Because most of our clients won't have the cash to be able to just pay all cash unless it's like in the million dollar range, then they can potentially find something.

47:54 - Athena Simpson
  Then the other nuance is risk appetite, right?

47:57 - Charis Siau
  Gil is pretty risk averse.

48:01 - Athena Simpson
  Jim is still new, so I don't know what his feelings are on that. But like there's that risk of being in a high growth, brand new business and like does the client have that kind of risk appetite or ability to facilitate a fast growing business?  Because it's, you know, I mean, you guys are in one, so it's a bit of a wild ride as opposed to like a stable.  So I'd look at their business questionnaire and see what they said about stable. out. out. out. Versus fast growing, how long they wanted it in existence and just see if they had strong preferences there.  But sorry, everything is like a nuanced answer. It's never a yes or no. I apologize. But it's kind of like looking at all the variables and then you can call that out to them.  Like, hey, you know, this is the word on this one. It's a year and a half. However, they're open to alternative financing structures to potentially, because the first thing they're going to say is, well, how would I buy it?  Like, I don't have all the cash, right? So the owner's open to creative structuring. But usually with software businesses, like a strategic will come in and just pay all the cash.  So they're kind of hard to help individual buyers be competitive on.

49:18 - Charis Siau
  Okay. Okay. Got it. All right. Noted. I know my next steps there. Another deal that I'm reviewing, I really like it.  The bigger issue is just a bit of lumpiness because of the way they've managed their. Inventory. So for example, like due to tariffs, they panicked a little and overordered and stacked up on inventory.  And so their numbers like this year look worse. Does that kind of thing come up in the Q of E or is there, because I know inventory is a little bit difficult, right, to get a wrap on that and they're showing big swings.  So I was just trying to think a way to position that on the write up on like a solution on where we can tackle the inventory swings.

50:12 - Athena Simpson
  Yeah, it's, it's, it'll probably come up, honestly, like when they start having lender reviews, but the lenders, as long as there's a story to why the numbers are lumpy and why there's that, you know, and obviously everybody knew there was tariff panic.  So it's, it's understandable and it's, it's a very like verifiable and understandable story to why the numbers shifted like that.  So if we were to like normalize it, you know, and remove that, then how is the business potentially performing from like revenue, other expenses, that sort of thing, like OPEX, like were there any other swings in the numbers apart from the inventory?  That's what I'd be looking at. And if not, then yeah, like likely the lenders will pick up on that, might have to do some creative structuring around that, like with performance-based notes or, you know, however the inventory is being accounted for in the deal, like, you know, putting the extra inventory on consignment potentially and just figuring out like networking capital of like what the normal level of inventory that they need to keep.  And then everything else they could just pay, you know, on consignment and pay for it as they need it kind of thing.

51:26 - Charis Siau
  Yeah. Okay. So making, making just like an adjustment there. Yeah. Okay, cool. Um, and then. Just putting a thought here to, I know we've been having quite a bit of conversation about our clients like SDE numbers, because right now we're taking them from the discovery calls and having that buyer discovery call.  And it's all in just conversation right now about their SDE, their minimum, their ideal. And I think across several members in the team, I'm seeing just like a bit of confusion on like, oh, what is really their minimum SDE?  it pre-tax, post-tax? So just something I'm thinking that could be helpful is having them fill that out in an actual form that we can revisit back with instead of it being conversation.  I can tell in my first call with them and then maybe like another calls with them, they have some adjustments too, because in conversation, I think maybe with...  It just being a quick question. I know we're prying into it, but then later they're like, oh, did I say 500K?  Maybe actually a million. I just had this conversation with Jim, actually, and he wanted to change his SDE. So I think if they have a little bit more time to think about their numbers when they're filling out it in a questionnaire, just something to think about also for our reference going back into it.  Like I'm seeing all kinds of different numbers on like their buyer profiles and, you know, based from the conversation, just a thought.  So that takes some tighter steering from our side too.

53:14 - Athena Simpson
  Like, so they'll say what they think the SDE should be, but really what we should be working off of is like, what do they need to hit their bank account?  Because the valuation is going to change, right? So like if he says a million, but you found something that got him the same cash after debt service that was lower than that, you know, so.  I guess we need to have a more nuanced conversation about this. It's because the conversations changed hands so many times in the onboarding process.  Now we're handing it over to you guys and I need to do some more training with you on that because I don't like people saying I want a million in SDE because they don't know what the valuation of the business is.  They don't know how much they're going to need for reinvestment, etc., etc. So what I want us to be evaluating businesses on is what their net free cash flow that they want after debt service.  And then we're looking at it through the analyst lens of, okay, is there still enough for them to invest in the business, make that free cash flow number?  Is the valuation sound? Is the debt service coverage ratio comfortable? So I hear you that we absolutely need to tighten that up.  I worry with handing it over to the clients when they don't have enough sophisticated Like analysis and deal structuring to understand what setting their minimum SDE number actually means.

54:44 - Charis Siau
  Okay. Yeah, that makes sense. I mean, maybe, maybe two, like before that call, I don't know if this is too much asking them to fill out like two different forms or what, but I don't know, maybe they can spend a bit of more time before the call thinking about it.  And then we can revisit that on our call, you know, and kind of like validate whether those numbers are legit and, you know, going to float our deal search.  Just something to think about, because I feel like they're a little rushed to give us answers on the first call, because we do have a lot to go through on that first call.  So just something to think about on whether, whether we can get it a bit more papered, but I do agree with you.
  ACTION ITEM: Add SDE/real estate discussion to next week's agenda; plan deep dive session on accurate SDE determination
 - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/390417336?timestamp=3326.103569  I think having, you know, a bit more of a deeper dive into that with you. And. And. Thank And helping us just like get that accurate number is important for sure.

55:40 - Athena Simpson
  Okay. Anke, will you put this on the list with real estate? And then let's spend some time next week to talk through SDE and real estate.  And I think it can be like the more up to speed you guys get, then in those onboarding sessions, you can have those conversations.  And then when you put the deal profiles in front of them, like, hey, just confirming this still feels good.  And then as you're going through the first write-ups, that's why it's a calibration process. So like, if he's like saying, I want a million in SDE, you'd be like, why is that?  What's making you feel that way? You know? Oh, I heard that it should be at least as much out there.  And it's like, well, okay, well, what's more important to you? Like the amount of SDE pre-debt service or the amount of cash that's hitting your bank account to make this feel worthwhile for you?  So it's one of those like nuanced guiding conversations that like during the calibration period, you... You guys will want to have also.  Does that make sense? Yeah.

56:43 - Charis Siau
  Yeah. Because I would be like, why did he double that?

56:45 - Athena Simpson
  And also, does he have the ability to finance that? What's his pre-qual?

56:51 - Charis Siau
  Uh, four point something, four point, four point seven. Okay.

56:57 - Athena Simpson
  So yeah, he'd barely just be able to, to do that. If you know, most million dollar EBITDA businesses are going to be 4X.  So like, why, like my question would be like, why does he want to increase it? I'm just conscious of time and I have no idea what's going on with Buyers Club and we're starting in a minute.  Um, can you guys be like rapid, um, um, like cash, this is helpful, but I don't know what deals they are.  So like, if I'm going to be discussing the deals with the clients, I kind of need a little bit more information.  So I doubt Peter will be joining, but if you want to talk me through Michael and Federico real quick.

57:37 - Ryan Cash
  Okay, so SP is Bambiz, which they rejected their deal. So that's probably going to be the only thing that they're going to have updates on or want to talk about.  But they offered 10% down and 10% financing, and that got rejected. So MW and FR just received their first write-ups, and they're trying to get a hold of their brokers.  I know Federico just talked with a broker. He just slacked a message like five minutes ago. Okay, what are the write-ups?  The Federico is for the carpet company, Barton Carpets, and Michael is for Powerline Machinery, the machinery distribution company out of Florida.

58:16 - Athena Simpson
  Okay, what were their concerns on these deals, or how did they feel on them? What might I have to discuss with them on it?

58:25 - Ryan Cash
  So Michael really likes the deal. He likes a lot about it. He does have concerns over... The current owner is, he's working, he's going to be working on a second company which sells smaller parts of machinery.  And Michael has a lot of concerns about the growth potential. And he's kind of gone like full conspiracy theory, frankly, on like why the owner is selling.  And it's kind of been a blocker to him getting excited about it. Federico likes the business, location. He likes a lot of things about it.  The margins are still a concern for him. And the current deal is based on his feedback from the broker that he just got.  He won't even know if the deal is still available until next week. I think their current LOI like expires like next week on the deal.  So the broker did send Federico the full set of P&Ls and a lot of additional information to review.

59:39 - Athena Simpson
  Oh, they're under LOI.

59:43 - Ryan Cash
  That's what it seems. The broker says we'll know for sure if the current LOI is moving forward or not within a week.  So actually, I don't know what that means. Federico said he's not sure if the current LOI is moving forward.  I don't know if it means that it is under LOI right now or if they're going to move forward with an LOI.  Okay, so seeking some clarity there.

1:00:08 - Athena Simpson
  Okay, cool. Thank you. Luke, I'm up to speed on Justin. I don't think Jenny will join. DL, likely not.  Anything? Morgan hasn't been joining, so.

1:00:26 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah.

1:00:27 - Athena Simpson
  Looks like he's really happy, so that's awesome.

1:00:30 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah.

1:00:34 - Athena Simpson
  Okay, cool. Okay, And then, Charis, in case Jim joins.

1:00:40 - Charis Siau
  Yeah, so he's been introed to the broker for his first write-up. It's on Barber Welding, so it's a metal fab shop.  Most likely, it's a pass because it's too long of a commute. So it's, yeah, just probably a practice run for him on this deal.

1:00:57 - Athena Simpson
  Okay, great. So this is good. What would be helpful is if, when you guys do these updates, just tell me what the blocker is with a client.  If, like, it could use some Athena-level coaching, like if they're, you know, just like you said, like Michael going conspiracy theory, that's usually where my spidey sense is and getting them on track.  Or if you feel like they're not moving forward or not being fast enough, like if you just call out anything that would be helpful for me to talk about on these calls.  And that's usually where I can help you guys.

1:01:32 - Luke Gillespie
  Sweet. Luke, anything I need to know?

1:01:35 - Athena Simpson
  I'm... I kind of skipped yours, but you did a good update there.

1:01:40 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah. Well, like you said, most of my clients don't really join. So you're up to date on Justin. Jenny, I did get her a new write-up, like a small auto body shop, auto body and detailing shop in Cleveland.  She didn't really like how small it was and the nature of it being that service-based business. It's not super scalable, which is some valid feedback.  I pushed back on her. I'm going to try to get her to do a broker call. haven't heard back from her on Slack yet.  BL, I mean, I got them a gold dealer that's doing $2 million in SDE in Miami. But again, these clients don't really join the club.  So I don't want to take up your time right now.

1:02:17 - Athena Simpson
  Okay, cool. Thanks, guys. Good work. We got movement with all the clients, which is exciting. So well done. I'll see you in 60 seconds.  All right. Bye. Bye.
