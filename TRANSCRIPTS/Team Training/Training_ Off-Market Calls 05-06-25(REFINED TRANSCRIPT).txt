0:00 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Hey, Luke. Apologies for running so over. We had an interview run long before.

0:07 - Luke Gillespie (Unrestricted)
  No problem. I know you're busy. So thanks for taking the time for this call, no matter how much we get.  All right.

0:14 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Well, I'm happy to make the time.

0:16 - Luke Gillespie (Unrestricted)
  This is a good investment for my time.

0:19 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So what I wanted to chat through today was, I know we don't have it outlined at all in the handbook, like what happens after you have that first initial call.  So I wanted to chat through, like, I know you've had, how many first calls have you had at this point?

0:40 - Luke Gillespie (Unrestricted)
  Uh, I'd say three, I think.

0:42 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah. Three. Okay. And are you wanting to move them forward to like next conversation?

0:47 - Luke Gillespie (Unrestricted)
  I moved all of them forward to getting an NDA.

0:50 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah. Okay, great. So then, then I wanted to chat through what happens next and make sure we're on the same page there and that you're feeling comfortable with how that goes.  So does that sound like a good use of time, or did you have any questions about the initial calls?

1:06 - Luke Gillespie (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, no, that sounds good. That was one of the questions I wanted to talk about. Yeah, just sort of understand the process and what the next steps will be, because that's also what I'm getting asked on the calls by the owners.  So we know that we don't maybe have as clear of a process right now. That's why we're building it all out and stuff.  So, yeah, it would be good to be able to have a formalized process and steps in my head that I could speak on.

1:28 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, we have a process. It just wasn't written down despite my requests. Well, I'm writing it down now. Yeah, great.  I've been asking for SOPs since Ryan started for writing down of the process. So we're doing it now. So if we pull up the, let me pull up the handbook.

1:54 - Luke Gillespie (Unrestricted)
  And I've started just putting in the kind of headers.

1:58 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Off-market. Playbook. Okay. So owner call. Okay. When I get on to the owner call, the first one, I kind of explain what the steps are going to be.  So they know what happens when, right? So it's holding the frame very briefly right at the beginning. If you're listening to some of my early calls, I'm hoping that I did that.  But it's something that I've refined in the sales process too, which is like, hey, I'm Athena. Like, you know, I run this business and actually my connection to this is my parents and blah, blah, blah.  So you have a little intro about you that establishes credibility and why. I have a client that's in your neighborhood that's amazing.
  ACTION ITEM: Write intro script for 1st owner call explaining process + expectations - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/292841222?timestamp=176.9999  And they're looking for businesses to buy and they are looking for businesses like yours. looking businesses. Which is why I wanted to have the conversation.  So thanks for taking a call from a stranger from the internet. Let me just tell you really quickly how this is going to go.  And so today we're just going to get to know each other. I'm going to ask you some questions. I won't ask anything like too specific, but I want you to feel comfortable enough with me by the end of this call that we'll send you a confidentiality agreement.  So that's from us to you saying that whatever you share after we sign that will just be between us.  So use normal language, Luke. It's really important. Different from brokers with owners. You just want to use like normal language, confidentiality agreement that will protect you so that whatever you share with us going forward, we can't share with anyone else outside of our team.  And then what we're going to do, you know, and then I'm going to ask you some questions so I can understand a little bit more about you and your business.  And if it's... It's like a good fit for our client. Then I'll ask you if you'd like to sign an NDA.  And then after the NDA, we'll collect some financial information from you. So we can also make sure that this is an investment that would work for our client.  We're not going to like hold you to any numbers or anything. We know that taxes are different than the financials, but it's just so we can start to get a financial picture.  After we do that, then we'll schedule a follow up call. We'll talk through things. I'll make sure that, you know, you feel comfortable with what the next steps look like.  We don't share anything with the client unless you give us express permission to do so. And then when you feel comfortable, then we'll make an introduction and you'll talk to our client, right?  And we won't share anything with them unless they've also signed an NDA and you're comfortable with us making that introduction.  I did something to that effect. On the SSS calls. So I would listen to that, like grab that call into HubSpot and listen to that too, because he's like, can you tell me about what you guys do?  And I was like, sure. You know, like, so that's kind of the question in their mind is like, well, how is this going to work?  So this is actually like when you're giving, when you're starting an event, like a lot of people don't know this, but like the most important thing in people's heads is like, when am I going to get a break?  Where are the bathrooms? When am I getting food? Right? So cover off the like basic needs right at the beginning, then, then they're much more open.  So, and also you're removing any concerns, like I'm not going to be getting really deep into financials today. I'm just going to be understanding you and the business and, you know, what your, what your current situation is.  If you're not comfortable sharing anything today, that's okay. You can just tell me, don't want to talk about that yet.  You know, so you give them permission that like they're in control. You're not. You're going to ask anything too deep today.  And then you're planting the seed that if at the end of the call, you both feel good about the conversation, then you'll sign the NDA.
  ACTION ITEM: Create bullet list of off-market process steps - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/292841222?timestamp=371.9999  So that's usually, it's called setting the frame, right? You kind of taking control, like I'm here to guide this conversation.  Here's what's going to happen. Here's what's to expect at the end. And here's what to expect in the process.  So I'll just very quickly map out what the next steps are. I would script all that out and drop it into owner call one so I can review it and help you edit it.  And then you just have it in front of you to read every single time.

6:39 - Luke Gillespie (Unrestricted)
  Okay. Okay. Can I do it in like bullet points? Like instead of a specific script, do like, like I just talk off bullet points rather than a paragraph, you know, would that be doable if it makes sense?  Or like bullet points would be like introducing, introduce myself, establish credibility. Yeah. Yeah. I have a client in your neighborhood looking to buy businesses like yours.  Next bullet point, thanks for talking to a random stranger from the internet. I know you get a lot of scams.  Next bullet point, just going to explain the process to you real quick. Next bullet point, we're just going to get to know each other, and so on.  Would that work, or do you look in a paragraph format?

7:21 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So the best practice when you're doing sales is scripting.

7:28 - Luke Gillespie (Unrestricted)
  Okay.

7:28 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So you know word for word, and you read that script until you memorize it, right?

7:33 - Luke Gillespie (Unrestricted)
  Okay.

7:34 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  And if you're going to train somebody else, what are you going to need?

7:39 - Luke Gillespie (Unrestricted)
  Word for word.

7:40 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Right. So we're building out a process that we will be able to give to other people also, and it's best practice to have that script, because then you don't need to, like, he can't see you reading, right?

7:54 - Luke Gillespie (Unrestricted)
  Yeah.

7:55 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  And make inflection points and stuff. Like, that's what I do. But I have a script open every... Every single time I do a sales call, I've done hundreds, you know, and I have a script open when I do the owner call, you know, like, I don't know where, you know, it's just kind of, we lost the thingy on it.  But like, I always write a script for myself. I'll use ChatGPT to write a script for myself. It removes you having to think and remember.  And the more you read it, the more it's natural. So then it ends up being that. And you can always create a bullet point list off the script.

8:34 - Luke Gillespie (Unrestricted)
  But in order for me to make sure that, like, you're, you've really captured the whole essence of that intro, the script is the best place to start.  Yeah. All right. Sounds good.

8:45 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  I'll write a script. Well, you can take the transcripts from this. You can take the transcripts from my SSS call.  You can take the transcripts. Like, I don't mind you using ChatGPT and having it help you write a script, right?  Like, here's the bullet points that I want. But It is best practice. And when we get more people in to do this, we also want to make sure that there's no room for interpretation for how this call goes, right?  Because that's what happened with our process is there was a bunch of room for interpretation and the original templates that we used got completely changed or not used at all.  And then we got far off from what our original intent was.

9:27 - Luke Gillespie (Unrestricted)
  Okay. Got it. Okay.

9:29 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Austin is reading scripts right now. Austin has 13 page scripts that he's memorizing right now.

9:36 - Luke Gillespie (Unrestricted)
  Yeah.

9:37 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  And he's been doing this for a really long time and he wants a script, right?

9:42 - Luke Gillespie (Unrestricted)
  Yeah.

9:43 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Why do you think that is?

9:46 - Luke Gillespie (Unrestricted)
  Because that's how he can do the sales calls the best because it looks like scripts is the best way to do it.  Austin would know better than I.

9:54 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  What's that?

9:55 - Luke Gillespie (Unrestricted)
  Austin would know better than I.

9:59 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  But there's a reason why the top. Performers want, right? So, and also we're going to do this for your broker calls too, because you're not going to be the only one doing broker calls.  So we need to like get that script dialed in for anyone. Like how do I approach a broker call?  And obviously we're going to like ask questions and like freestyle a little bit, but when you have that script there, then you can lean on that when, um, when you need it.  Or if you don't do an owner call for a while, it's just like, I don't need to remember how this goes.

10:25 - Luke Gillespie (Unrestricted)
  It's just right there. Yeah. I can already make a broker call script off the top of my head.

10:31 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  I already have my own script. I just haven't written it down, but yeah. Exactly. Well, that we're, we're coming after you next.  So, but the important components, right. And you can, you can write an outline of like what the components are and why they're there, right.  Introduce ourselves, establish credibility, um, tell them what's coming next and make them feel comfortable. Make them feel like we're not going to go into anything, tell them what's going to happen at the end of the call and that it's a mutual trust.  In order to move forward, right? So that we understand why we have the script the way it does. And then in terms of the process itself, so the NDA next steps, it's a little, where is the template?  Okay. It's a little too long. So we actually need to reduce that, but like, it's what we've been using anyway.

11:36 - Luke Gillespie (Unrestricted)
  So typically that message, the HubSpot template you mean?

11:39 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah.

11:39 - Luke Gillespie (Unrestricted)
  Okay. Okay.

11:40 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  We're going to be revising that when we go through all the copy, but just use it because it's what we've been using for now.  But basically what we want to do is get them to sign the NDA. Then once they've signed the NDA, like, please, please, can you send me the last three years of profit loss statements?

11:57 - Luke Gillespie (Unrestricted)
  Yeah.

12:00 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  And once they send the profit and loss statements, I say, thank you so much. Give me a few days to review it.  And then I'm going to schedule some time for us to do a follow-up call to talk through these. So the reason why I do that is because when they send financials, it's kind of like opening the kimono, right?  Like it's a scary thing to do to send your financials to a stranger. So I always want them to feel like they know what's happening.  So when they send it, I'm like, hey, thank you so much. Give me a couple of days to review.  I'll be in touch and we'll schedule a follow-up chat. So they know where they are in the process. Then I take those financials and I plug them into the financial template that we have for clients.  So I'm doing that right now for SSS. Let me show you what I'm doing.

12:59 - Luke Gillespie (Unrestricted)
  Awesome, thanks. Been wanting to get more hands on the financial modeling anyways.

13:04 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, I mean, it makes our client's life a hell of a lot easier when it's already plugged in there, too.  So it's a nice little value add. This one's a little complicated because he has two businesses that he's selling.
  SCREEN SHARING: Athena started screen sharing - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/292841222?timestamp=809.304709  Let me share my screen. I mean, you know how to read a profit and loss statement, yeah?

13:33 - Luke Gillespie (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, of course.

13:35 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Cool. So in this one, it's like, okay, he's sent me all the tax documents. I'm not looking at that yet.  I'm just looking at the P&Ls and going in and grabbing total income, going in here, dropping it into 21.  So on this general tab, you'll just want to make sure you mark the years that you actually have. If they haven't sent a trailing 12-month, then just change this to the most recent year and make sure this column is populated because this is what pulls into the forecasting. So I'm currently waiting for this 2024, which is why this isn't populated right now.  And then as I'm going through it, I start highlighting things and I'm like, what the  is that? Right? In red.  So I know what things I need to make notes of. So I've also started a questions thing, like, right.  So like, um, for the ad backs for 2024, um, year to date, I need those ideally trailing 12 months.  So if they have QuickBooks, then you just need to get them to do like, Hey, could you send me the past 12 months (trailing 12 months)?  So you get a few financial statements from them. I plug it in and then I ask for more. Um, so I've asked him for Green Forest.  He's like, oh, the PNLs are in two different places. And I was like, why don't you send me both parts and I can figure it out.  Right. Yeah. Make their lives easy because what I'm trying to figure out. Um, so what are you seeing already in these numbers?

15:20 - Luke Gillespie (Unrestricted)
  1% net income margin in 2022. yeah. Large other income in 2021, which would be important to know about because maybe that could be add backs or something like that.

15:33 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Um, and like, what are you seeing in the revenue?

15:38 - Luke Gillespie (Unrestricted)
  Yeah. revenue was decreasing and the, but the operating expenses were also decreasing, but they were, yeah. So they decreased a little bit in 2023.  They were pretty consistent in 21, 22, and then dropped in 23, but their profitability improved greatly in 2023.

15:57 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah. So we want to like, just like, what happened? You know, but your EBITDA shot up pretty considerably, like, you know, your cost of goods, like, up, like, what happened there, right?

16:11 - Luke Gillespie (Unrestricted)
  Yeah.

16:13 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  In SSS, this is the fencing company. We've got a spike at 22. It's either a spike or it was just, you know, 22 is usually the year when I see a spike.  So it's like, okay, well, what happened there? Um, I haven't gotten to the point where I've added his ad backs yet.  So the, the PNLs don't tell us the full story, but, um, what I need to add back is here's all the ad backs he's already sent me. There's like 17 that I need to add in there.

16:50 - Luke Gillespie (Unrestricted)
  So this guy has been super tax efficient.

16:53 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Um, on the, uh, fencing company, Green Forest. He bought in 2024. So he wasn't the previous owner in these years.

17:05 - Luke Gillespie (Unrestricted)
  So that's interesting, right?

17:08 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So this was weird because he, like other income, it was like consulting income for like $250,000, $300,000. I was like, what the  is that?  So I start just like, as I go through this, I'll just start making notes. It's, you know, what's the other income?  $321,000. Other expense for consulting of $187,000. This one, interestingly, the depreciation, amortization, interest was all considered other expense instead of like OPEX.  So I had to add back in here and then take it out here. Otherwise, the EBITDA wouldn't have been correct.  So I just start plugging it in because that's the easiest way. For me to start seeing where I need to ask questions, you know, because I'm like, Oh, I see there's a drop here.  And why are there these weird things in the P&L? So I'll make a new template for every business and I'll just, I'll just drop them in.  And then that way we send it over to the client. Like we've already pre-populated the numbers. What a nice, what a nice service for them.  You know, I start with the P&Ls. And then ask them about different things. And then I will usually pull out the things that I think are ad backs.  And we have to explain to what ad backs are because like, they will be uncomfortable. It's like, we're not the IRS.  This is normal. We expect that. So basically where I want to get to you with these ones on, on your next one is I want you to collect the financials and start plugging in.  The financials. Tell them what comes next, if you haven't already. So like, hey, here's what happens next. You're going to send me some financials.  I'm going to review it. Then we'll schedule a call to go through it again. Then I might have some follow-up questions or follow-up documents that I might need from you so that I can get a rough idea of what your business valuation might be and see if you're interested in being introduced to one of our clients at that point.  So if you haven't told them that's what's coming next, then we need to do that with the follow-up with the NDA.  Have they signed the NDAs yet?

19:41 - Luke Gillespie (Unrestricted)
  One has, yes. One gave me a response that I was going to consult you in a deal review tonight to ask you about what you thought.  And yeah, one has. He told me he's just been waiting on his accountant. And yeah, I've just been asking him for updates.

19:57 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah. Okay. So you, you, you can say like, Hey. It's okay to sign the NDA in the meantime, so at least we have that covered off while you're working on your financials.  Yeah.

20:09 - Luke Gillespie (Unrestricted)
  One guy, he already signed the NDA. He's the one that we're just waiting on the accountant. And then one didn't sign it yet, responded some things that he wanted to hear from us first.

20:17 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So I was going to bring that up in the vetting call today. Okay, cool. Yeah, good for the team to hear it too, because Ida will probably be doing some of these responses.  Okay, so there's three in total, you said?

20:31 - Luke Gillespie (Unrestricted)
  Yes, three. But one was that real estate wholesaler, and he hasn't responded to the NDA yet. And actually, at the end of that call, when I told him we would probably want to see tax returns later in the process, he kind of got uncomfortable.  was like, oh, tax returns. And then I asked him, I was like, oh, have you been filing taxes? And he's like, yeah, yeah, yeah, I file taxes for the business.

20:54 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So yeah. That's, you want to explain. And that's why I'm hoping when you listen to the calls, like from Bill and Josanne, like when you listen to all of them that I had with them, you'll hear how I explain that.  I want you to pull a copy from that and pull scripts from that. Like you can drop it into Descript and grab language there that we can start building out a script for like these different calls and what we say in different lines.  Because we want to alleviate their concerns. Like, hey, we love tax efficiency and it's normal. It is normal for you to run, you know, things through the business to help with your taxes.  So we're not here to audit your taxes, but in order to get SBA funding, like we have to, you know, make sure that what you're saying in the P&L matches the tax returns.  So, you know, at this stage, I wouldn't even mention on the first call, wouldn't even mention tax returns.

21:54 - Luke Gillespie (Unrestricted)
  I just say like, you need your profit and loss statements.

21:57 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  And then when you get on the next, because you want to kind of like breadcrumb it. Okay. Give them the whole like synopsis of what's going to happen, but like very brief, right?  So they know where they are in the journey. And then on each call, you kind of get a little, that's where I don't like overwhelm them with like ad backs, you know, and even the NDA and then saying like, and then I'm going to need P&Ls.  It's like, I'd rather chunk that down and be like, Hey, first you signed the NDA. Then I'm going to ask you for some financial statements after the NDA is signed.

22:28 - Luke Gillespie (Unrestricted)
  Right.

22:28 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So then, then they're not holding off signing the NDA because they don't have the financial statements. So we're going to break this process down a little bit more.  So what I want you to do following this conversation is write out your introscript of how this works and then bullet point what your understanding of each step of the process is.
  ACTION ITEM: Draft email template for post-NDA/financials follow-up - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/292841222?timestamp=1368.9999  And then I want you to draft. a email follow-up for when we received the NDA for what happens next, right?  So like an email template that we can use. It's like, thanks so much for sending over the financials. I'm going to review this.  Give me a few days and I'll schedule a call to follow up with you. Right. So then you have kind of the next step signed off by me.  I make sure that you understand what I've just explained to you. So this is a way for you to kind of show me that like, yes, or show me what you understood of what I have brain dumped on you.  And then that way I can like help course correct before you start taking action on the next steps in case I didn't brief you well enough.  So this is like a playback method for me to make sure that I've taught you my understanding of how the process works next.

23:56 - Luke Gillespie (Unrestricted)
  Gotcha. Okay. So I'm going to one, write out my intro. A script for that first beginning interim call with the owner where I explain the whole process and what we do and all that good stuff.  write out that script. Second, then do a bullet point list of my understanding of how the whole process works step by step.  Okay. And then number three, draft that email follow-up for what I would be saying to the owner after they signed the NDA and sent me their financials.

24:25 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Correct.

24:26 - Luke Gillespie (Unrestricted)
  All right. Sounds good.

24:28 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay. And then when you do get the financials, I want you to plug it into the template, write out what you're seeing, and then you and I will get together on another call and go through it and talk about how to approach the next call with the owner.

24:47 - Luke Gillespie (Unrestricted)
  Gotcha.

24:47 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay. Cool. And then you can also listen to my SSS call with Guy. I recorded it, so it's in that one, because he did ask, like, how does this work?  So that'll just give you another. Another form of copy or whatever for, like, kind of understanding how I explain it to owners.

25:06 - Luke Gillespie (Unrestricted)
  Yeah.

25:07 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  But what's really important is you want to be in deference to them. Like, I can do what you do.  Like, what you've built is amazing. You're an awesome business owner. While also establishing your credibility. It's a fine line, right?  And you don't want to be patronizing. So I'll be like, hey, you know, how much do you know about the M&A process?  Would you like me to explain a little bit? Like, I know a lot of people don't necessarily know, but I don't want to assume that, you know, you need some insight from me.  And they'll be like, yeah, why don't you tell me? know, so like, you're always playing that, hey, you're the expert.  You're the business owner. You know what you're doing. I'm just here as a, like, peer to you, right? Yeah, rather than being patronizing to.  And one of the ways that we can come off and be patronizing is by using big words, especially M&A terms, you know, like EBITDA, like most owners don't know what the  that means.  It's not how they run their business. It's not how they budget their business. So what you might be doing is trying to establish your credibility by using these big terms.

26:25 - Luke Gillespie (Unrestricted)
  But actually what it can do is shut them down and come off patronizing or scary because they don't understand what those terms mean.  Yeah, you're right.

26:36 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  I'm not saying you're doing that, but it's just a lesson that I learned a long time ago is like most owners literally have no idea how this process works.  So what we want to do is be their trusted advisor through this process that doesn't make them feel dumb.  Just like we do with our clients, right? Like we're there to hold our clients' hands through it. So it's like, hey, just.  So, you know, I'm paid by the client, but it's really important to me that you feel like you are, you can trust me and you can ask me questions and you understand this process because you're going to be a better fit for my client if you both feel really comfortable and like, you know, what's going on.  So like, it's, it's not a waste of my time. It's, you know, I would love to leave you in a better place.  And even if you don't work with our clients, I would love to, you know, it made me feel good that you feel like you have more information than you had going into this call.  So that's one of the ways I like disarm them a little bit and bring down the defenses, you know, and that's why the personal story and like, you can either use my personal story about my parents, like, hey, our founder, her parents shut down their business and her dad had a heart attack and that he didn't have enough.  Like they don't have enough for retirement now because of that and they could have sold the business. So like, we're all very passionate about making sure that business owners get, you know, what they're rightfully do for building an amazing.  Think business. Whatever, you can try different things, too, and see how it feels because you want it to be authentic.  You want it to be real, whatever part of this process you connect to with them. But so they're not like distrusting of us.  They don't. They're like, wow, these guys are different. They're not like investors that are asking me about and using big words and making me feel like they're going to rip up my business.  Like they actually care. And I feel like I can trust them and ask them questions, and I'm not going to be made to feel dumb.  So the language you use is really important, which is another reason why we script, right? Because we throw around terms like SDE and, you know, stock sale, asset sale.  Like it means nothing, but like they probably don't know what that means. And normally an owner would be with a broker who's going to teach them all of this stuff before they take it to market.

28:56 - Luke Gillespie (Unrestricted)
  Mm-hmm. You're right. Yeah, I get what you're saying. Uh-huh. Yeah, I've learned to get a little bit better than I just a little bit better at that just in the few owner calls I've done.  yeah, I understand kind of keeping things very simple, down to earth, having a very down to earth conversation makes sense.  Yeah. I'm thinking maybe I can.

29:15 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  insulting their intelligence, right? Like they've built multi-million dollar businesses, so they're smart, but running a business is very different than selling a business, you know?

29:25 - Luke Gillespie (Unrestricted)
  So it's just a different skill set, different terms, different ways of the financials. Yeah, exactly. Everyone's smart in their own vertical.  So yeah, yeah.

29:36 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay, cool. What else would be helpful? What other questions do you have about where you're at in the process with a couple of these folks?

29:44 - Luke Gillespie (Unrestricted)
  Yeah. So that was amazing. Thank you so much for explaining all that and talking me through that. Answered most a lot of the questions that I would have asked.  I did write down a few questions.

29:53 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Since I didn't know if you had an agenda, I had wrote down some things that we could talk about and maybe even listen to a call if we had the time.  Thank you. Thank you.

30:00 - Luke Gillespie (Unrestricted)
  Okay, so noted on only asking for the P&Ls because I was trying to be a good boy like you taught me before with the broker calls, always trying to get tax returns.

30:11 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So I was trying to get tax returns from the owners as well. But it makes sense a lot what you're saying.

30:15 - Luke Gillespie (Unrestricted)
  That's a little bit too intimate for after the first call to be asking for tax returns. And actually this one deal where I have the NDA signed, I'm assuming he can get the QuickBooks P&Ls super quickly, but it's the accountant with the tax returns that's holding things up.

30:28 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  He said, my accountant promised me tax returns on Friday. And then I texted, I emailed back on Monday, oh, any updates?  So noted on the tax returns, I was going to ask about that. So now I know just to ask about the P&Ls.  Okay. And then also on the P&Ls, if they haven't filed their tax returns yet for the last year, which they can take until October to do so.  So you can say, hey, it's like, I know that like, it's no big deal if you haven't filed your tax returns yet.  And I know that's Sometimes the P&Ls change when your accountant gets in there and wants to file your taxes.  So it's all good. We understand that. But we're just trying to get a rough idea of like your financial performance so far.  So you want to kind of overcome the objection or the concern they might have, which is it's normal when you work with your accountant on your taxes, you're going to move some things around, right?  Or add some things in. So you just want to be like, it's okay. We know if you haven't filed taxes, some things might change.  We're just looking for overall kind of trends so far. So it's actually more to your benefit to get, you know, as recent as we can, at least last year.  But even better if we can get, you know, quarter one, trailing 12 months. So we can see how they're performing this year.  If that's too much, then just try to get at least 24.

31:52 - Luke Gillespie (Unrestricted)
  Okay. Got it. Yeah.

31:55 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So, yeah, you always want to alleviate concerns. It's like, look, we know these things change. It's all good. For the tax, it's like we, you know, there's a part of the process that we'll inform you about, but it's called seller discretionary earnings.  We would assume that you are doing good tax strategy and you're going to run some things through the business.  It's okay. Like you're not going to get in trouble. There's no auditing here. Um, so if you, when you listen back to the calls with Josanne and Mel, Mel, I'm pretty sure, like I said something to that effect with a lot of them.

32:28 - Luke Gillespie (Unrestricted)
  So, okay. All right. Okay.

32:34 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Cool. Okay. What were your other questions?

32:36 - Luke Gillespie (Unrestricted)
  Yeah. So what I'm finding in the few owner calls I've done a problem and objection that I'm encountering is these owners.  They're sometimes out in the field, you know, they're calling me in the truck from one job site to another job site.  And I can just get the vibe, get the feeling on the call. They really want this to go quickly and they want to hang up quick.  They don't really want me to be dragging out this conversation. Uh, maybe this is what you would call reverse tire.  But I get the sense from these owners that they just want the call to go quick, just a quick 15-minute call.  So, so far, my strategy when I've been getting that feeling has just been to establish some rapport and really just get out the immediate deal breakers and then just get them to agree to an NDA as soon as possible, then hang up and send them the NDA over email, like in a 15-minute call, because that's just where I was getting the feeling that these owners want to get the call done quickly and hang up.  So how do you feel about that when you've encountered that before? you think that's just me being nervous?

33:32 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Am I just projecting that onto myself? Or do you think this is an actual problem? What are your thoughts?  What do you perceive as the immediate deal breakers?

33:44 - Luke Gillespie (Unrestricted)
  So I was talking to this guy on the roofing company, and he immediately got out the deal breaker saying that he's okay to qualify his license.  He's clearly very willing to see an offer. He kept saying, yeah, I just want to see an offer. You know, these owners, they just want to see an offer really quick.  Basically, they don't necessarily understand the whole process it's going to take. And then the most immediate deal breakers would just be the numbers, making sure that they're profitable, getting a rough image of their revenue net income to see if it would be cash flowing enough potentially for our client.  This one was for DL. So he told me what the net income was around. And I thought, OK, maybe that could work to me.  In my head, was like, OK, immediate deal breakers out of the way. He's interested, licensed good numbers sounding like they could be OK.  Let's move on to an NDA and get the financials.

34:40 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So the net income tells you zero. Yeah. So like if if they if you start getting into the financials on the first call, then you're not getting.  The full picture of their story, why they're selling. Why they started the business, how they operate in the business, build that rapport, get them telling their story.  I never get into the financials on the first call. And so one of the things that you can do in that opening, so I get that a lot on the sales calls.  People are like, well, how much? And it's like, well, we're a white glove concierge service. So I need to understand your situation more before I give you pricing.  We'll do that on the next call. So I want you to write that into the script. Like, hey, we're not going to talk valuation or numbers on this call.  I would be doing you a disservice if I did. So we're going to go on a process of getting to know each other and getting comfortable with each other and getting more information at different stages.  Here's what that process looks like. So we're not going to discuss evaluation on this call. So then you cover it off right at the beginning.  Right. And it's like, how long did it take you to build your business? You know, if they're like, well, I just want to know how much my...  Business is worth. How much, how long did it take you to build your business? 20 years. And you want me to tell you what it's worth in 15 minutes?

36:07 - Luke Gillespie (Unrestricted)
  Yeah.

36:08 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Right. So there's a part in the course on the sales course around handling.

36:17 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  It would be very good for you to watch and listen to.

36:20 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So even though it's sales related, it gives you some ideas on how to boggle weave and how to handle objections.  Because like you want us, you want to maintain. Control of the call. You want to do it on broker calls.  You want to do it on owner calls. And one of the best ways we can maintain control is by establishing the ground rules and the expectations at the very start.  That's why you establish the frame. Before they get on the call, you can be. So this is the things that we need to be sending them before the call.  What to expect on the call. And there's a difference between jumping on and doing the vetting questions and actually having that first owner call.

36:58 - Luke Gillespie (Unrestricted)
  Those are not the same call. Exactly. Exactly. Yeah.

37:00 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Right. So we need to establish like, okay, well, if they didn't answer the vetting questions on email, then you're going to have a different script and different questions on the initial call than you will establishing like the real first call with the owner.  So vetting questions is like you're setting, you're setting the call. So it would be like, hey, thank you so much for responding.  I have a few quick questions. We're not going to discuss valuation or anything today. Okay. So if, if these, if you answer the questions in a way that sounds like it's worth both of our time to proceed, I'm going to set a call time with you where I need you to be like able to kind of sit in one place for 45 minutes, answer some calls so I can get the information I need.  And also for you to feel comfortable moving forward on this process with us.

37:51 - Luke Gillespie (Unrestricted)
  Oh. Okay.

37:53 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  And before the call, it's like, you know, sending some information, you can do it over text message also. So, so we do this with the sales.  So we, they know what to expect. We assign them homework to watch videos. Like we're going to be incorporating all this into this process.  But for now, what you need to do is just handle the objections and just let them know where they are in the process.  That in itself will kill a lot of the, it's like, well, if you're serious about selling your business, I would feel very uncomfortable with anybody that's willing to give you a valuation in a 15 minute conversation.

38:28 - Luke Gillespie (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, true.

38:30 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Right? Like, so I can't give you a number because there's so many variables that go into evaluation, but I'm going to teach you how this process works, right?  Like I'm going to, like, we're going to get that information from you and walk down this path together if you feel comfortable.  But, you know, if you're just looking for a quick number, I wouldn't feel comfortable doing that because it wouldn't do any justice.

38:56 - Luke Gillespie (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, yeah, that's a good point. Yeah, that's a good line. you.

38:59 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Thank you. Thank Thank Thank Thank Thank So do you have favorite reach out to Anka for the, or actually, do you have access to the whole course?  Can you see, like, you can see the whole classroom, right?

39:11 - Luke Gillespie (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, I got, like, halfway through the, I did the cold email one weeks ago already that you told us yesterday, and I got, like, halfway through the setter one.
  ACTION ITEM: Review "Objections" section in sales course - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/292841222?timestamp=2358.9999  Yeah, the setting one, and that's about all I got to.

39:29 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Um, okay, there's a whole thing on objections.

39:39 - Luke Gillespie (Unrestricted)
  Uh-huh. I don't think I have access to it.

39:47 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Um, if you can get into the course, you should be able to.

39:51 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So let me—do you have the login information?

39:51 - Luke Gillespie (Unrestricted)
  Yeah.

39:51 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay, see if you can access that link.

39:58 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Out.

40:00 - Luke Gillespie (Unrestricted)
  Okay. I'll click join group. It says locked private right now, but there's a join group.

40:16 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)

  Send me the link to the, oh yeah, there we go. Send me the, where are you logging in to review the email marketing?
  SCREEN SHARING: Luke started screen sharing - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/292841222?timestamp=2440.341065

40:45 - Luke Gillespie (Unrestricted)
  Anka sent us this Google Doc right here and then I just click one of these links. I just click that link and it works for me.

40:57 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay. Cause it's in seven figures selling. got me. That's why. Okay. Okay. Do One sec. Okay, classroom. Objections, here we go.  Okay, try that one.

41:33 - Luke Gillespie (Unrestricted)
  All right. Objections.

41:39 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah. That will be really good for you to go through. So I'd say start working through that because you'll start recognizing, even though this is about sales, you'll start recognizing objections, right?  Oh, I need to talk to my wife before I do this, right?

41:59 - Luke Gillespie (Unrestricted)
  Like, I need talk to talk Oh, what does the money cost for this?

42:03 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So these are tools that you're going to be able to use both in broker and owner calls. And objection handling is by far one of the hardest skills for me to learn.
  ACTION ITEM: Start Google Doc tracking broker/owner objections - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/292841222?timestamp=2528.9999  It's one I still have to work on. Do me a favor. Every time you get an objection from a broker or an owner, want you to start a Google Doc and just write out what the objections are.

42:30 - Luke Gillespie (Unrestricted)
  Okay.

42:31 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Because what we're going to need to do is extract how you handle those objections, extract how I handle those objections.  So that's part of the training with a new person coming in to do broker calls or owner calls is like, you're going to get these objections.  Here's how to respond to them. And so it gets people off the block that much quicker. So rather than having to learn it from scratch every time, right?  Because Ryan knew all the objection handling, right?

43:00 - Luke Gillespie (Unrestricted)
  And that's how he told me.

43:02 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  But we'd rather have it all in one place so we can just train someone on it and they can have it open when it comes up rather than having it going back to you and being like, look, how do I do this?  Right. So, yeah, just start writing. You don't need to write the answers to the objections, but just write common objections in a doc for owner and broker calls.  You can do it in the playbook, actually, for the off-market, if you wanted to start making a list of objections in another tab or something.  So that we can start, like when you're getting those, then you and I can talk about it, but we can also write the answers so that anybody else that comes in, which we're going to need, right?  It's not possible for you and I to do all the owner calls when we start cracking this and getting a  ton of people coming through.

43:55 - Luke Gillespie (Unrestricted)
  Yeah. Makes sense? Yep. I already started my list. I got some in my head. I know already.

44:01 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Right. Yeah. I mean, and I know the common ones too. It's like, well, how much is my business worth?  And it's like, well, you know, that's my response is like, how long, how long did it take you to start to, you know, like how long have you been running your business?  Oh, 20 years. And like, so you want me to tell you what it's worth in 15 minutes?

44:19 - Luke Gillespie (Unrestricted)
  Yeah.

44:20 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Wow. I was like, okay, well, what would be important to you at this stage of the process to know?  Like, what do you need to be comfortable with? Right. So objection handling is asking thoughtful questions. That's all it is, is just asking thoughtful questions, getting people to arrive at the answer that you want them to get to.

44:40 - Luke Gillespie (Unrestricted)
  Yeah.

44:40 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Because if you're answering the question, you're no longer in control.

44:46 - Luke Gillespie (Unrestricted)
  True. Yeah.

44:49 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Cool. Good. How are you feeling?

44:53 - Luke Gillespie (Unrestricted)
  Good. Excited. A lot of work to do. What exciting.

44:56 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah. You're doing great. And I love that you were up for this. So it's an opportunity. For us to work closer together and actually get some processes written down, which has been my dream for a year.

45:08 - Luke Gillespie (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, it's exciting. I'm excited to nail this off-market with you.

45:12 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, the whole, like, how was yesterday for you?

45:16 - Luke Gillespie (Unrestricted)
  It was good. Yeah, it was exciting. Talking about things. That was just the intro call. We haven't even deep dived yet, so.

45:23 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Well, we're going to do that at, like, every part of the process, but when it comes together, it's going to be like, wow, we built that, you know, like.

45:33 - Luke Gillespie (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, yeah.

45:35 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  What people are paying for is that, like, we are putting this many minds to building a process that works, and we're going to be able to scale by bringing in more people and teaching them this process that works so that we can service more clients.

45:49 - Luke Gillespie (Unrestricted)
  Because I don't want any client to feel the effect of us bringing in more clients, you know? Yeah. Uh-huh.  Yeah. We're going to do good.

45:59 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Oh, yeah. I'm excited. Okay. Are you feeling in a good place then?

46:03 - Luke Gillespie (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, I'm confident. know what to do.

46:05 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Great. So we'll schedule some more time to follow up on this stuff. Probably, you know, next week, depending on where you get to with these owner calls and everything.  So just keep me posted on like what happens and when you start getting some movement, and then we'll schedule some time to go through what happens next.

46:24 - Luke Gillespie (Unrestricted)
  Sounds good. All right.

46:26 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  And then when do you think you can get the script and the things we talked about today? Like what is a reasonable timeline for you to get stuff done?

46:37 - Luke Gillespie (Unrestricted)
  I mean, reasonably, I was hoping we could keep it on the same timeline as all the other off-market stuff end of the week, like end of day Friday.

46:44 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Great. Perfect. Sounds good.

46:46 - Luke Gillespie (Unrestricted)
  Cool. Yeah, that's very doable for me.

46:49 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay. Excellent.

46:50 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Thanks, Luke.

46:50 - Luke Gillespie (Unrestricted)
  All right. Cool. Thanks a lot for taking the time. appreciate the training. The coaching.

46:57 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  I am more than happy to do it. It's a great investment. I love how up you are for new challenges, too.  So thanks for a positive attitude and rolling up your sleeves and diving in.

47:07 - Luke Gillespie (Unrestricted)
  Always.

47:09 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Awesome. Well, I'll see you in a couple hours.

47:11 - Luke Gillespie (Unrestricted)
  Yeah. All right. Thanks. Bye.

47:14 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Bye.
