[00:00:00]
Anke Jordaan: So I'm guessing it might've been your meeting. I don't know.

[00:00:10]
Athena Simpson: Okay. Oh, wait, wait.

[00:00:13]
Anke Jordaan: Wasn't it that I pulled your personal meeting room invite for these meetings? I think that's what that was. Maybe not. I don't know. Okay.

[00:03:19]
Athena Simpson: Well, so we've actually, we're not going to spend two whole hours on broker calls. There's quite a few things wanted to go through with you all. I think it might be worth, Anke, first just touching on the first write-up process and making sure we're all on the same page there and that's cleaned up.

[00:03:38]
Anke Jordaan: So do you want to talk that through real quick? Sure. So we have two different processes that the clients go through. It's a very detailed step when they get their first write-up because we have to set them up for success in terms of exactly what it is they have to do, what we're expecting from them, and then most importantly, how to actually benefit from the write-up, how to view the information, and then what exactly happens after the write-up. So in the past, we've seen clients can get a bit disoriented if they don't know what the exact steps is that they should take. Also, the first time that they have to sign an NDA or fill in a buyer profile is extremely scary for them. So it really helps if we take them through step by step. So essentially, that's what the first write-up process is, is an entire, I think it's like a 10-step process that the clients, a document that they have of the exact steps that needs to happen when they get their first write-up. From there on, every follow-up write-up is essentially just like the second half of this entire thing where they just do the same thing over and over again. It's not as much hand-holding in the beginning like we have to do for their first write-up. that we see can. You Um, so yeah, I think anything else you want to say on that? Or do you want me to share my screen and we can take a look at the actual document?

[00:05:10]
Athena Simpson: No, I think you did a good job. So, um, you know, we just had Peter go through, like, he's our newest client, and he just kerfuffled himself all over the place, which is why we ended up like saying, okay, we need to like, do this process. Um, so signposting for clients and like, you know, handholding them through these steps without making it seem patronizing is part of what, um, I think gives it that white glove concierge experience for them. It's like, okay, first time, let's go, let's do this together. Um, so we'll go through the steps in a moment, but I think it's important to familiarize yourself with the nuances of whatever they're going to be signing or needing to do before you jump on that call with them too, because like every NDA is different. Every buyer profile is different. So I don't know if that's in our internal process document, Anke, but I think it's going to be really important because they're all just different. Since you guys aren't signing the NDAs or buyer profiles yourself, but you're going to be the one doing that call, you want to make sure that you know how it should be filled out before you jump on the call with them. Cool. Yeah, you can go ahead and share, go through the steps.
SCREEN SHARING: Anke started screen sharing - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/378743843?timestamp=397.707859

[00:06:33]
Anke Jordaan: Okay, perfect. Okay, so I mean, you guys all have seen this document. So this is just an introduction that we gave them in terms of, you know, the roadmap for evaluating deals. Just explaining to them that this is practice. Everything they do, each and every step they take, it's all about practice. And so. So the first write-up step essentially starts with them having to actually thoroughly read through this document. So all of the new clients have received this document to go through. The second step is they're going to sign the NDA and buyer profile on a call with you and then review how to use a write-up. So that's what Athena was just saying. Like the deal flow coordinators essentially signed that NDA and buyer profile, right? When they got the SIM in front of you guys. So you guys need to familiarize yourself with what that NDA and buyer profile looks like, how you're going to fill it in before you get on a call with them. So there's two documents here. The one says, let's sign an NDA. And then the other one says, let's complete a buyer profile. And essentially it takes the client through the entire, you know, FAQ of what an NDA is, why they need to sign it, what's the purpose. What are they committing to? Just explaining to them that, yes, it is a very serious legal document that they do have to go through in detail so that they know what they're signing, but also just knowing that this is not, they're not signing an LOI, they're not signing an APA, this is just an NDA to get the information so that it doesn't feel as scary for them. At the bottom, what we did is we actually, Ida actually signed a sample NDA, which she filled in a sample NDA with our sample profile, Samantha Doe, to see exactly what it looks like to sign an NDA. Same thing then for the buyer profile as well. So it's a bunch of FAQs on what the buyer profile is, what information they need to fill in, and then she actually filled in a buyer profile using Samantha Doe, which is our sample client, Samantha Doe's information. So um, in, in, in this buyer profile.

[00:09:03]
Athena Simpson: Hey Anke, um, do we have an internal process for this? Yes.

[00:09:11]
Anke Jordaan: I, I, I started mapping out a playbook last night for an internal process for this.

[00:09:16]
Athena Simpson: Okay. I think it's going to be important, like rather than talking through what the clients are doing, like what's important for us on each of these touch points.

[00:09:26]
Anke Jordaan: Okay. So let me pull that document up then.

[00:09:30]
Ryan Cash: Hey, uh, this buyer profile form. Is this something that's like standard or I've just never seen this form before. What's the use for this?

[00:09:40]
Athena Simpson: So brokers are basically gatekeeping. They get like hundreds of inquiries on deals right now. So they want to see who the, first of all, this is their CRM system is like getting this document filled out about people. And then second of all, they use it to screen. So that's why it's important that we fill it out well, because they can end up, like, preventing them from moving forward. So, Anke. It's like a low-budget version of, like, our webpages that we make for the clients.

[00:10:16]
Ryan Cash: Like, we have these detailed buyer profiles with, like, all these details and stuff. It seems like it's a lot of the same information.

[00:10:24]
Athena Simpson: Yeah, they use it to decide whether they think someone's qualified or not, you know? So they'll use it as a tool to, like, prevent people from moving forward in the next stage before they share, you know, SIM and details and that sort of thing. So we've already gotten through the gatekeeper if we have a write-up for them. So it's less, you know, important for them to fill it out in a way to, like, get rejected.
ACTION ITEM: Arrange Ida training on buyer profiles/NDAs for Cash & Charis
- WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/378743843?timestamp=655.9999
But more, like, we want them to put as little information as possible so they don't overshare. And end up doing something that could, like, you know, raise a red flag or whatever. Yeah, got you. I think it might be worth doing some more buyer profile training with Ida and Ray. If these guys are going to be running the first call so that they feel confident in how to answer that. Okay.

[00:11:25]
Anke Jordaan: Got it.

[00:11:29]
Ryan Cash: All right.
SCREEN SHARING: Anke started screen sharing - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/378743843?timestamp=693.509083

[00:11:29]
Anke Jordaan: So let me just then pull up my screen to this. So just so you know, guys, know where this is. In the normal on-market playbook in write-ups, there's a playbook that says first write-up internal playbook. So this is essentially what our steps is and what we need to know and think about and plan out as the clients have their client-facing side document, which I linked in here. So the first one is I added the call that Athena had with Peter Jackson, where she essentially went through this entire thing as a video here. And then in the step-by-step, when the write-up is ready, so the first thing is the analyst sends the client the message, the template is listed below. So let me just scroll down to that. Essentially, it's just telling them, you know, your write-up is ready, what a write-up is, and then just what they should be expecting on the call. You know, we're going to be filling in the NDA and buyer profile, and then we're going to navigate how to utilize a write-up. Just telling them what they can prepare us, making sure that they go through this document, especially those two documents, and then booking the call. So that's the template for sending out the first write-up to the client so they know this is coming.

[00:12:51]
Athena Simpson: Anke, go back, please. Is there a reason we're not using booking links for this?

[00:12:59]
Anke Jordaan: I just added, as part of the template, the booking link placeholder.

[00:13:05]
Athena Simpson: Okay. So the template you sent Luke yesterday just said, would you be available at insert time?

[00:13:10]
Anke Jordaan: I can add that as part of the tech setup that we need to do. But yeah, I think a booking link is much better because it gives the client a bit more flexibility on, you know, having to choose a time that works for them.
ACTION ITEM: Train team on setting up booking links (5-10 min)
- WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/378743843?timestamp=805.9999
So let me just remove this and say only booking link.
ACTION ITEM: Update first write-up internal playbook w/ booking links info
- WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/378743843?timestamp=805.9999

[00:13:36]
Athena Simpson: Yeah. Okay. So let's maybe at the end of this call, spend some time, like you can do that with them. How long do you need to train them on booking links?

[00:13:50]
Anke Jordaan: Five, 10 minutes. Okay.

[00:13:52]
Athena Simpson: Yeah. So guys, I, you know, always thinking through, like, how do we make it? This is part of the client servicing stuff. Thank Like I don't do as I do with the clients because my time is so absolutely limited and I'm not meant to be client facing right now. So me just giving them like a one time that I'm available thing is not ideal. What we want to do is, you know, set times that make sense for you, that would work for you, but giving them the option to just kind of schedule it themselves rather than doing that back and forth thing. Um, also we might have a sense of urgency about it, but they don't, they have day jobs, that sort of thing. So we used to do this thing where we're like, are you available tomorrow? And they were like, ah, so we kind of want to give them a few options. Right. But like, um, with the first write up, cause it's our first one, the time sensitivity isn't as important. It's unlikely the very first one is going to be the one they go under offer on. It's like, they're learning the process, that sort of thing. Um, we can ramp up the sense of urgency as they get. now? to Let's A little bit more comfortable. So hopefully that nuance makes sense. Initially, you know, we want to give them some times if it's during the day they're having to move around work meetings or like pretend like they, you know, have some sort of thing going on during the day. So like springing in on them last minute kind of sucks for them. So that's why I prefer booking links and a couple options that's not necessarily like same day, next day.

[00:15:27]
Anke Jordaan: That makes sense?

[00:15:29]
Athena Simpson: Cool. Cool.

[00:15:32]
Anke Jordaan: Cool. So, you know, after the meeting is booked, I added in here the NDA and buyer profile call is to familiarize yourself with the NDA and buyer profile for this deal, how to fill it in before getting on a call with a client. You know, scheduling a call with a client, walking them through the NDA, completing the buyer profile. So having them screen share as you talk them through it. And then the next step is explaining how to read and use a write-up. Essentially, let me just add in how to access all the information. So just showing them that when you click on this link, it opens up the SIM. When you click on this link, it opens up the broker call. This is the video that you need to watch first. And then book the write-up review call within 48 hours, and then don't send them the write-up without booking the call.

[00:16:34]
Charis Siau: Are you able to show us just some insight on the buyer profile? Like, what does that look like where they're completing the buyer profile?

[00:16:56]
Athena Simpson: So, Charis, can you explain your question a little bit more? I'm not sure I understood it.

[00:17:01]
Charis Siau: Yeah. So we're supposed to walk them through completing the buyer profile. So what does that look like on their end exactly of completing the buyer profile? Is there like, is it just like a questionnaire that I'm in?

[00:17:17]
Ryan Cash: The broker typically like send them their unique buyer profile? Or is this just like generic? It's going to look something like this.

[00:17:26]
Anke Jordaan: This is a very generic buyer profiles. All of them basically looks the same. It's going to ask them for some details in terms of have they owned a business before? What's their training and skills? What's their work experience? You know, and then usually it will ask them for some specific numbers to see if they are qualified to actually be able to afford this business and then having that sign. So that is what is typically accompanied by an NDA is a buyer profile. Not all brokers ask for buyer profiles. Some brokers just have you sign an NDA, but there are some that the NDA is accompanied with a buyer profile.

[00:18:06]
Charis Siau: Oh, so this is separate from their web profile that we have on them on the AcquiMatch website? This is not related at all? No.

[00:18:19]
Anke Jordaan: Okay. No.

[00:18:22]
Athena Simpson: So we look for deals, oftentimes in order to get this SIM, you have to sign an NDA and fill out one of these documents.

[00:18:32]
Charis Siau: Okay.

[00:18:33]
Athena Simpson: So then when we hand it over to the client, we have to have them do the same and we want to take them through this process. But what I just asked Anka earlier was to actually get you guys some training with Ida on this. And Anka, I think for Charis and Cash, and I think Luke's comfortable with it. But if Luke wants it to have Ida join these first write-up calls, if there's a buyer profile and, and like, let's say the first write-ups. We have NDAs. You guys will need to jump on a call with the client whenever the first buyer profile for a new client pops up so they understand how to fill this out. But we'll get you some more training, Charis, with Ida. And then I think let's have Ida accompany it. She's filled out probably thousands of these by now. But it is something the broker requires in order for us to get access to the deal.

[00:19:25]
Charis Siau: OK, got it. Yeah, I think I was confused a bit with the name of using buyer profile on these forms and then what we have on the internally and public facing on the website as well. So, OK, cool. Can we go back to the first write up?

[00:19:42]
Anke Jordaan: Internal or client facing? Internal.

[00:19:46]
Athena Simpson: So that video that Anke put with me and Peter, it's important to watch that while we build out the actual situation. It's by step. It's a little light. So let me give you guys some context. Um. So when you're getting on this call, you're kind of also doing a tech check with them to make sure that they know how to sign an NDA. So Anke, you need to add that stuff in here, right, of like getting up Adobe PDF, showing them how to sign it. They can sign it for free. It doesn't need to be a paid thing. But just making sure, like we just realized Dustin and Lindsey were printing out all of their NDAs, signing it, scanning it, and sending it. Yeah, so that's why we were like, oh, we need to actually get ahead of that because what's common sense to us, you know, they think it's an important document and that they need to ink sign it. So they were doing what they thought was the right thing. So that's why it's a good white glove concierge experience to be like, okay, here's your first one. Here's what you need to do. You don't need to ink sign. Let's get Adobe up to make sure that you can actually sign the thing. Here's a buyer profile. It looks a little bit intimidating, but you've got your PFS statement. So Anke, they need a little bit more detail in terms of that's pinned to the client's channel. If it's not, we need to clean up and make sure that it's pinned to all of the channels. That's something Ida can do. But the amounts of money in that buyer profile, for example, will be in the personal financial statement that they've already filled out for us that's pinned to their channel. So then it's just showing them how easy it is. It's like, okay, now we're going to go to your Slack channel. Your PFS statement's already pinned there. So all you need to do is just pull the amounts from that into this document. So you don't need to like go and look at all your bank accounts again, right? Just reminding them that this isn't, we've tried to set this up to be as easy as possible. Then when it's like asking for work education and stuff, it's like telling them it's okay to just say, hey, can you please go check out my buyer profile with all this information? So, and put the link in there to their AcquiMatch buyer profile. The one that we made for them, because that usually is much more comprehensive than what the broker is asking for. And it saves the client having to type it up from scratch every time. But if we don't tell them that, they will type it up from scratch every time and it's a big old pain in the . Um, so let's beef this out more, Anke, with like the internal whys so that when they get on calls and then have Ida on that. The explaining how to read and use a write-up is not just the how-to. It's the things that I do with you guys. It's a contextual, like, why do we do this? Why have we set it out this way? Where is it important for them to start? Um, you know, making sure that they understand, like, hey, this video is like your preview to the deal. It's really important that you watch this first because there's going to be nuance and context that is not in the rest of the write-up. So start here, right? So it's just... Finding them. And I just showed them for an hour and told them that. So it's important to like reiterate it again. Like this is, this is the place that you start here. Then go through and read everything. Then if you're interested, dive in a little bit deeper and watch the broker call or listen to the broker calls, start diving into the SIM. So if we don't tell them the order in which and why to do things, then they'll just start, you know, jumping all over the place and, you know, skipping the videos. And we actually started putting the videos in place because they would like scan the write up and then want to reject the deal. And we're like, wait, wait, wait, there's so much here. So you guys are kind of selling, right? Like they're sitting there like this is risking my entire livelihood and family and everything. So their default mode is to reject, reject, reject. Even if they don't think that they're in that mindset, they'll find reasons in there that it doesn't work. So something that I would like, you know. On the weekly calls with the clients, you know, and as we start getting these like scorecards in place is to just find out what their like absolute deal breakers are. And if it's not one of those, then they shouldn't be rejecting the deal. So that's the other really big thing that we're managing the client's expectations on is this isn't just looking at deals, it's getting your reps in. So you we do not want you to stop working a deal until you've tried to get access to the owner. Because getting you learning to get through the broker to get access to the owner is a skill. And we need you to practice every single deal we put in front of you. So this is as much looking for opportunities that are a good fit for you as also getting your reps in. And if you do not take the opportunity to speak to the brokers and owners, you're denying yourself a rep every single time, which is going to cost you when you find the deal you like, right? If If If have that experience, if you don't have the ability to get the broker on side and ask the right questions to get through to the owner and start developing a rapport and, you know, having that relationship, then when you do find the one, you're going to be at a disadvantage. So we've, you know, we're saying our legacy clients have gotten in the habit of being able to reject deals before broker calls, but any of the new clients, the ones that just started, the ones that are starting in the future, we are making the strong recommendation that they at least take the opportunity to speak to the broker and the owner on every single deal, because they probably won't get access to the owner on the first couple because they don't have enough experience and gravitas to make themselves feel like the chosen buyer, right? So we need them to get that experience in because we've had clients lose deals that they were really excited about because they didn't have enough experience with this stuff. So you guys are also the guide in that sense of, hey, like every deal I put in front of you. We're going to be moving to broker call. Does that make sense? Any questions on that? Good. Okay. So then the other thing that's important to do on that call is you're going to be showing them the why of the write-up and the components and not really pressuring them to make a decision on the call. So you're going to say, I'm going to leave you with the write-up. We're going to schedule a follow-up call right now to go through your broker questions and get you ready for that broker call. So you're going to schedule the call on the call with them. And they do not get the write-up without booking that follow-up call. So it's like they don't even have the choice then of whether they're having the broker call. They just need to get prepared for it and do the preparations for that. So on this call, you also also want to... Remind them, like, here's the broker questions, documents, and preparation. I want you to go through and pick out what your questions are about this deal. We're going to prepare your talk track on the next call.

[00:27:16]
Anke Jordaan: Okay, so I'll build out everything we just spoke about. I did drop it in here, but I'll just pull it out so it's a bit more, makes a bit more sense in terms, I just added it in as NDA and buyer profile tips to tell the client, you know. So just some of these nuances. This is essentially what you said, Athena, in terms of always watch the Loom video first, you know, review and respond 24 hours. These are just some of the nuances things that we can tell them. How to review the deal.

[00:27:50]
Athena Simpson: Oh, this is really important, too. As you guys are learning the stages, but, you know, the first thing that is most. Most important for them to think about, they'll get in the weeds of like, what's the working cap? They said inventory is separate. Like Peter's been spinning himself out on the inventory thing. And there's literally no way to figure out the inventory until you're actually into due diligence. So we can make some like, you know, assumptions. And if he were to make an offer, we'd want to get, you know, working capital included. But they'll like, Peter for sure is like getting so bogged down in the details before actually just getting on a call and seeing if he likes the business and likes the owner. So really, for me, it's like, if you think of the stages of dating, the first broker call is like, you know, meeting their matchmaker almost, you know, like, can you tell me more about them? And like, you know, and then the first owner call is like, a blind date. And do I like this person? And do I want to continue dating? This person to find out more about them. We really want them thinking that way with businesses. It depends on the urgency of the deal, how many offers they're in, how quickly it's going to go, that sort of thing. We might need to like speed up the, you know, it might need to be an arranged marriage kind of situation. But if we're acting from default, then we just need to slow them down and be like, hey, all I need you to do on that first owner call is have some questions, get to know this person, develop some rapport, because if they like you, the rest of this process is going to be a lot easier. If you like them, then this is someone you could potentially see yourself working with for the next 12 to 24 months, right? Like this isn't just by a business relationship over with the owner. It's a long-term relationship that they're getting into with this person. And if they don't even like each other on the first call, you know, probably not a good match because the owner. Built the business in their image. And like I said, there's, so we really want to kind of like just reframe them. And like this says, like, it's like, do I see myself in this business? Do I like this person? You know, do I like the owner? Do I think I could learn from them? Because they will, they will get pretty deep into, ah, there's all this thing. So the other big thing that we always say a lot is verify any assumptions. So they will make a whole bunch of assumptions about the deal. Oh, I see the owners working all the time. And it's like, well, do you know if they have to, or are they choosing to? Because a lot of boomers, they can't see themselves doing anything but work, right? That's their identity. So they're choosing to do that many hours when they don't necessarily need to. And they wear it as a badge of honor that they do payroll and they do admin and they do this and they do that and they do all of these things. And, and, and. And, you know, you could easily outsource that stuff as a new owner. So when they're like, well, they're working so much, it's like, what are, do you know what they're working on? Do you know if they have to be working on all that stuff? Let's, let's get on a call with them and actually verify those assumptions, right? So they'll make assumptions about the deal because they'll want to, they'll want to kill it for these assumptions. But unless it's like explicitly written in the SIM somewhere, it's like, okay, cool. That's a great question. Let's put that down and have you actually verify that with the broker or the owner. Does that make sense? so we're always coaching them to kind of take the next step. And also at this stage, the, the only risk that they have is that they learn, they get more experience, you know? Cash, do you have a question? No, I'm good.

[00:31:50]
Ryan Cash: That was, uh, that was really helpful. Cool.

[00:31:53]
Athena Simpson: Awesome. Okay.

[00:31:56]
Anke Jordaan: Then after that, if that call's completed, they, And you send them their write-up. The actual steps in how to send a write-up is in the write-up playbook. And then you can follow up with them for their broker questions before your write-up review call. So they, in their guide, they get the action that says, let me just zoom in a bit for you guys. When they receive their first write-up, they will go through the broker questions document and then select 10 questions that they would like to use to explore further on. They're going to send those questions to you. And then you're going to review those questions with them on the call, setting up their track. And then you're going to review the write-up in full detail with them, discussing their questions and concerns, strategizing for the broker call. And this is in the write-up review call. Yeah. then, so just finalize the broker questions and then confirm. So confirming that the client is ready for the broker intro, then you can make the broker introduction. Let me see if I added that as, yeah, then we can make the broker introduction. So you'll send the broker introduction, the steps on how to do a broker introduction is in this playbook. And then just, you know, urging the clients to schedule a broker call within 24 hours of making the introduction and reminding them to always keep you in CC of the broker email thread. So you can stay in the loop of what's going on on that deal.

[00:33:32]
Athena Simpson: After the call, something important on the CCing is that when you tell them to do that, be like, we're not going to have, like, I'm just going to keep an eye on things. I won't jump into the conversation. All of our conversations will happen on Slack. It's just good for me to see if there's anything there that I need to do because I have that previous relationship with the broker. Whatever, um, what clients can sometimes do because. It's, yeah. Like email is their default communication is they'll start communicating with you there. If they do that, if they DM you, if they use a channel that's not like the main like client Slack channel, just forward the message to the main Slack channel and respond to them there and tag them. Because if you respond to them in the mode that they communicated with you with on, we're going to train them that we respond there. So that's just a little client management tool, but they might DM you about something or they might like email you like, what do you think about this? Forward that message to the channel. And then it's not even mine.

[00:34:40]
Anke Jordaan: It's going to, they're definitely going to, they all do this. They're definitely going to email you or DM you.

[00:34:45]
Athena Simpson: Right. You know, it's, it's, it's, they're probably wanting to save people from like being in conversations and I just forward it. And it's like, Hey, it's really helpful for the whole team to be up to speed on the conversation. I'm going to respond to you here. Thank But if you respond to them in the DMs, if you respond to them in email, then we're training them that we will also respond to there. So early training of where it is that we respond to them. So again, everything with us, how we operate, all of that is new. Some of them have never used Slack before. So, you know, just signposting them into where to go is helpful.

[00:35:30]
Anke Jordaan: Okay, then after the client attends the broker call, they have instructions in their first round of documents to send a debrief in Slack and essentially give you the information. Let me just tell you what they want to send. Essentially tell you the information, post feedback, tell you what happened. How did the call go? You know, what questions were answered? What did they learn that wasn't in the SIM? Their takeaways, their concerns, and then was there... Any next steps that was agreed upon with the broker. So they're going to be sending that to you in Slack as the debrief in Slack. And then that's where you can then jump in and further advise and support there.

[00:36:14]
Athena Simpson: So on that note too, on the call, when you're doing the prep, like, so I would tell them what comes next on the write-up call. So, you know, just like always kind of knowing where they are in the process. So on the first write-up call, it's like, okay, I'm going to send you the write-up. You're going to review that, prep your questions. We're going to get on a call and get you ready. And then after that, you're going to have a broker call. After you have the broker call, you're going to send us feedback in Slack. And then again, on the write-up call, where you're actually going through the write-up and the broker questions, like, okay, so I'm going to send an email. Introduce you to the broker. You're going to schedule a call. Let me know when that is after your call. I want you to send feedback in the Slack channel so we know what happened, right? So like just reminding them what they need to do. And then when you tell them to give feedback in Slack, this has been so helpful and it can't be stated enough, but like just teaching them that they can leave voice notes and they can do screen shares in Slack. Like Gil in particular thinks he needs to do phone calls all the time, like anytime anything comes up. And while he's not wrong to want support, he's more than capable of you. And so we've been, I've been training him like, it's okay, just leave a voice note, leave a video, like we'll be able to communicate this way and I'll get you your answer more quickly that way. If we do it, async is the term, right? Like we're not on a call in real time, but we'll be able to communicate with each other. But when I've told the clients and I'll even show it. to them on a screen share how to do a voice note and how to do a video share. And I'm like, this, this saves you having to type it out. Like if you're just like, I don't want to type it out, you can do it on your phone, leave a voice note for me. It's super easy. And they've been really excited once they like figure out that they can do that. Because then after a broker call, they can just get on, you know, on their phone, leave a voice note, here's what happened, blah, blah, blah. Because I don't know about you guys, but after a full day of work, I don't want to type up. a whole play by play of what happened. So oftentimes it could, if we give them multiple ways to communicate with us and Slack automatically transcribes it anyway. So you can just read the note. Um, sometimes if, if there's stuff in there, I'll, I'll listen to it, but you can read it really quickly and get a, an update on what happened. Cash, you have a question?

[00:38:55]
Ryan Cash: No, I was just going to say, like, I haven't seen any of those with my clients yet, but like, if, if, if. The Client Milestones channel has been throwing a lot of those voice notes and stuff, updates. So, I don't know. It's been cool to see some of the, like, feedback and ways the clients are engaging with the system. Yeah.

[00:39:15]
Athena Simpson: It's so much better. I mean, like, them trying to find, everybody trying to find time for a phone call, and it's probably just a quick conversation, ends up being better. So, we can train them, like, with our existing clients, we didn't do a good job of training them up front. So, they just got used to being able to schedule a call whenever they wanted. And when I jumped back in the kitchen, I've been training them out of that. So, with the new ones, we can train them in the way that we want them to behave. And when I say train, like, they're not, it's not a patronizing thing, right? Like, they just don't know how we operate. So, we have the opportunity to be, like, here's how to get the most out of us, right? Here's how to make it easy on yourself. Like, send us a voice note. Then you don't have to, like. Mess around with trying to schedule a call. We have our weekly call where we can do more of a deep dive. But if it is something that like genuinely warrants a call, then, you know, you can always do that. But what you don't want is a client thinking they can just like get you on the phone anytime they want because it's super disruptive to your workflow too. So just kindly saying like, hey, I'm not available today, but like send a voice note and I'll be able to respond to you in between meetings. You're going to get an answer quicker that way. Um, and then it's a lot of times they're just uncomfortable with leaving a voice note in a channel, you know, and once they get over that and we, again, I'm using the word train, but we train them that they get what they want by doing that. So when, when Gil does the voice notes and the videos, I'll get back to him pretty quickly so that he's rewarded for doing the behavior that I want. Um, we're, we're, we're dogs and cats right now. So this is like the top of mind for me, but our clients are not animals, but hopefully that's making sense, right? Like. They don't know what our expectations are or how to get the best out of us. This is super overwhelming, like everything. I don't know if you guys were overwhelmed by the new client orientation, but that's like their sixth call with us and there's still so much more information on how to do this process. So it's just helping them to do this as easy as possible, get the best out of us, and also us be able to support them better. If they're confused on a model, it's much easier for them to do a video, show the model, send the link, so you can kind of see what they're doing. And often, you know, once you guys get familiar with that, you'll be able to answer their question in five minutes as opposed to scheduling a 30-minute call with them to go through it, don't necessarily need to do that sometimes. And the deeper questions can be on Buyer's Club or on the weekly calls. And the Tuesday Buyer's Club is going to start getting more action because I'm not going to be on all the client meetings, so they come to get more. And that's where you guys can be like, hey, this feels like an advanced structuring thing. Let's get you and your model ready so we can discuss this with the group and Athena. Because they have the weekly time with me, the Tuesday meetings have been like, and we want to get deal flow up too. So there's a lot of stuff for us to talk about. Sorry, I'm digressing a little bit, but cool. Okay.

[00:42:27]
Anke Jordaan: And then this kind of just ends out in terms of the next step is if, oh, sorry, this shouldn't be decision. Hold on. This should be seller call. So if the next step is going, they're going to meet the seller, helping them prepare five to 10 owner questions with the document that they have, then the same thing happens. After they have the seller call, they have to post the debrief in Slack, same way they do it with the, with the, with the broker call. And then from there. I didn't add the rest of the steps on our side, but from there on, they have to prepare for the owner call, post the owner call feedback. From there on, they can now decide if they're ready to move forward with this deal. Then we pop into the pre-LOI document with that entire process of the steps that they need to take when they're ready to, you know, get an LOI together.

[00:43:27]
Athena Simpson: So something that'll be really good and help you guys having to explain yourselves over and over is understanding what resources they have available to them. So that rather than saying like, okay, you know, typing out what they need to do to get ready for an LOI, it's like, hey, it seems like you like this one. Here's the pre-LOI document. Make sure you read this so you know what comes next. Or, hey, you know, like, I know you really liked the broker call. You're getting ready for the owner call. Watch this training. on owner call relationships, review this document so that you know what to do. There's all these resources on the dashboard that we should be signposting them to, which saves you having to explain yourself over and over again and also gives them a lot of support and nuance in between having those conversations with us. For the owner call, for example, what we want to do is get them positioned to be liked and to also figure out whether they like that person. That's like the goal of call number one, if we have time. And what we don't want is them diving into on your, you know, in 2022, there was a dip in your gross profit margin. What was that about? The sellers don't know that stuff, right? So there's appropriate questions for the owner. There's appropriate questions for the broker. You know, if there's like on that first call is not where we start diving into the details. It's like this person does. Doesn't even know us, you know, if we have the time, if the client has the time, then just getting on the call and there's ways to ask the questions to get the answers that you want. If they're super concerned about workload, for example, and be like, gosh, you sound like it's so amazing how much you work. Like, do you ever get a vacation? You know, that's not saying like directly, like it seems like you work too much, you know, like you, you should have delegated things. Like, are you taking vacation? And see what they say. like, there's, there's just ways to ask the questions to get the answers that you want. So in a lot of the trainings that I have done, we explain that. And then as a team on the deal review and stuff like that, we can, we can also collab so you guys can learn that. So when you have a deal that it's like, okay, they just did this, they're going to the owner call, they're concerned about these things. Like. Here's how I'm thinking they can ask the questions or whatever. So we can kind of do some, yeah, collaboration there. Okay, so I didn't want to spend this much time on this, but it's important because we want to get the clients off to the right start. Also, for the first write-up for any new client, I'm going to review it before it goes to them. That includes you, Luke. So I know Anke asked you for Morgan's. I would like to see that. We can discuss it in deal review. So just make sure you guys are building in that time, too, for me to be able to have a look at things. For Cash and Charis, I'm going to want to see all your write-ups until we feel like you've graduated. And yeah, any questions on that stuff so far? You're going to get some additional training on the buyer profiles and NDAs, but the concept, does that feel okay?

[00:46:58]
Ryan Cash: Yeah. No, that sounds clear. What process do you want us to use when we feel like we have a write-up, it's ready to go? Do you want us to post in a specific channel? Like, hey, need this write-up reviewed? What are we doing to get that moving? Actually, I'm going to let Anke answer since she's ops.

[00:47:23]
Athena Simpson: I have an idea, but she'll probably have a better one.

[00:47:26]
Anke Jordaan: So think you guys have the analyst channel. So I think drop it in the analyst channel and just say, hey, my write-up is ready for name your client. And then like Athena said, you guys can go through it and she can review it and you guys can go through it in the deal review calls on Tuesdays and Thursdays.

[00:47:46]
Athena Simpson: Yeah, if it's time sensitive, like I'll try to review before then. So just do me a favor, tag Anke and me when you guys drop a write-up in the channel, because she can get a hold of me and let me know that it's ready.

[00:48:00]
Anke Jordaan: And also add the time sensitivity maybe to the deal as well. That would just help knowing the urgency on it.

[00:48:09]
Athena Simpson: Yeah, like are there a lot of offers? Is this one going to move quick? Like that sort of thing. So just help me with urgency. I think it's better if we have time to discuss it on deal review so we can all learn together, right, and get that feedback and collab on that stuff. But I'd like to review it before the deal review calls so that I can give some good feedback rather than just turning up with them at the deal review call. So tag me and Anke in the channel. She'll let me know. Let us know the time sensitivity when you do that. And then depending on where we're at in the week and also my schedule, I'll try to review it as soon as possible. Or if it makes sense, we'll just review it in the deal review calls.

[00:48:58]
Anke Jordaan: But make sure you guys go through the... The first write-up document the clients have, so you know exactly what they know the steps to be and watch the call that has ended with Peter Jackson, so that when you guys are ready with your write-up, you already have all of the knowledge and the steps in place of what's going to happen next.

[00:49:18]
Athena Simpson: Also on that call, that was before we wrote this training. So there's things in there that I didn't do. Like I didn't tell him he must do the broker call and the owner call. I didn't tell him like on that call that we need to schedule the next call. We kind of realized by going through the process with him, I guess it's watching that call to just kind of see, okay, this was more of an explainer session rather than like diving deep into the write-up. So he knows kind of, okay, here's how I fit. You know, I was like, can you sign an NDA? Let's see if you even have Adobe. Let me see where you're at with that. You know, which is why it might be good to bring Ida onto that first call too, so she can help do tech checks and help. them on that side. Yeah.

[00:50:05]
Anke Jordaan: Sweet.

[00:50:06]
Athena Simpson: I have a question about the Adobe.

[00:50:09]
Charis Siau: Yeah. If they currently are familiar with, you know, another eDocuSign platform, is that okay that they continue? Oh, absolutely.

[00:50:17]
Athena Simpson: Yeah. But so there's Adobe, you got to make sure that we give them the link, which we have it somewhere, Ida. don't know where it went, but like for Adobe Reader, which is a free service, not Adobe Acrobat. So, but it's hard to find that link. Cause like you have to kind of search and search and search to be able to find the free version of it. Cause they're always trying to push you to the paid one. If they have another eSign, that's fine. It's just Adobe Reader is the, usually the easiest and the free, and you can like save your signature in there and your initials and type all in the free version of it. Um, so I just don't want them paying for stuff if they don't need to.

[00:51:00]
Charis Siau: Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Cool. But yeah, they can sign it however they want.

[00:51:04]
Athena Simpson: I guess the point to get across there is like, you don't need to ink sign, you know, but they think, you know, most legal documents need to be ink signed. So that was like, not a bad assumption on their part. Just makes their lives a little, we realized when they were on vacation, they're like, we don't have access to a printer. I'm like, why are you printing things?

[00:51:30]
Anke Jordaan: so yeah, that specific link, uh, Athena is in the, as part of the first write-up, it's in the, to sign an NDA, exactly where they need to download it, how to sign the NDA step-by-step for them as well.

[00:51:43]
Athena Simpson: Let's get it in the internal so that these guys know what, what they should be doing and how to help them with that. So I guess, I guess the, the ramble there was when you watch the Peter call, just know that I kind of realized on the call that we needed to put this process in place, which is why I ran it that way. So there's some things that go off the document. That's the most recent and what we want to do. The call was kind of like how I handled it with him and just walked him through it and that sort of thing. So it'll just give you some kind of flavor there. Good. And then it'd be good for when you guys do those first write-up calls, if you feel like one went really well, that would be awesome for the training manual, like let's replace it. So it's actually best practice rather than Athena came up with a process on the spot. Cool.

[00:52:40]
Anke Jordaan: Okay.

[00:52:41]
Athena Simpson: I have a quick question actually on that.

[00:52:43]
Charis Siau: Do we have a company loom that we should be using? Yes.

[00:52:51]
Anke Jordaan: Okay.

[00:52:52]
Athena Simpson: Okay.

[00:52:52]
Charis Siau: But on the call you'll be using Fathom.

[00:52:55]
Athena Simpson: Yes.

[00:52:56]
Charis Siau: Yes. Okay. Oh yeah, that's right. That's right. So So Loom would just be for like the write-up preview videos, right?

[00:53:04]
Anke Jordaan: Okay. Okay.

[00:53:06]
Charis Siau: Cool.

[00:53:10]
Athena Simpson: Okay. Good questions. Anything else on that, Anke?

[00:53:15]
Anke Jordaan: No, I think we got through it all.

[00:53:20]
Athena Simpson: Okie dokie. So things I wanted to get through today. I'm going to talk through the onboarding sessions. Charis did an amazing job, but I realized I needed to give a lot more context to you guys on some certain sections. So I spent the better part of yesterday, like actually writing a whole script for that call. I'm going to go through that really quick and then dive into the finance section in particular and just talk through that with you guys. Because it's a really important section and it can feel... Thank you. Very uncomfortable to dig into someone's personal finances, but it's super important for us. So we're going to do that. Then just talk through some slight changes to the deal box discovery call. Then we're going to talk through broker calls and I'm going to give context. And then Luke's going to do some training with you. Like, honestly, Luke's probably our master objection handler here because he's had way more practice than I have at this point on it. I just want to talk through why we do these calls, what we want the outcome to be of these calls, you know, the important kind of AcquiMatch elements of the calls. So you can bear that in mind when you start getting training from Luke. Why don't we take a quick break, come back in like five minutes. So let's say two past the hour in case there's some timing. So cash was quick on the exit there. So I'll see you guys at two past that. hour. Okay. Sounds good.

[00:55:35]
Charis Siau: Thank you.

[01:01:12]
Anke Jordaan: You could have just turned off your video.

[01:01:16]
Charis Siau: Was I that early?

[01:01:18]
Anke Jordaan: No, I mean, you dropped out of the call. I added you back in. You could have just turned off your audio and video. Oh, really?

[01:01:27]
Charis Siau: For some reason, I feel like even when we're on client calls with the onboardings, I feel like everyone actually leaves the whole room.

[01:01:38]
Ryan Cash: No? So when you turn your video off, it makes it look like you left the carousel. Yeah, she's gone.

[01:01:48]
Anke Jordaan: Yeah, now it looks like you're gone.

[01:01:50]
Ryan Cash: And now you're back. Oh, my gosh, Charis is back. No.

[01:01:57]
Anke Jordaan: Yeah. No, just, you know, turn off your audio. If turn off your video, you disappear from the gallery. then, because like, I always keep an eye on the waiting room, right? But sometimes Athena doesn't, or sometimes whoever is the host doesn't keep an eye on the waiting room. You could be sitting there and not knowing it. But you would be like, that's a long time to make a coffee.

[01:02:17]
Charis Siau: But what, what, on what scenario, when I turn off my video, like yesterday on our call, Luke, with the broker calls, like if I turn my video off, it goes to my like image, you know, still looks like I'm in the room. Does it not? No. Oh, maybe that's just what I see. Okay. All right. We figured it out. Um, I was, I was going to say, Charis, that was some of my feedback from the onboarding call was to just turn off your video and your microphone rather than leaving, especially hosting the meeting, which is, yeah, I was actually going to ask about that before our call. was like, should we stay in the room or, uh, but yeah, we just talked about that. I didn't. Okay. So stay in the room, turn off video, turn off audio.

[01:03:03]
Athena Simpson: Got it. Yeah. You can change the view, um, the, like on the top in view. And then, um, like there's a setting for hide non-video participants. And I always like, if you guys know how to do that, then I always tell the clients to do it too. Um, because the note takers will be in there and like, it's, I think it's annoying to see all those note takers. Um, but when you're the last, when everybody's turned the camera off, then I see my picture too. And we're in the like little breaks. So that, that, got it.

[01:03:40]
Charis Siau: No worries. Will we get all our own, like zoom accounts then for, um, future onboarding calls?

[01:03:49]
Anke Jordaan: Uh, have them?

[01:03:53]
Ryan Cash: They have their own zoom accounts.

[01:03:56]
Anke Jordaan: They just not yet on a paid plan.

[01:04:00]
Charis Siau: So it would stop, I think, at 40 minutes, I think. I think it's like half an hour, actually.

[01:04:05]
Ryan Cash: Yeah, Anke, they all need longer accounts if they're going to be doing client meetings.

[01:04:09]
Anke Jordaan: Yeah, if they're going to be doing client meetings and onboarding stations, yeah.

[01:04:12]
Athena Simpson: Yeah. Let's get it on the company, though, like not doing individual setups so that we have a master view of that. Yeah, no, absolutely.

[01:04:24]
Anke Jordaan: They set up their Zoom accounts with their AcquiMatch emails. So everything is waiting to just be converted. Okay, cool.

[01:04:34]
Athena Simpson: Good stuff. Okay, so I want to go through just the, what are we calling it, buyer discovery call while it's fresh. Charis ran it on her own with a couple, which is difficult. She did an amazing job, really great energy, kept us on track. Throughout. Throughout. see you next time. And so I thought it was, you know, good time management. You built good rapport with them. They were really excited by the end of it. Running that is hard when you're still learning all of this too. So I don't take that lightly that we're kind of throwing you into these client calls. So I think you did a great job. So it was really helpful for me to watch too, because when I watch somebody doing something, I'm like, oh, we should make sure we clear that up. And so all this feedback is not anything that you did wrong. It was just like, oh, here's some areas that I want to like double click on and give some more context to. Also, we didn't have a exact script. So I thought it would take me 30 minutes yesterday. It's spent the better part of yesterday actually like writing a full script for that call. But it just makes it really easy on you guys then to run those calls because you just need to read the script rather than remembering all the points. So I'm going to talk through some of that now. Anke is going to get it updated into. Our format and everything, so please forgive the formatting. It's not AcquiMatch branding. Where is it? Deal box discovery. Okay, that's not the one I wanted. Hang on. Okay, so there's going to be like a training and then just a script on its own.
SCREEN SHARING: Athena started screen sharing - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/378743843?timestamp=3988.218003
So the training gives nuance and context to every single section. The script is just something you can pull up when you're going through the call. But I would spend some time, so all of you now are going to have a break before your next buyer discovery call. So just make sure before that call that you spend a good You know, amount of time going through this and just prepping yourself for those calls. The things that I think are important to pull out is the structure of this. So in the training, it's like, what is this part for? Why do we do it? What's the exact language, the script that we use? So for the opening section, for example, now we have a full script. It includes you doing introductions, includes like, you know, the where are we and what they're going to do and what happens next. Talking through the structure, et cetera, et cetera. Here's the agenda for today. Okay. Okay. Um, then the, um, next thing is, you know, going through the, uh, what happens next. So you're going to have that, that map, but here's the script for how you go through that map. So something that's really important, um, is establishing kind of a, authority might not be the right word, but you're the guide, right? So you're the one that kind of owns this call. This is their first real long call with us. They've only had a tech call and, you know, a welcome call up to this point. Um, so it's important for you all to come on confident and be like, here's what we're doing today. Right. And permission to facilitate. So I'm going to be jumping in and getting us on track if we're off track, those sorts of things. Um, then here's the process. Here's what we're going through. So if at any time they are like, you know, what do you mean by that? You want to clarify and kind of tell them what you want from that answer. And I think spending more time understanding the why behind the questions is going to help you know how to answer that. So something, for example, that caught Charis off guard was this perfect day versus setting the destination. You guys will want to do this exercise yourself so you understand the components of it. Setting the destination is the overall exercise. But there's a whole ton of questions in there and things that they need to do. So the first thing that we want to do is ask them how the exercise felt. Right. Because it's like usually it's like a weird thing to sit down and do something like this. Depends on whether our clients are like, you know, into biohacking and mindfulness and that sort of things. Like some of them have never done this kind of visualization. exercise before some, like Lisa, just came on and started launching into her values and vision and this and that. And so we got off track a little bit. We got her kind of back on track. So the first question is, how did the exercise feel, right? Was there anything that came through that you weren't expecting? How was the exercise itself, the entire thing? Like, how did that feel for you? And then the next question is, what does your perfect day look like? So that's an aspect of what's in that overall exercise that they were doing. And then it's, okay, how does business ownership fit into that? So what we're doing in this first section is we're goal setting. We're getting what their vision is. We're understanding like what good feels like for them. So, you know, why are you wanting to inquire a business? How does acquisition impact your life? 10 years, what's happening? So I'm going to remove this question, actually. So because they're going to say buying a business. So I've given some more context and words to a lot of these questions, too, as we go through this so that you're able to kind of like understand the context behind it and give some more definitions. So something that I often do in the calls that wasn't necessarily in the training is that I'd clarify the question with them or I'd dive into a little bit deeper. So important for you to read through this. And then there's just notes on, you know, each one of these sections on, you know, giving it context, why it matters, why we ask those things, you know, different things to dive into. So spend some time going through these. I would do it closer to your next, like, you know, read through it now, but also revisit all this before your next call. This is all laid out. out in a way that's kind of like a funnel. So we don't want to get into business characteristics. We don't want to, you know, get into, um, uh, like up here, they like Lisa started going into her, what her skill sets were and all of those sorts of things. So I was like, okay, we need to tell them what's coming. Um, that's actually in here. Uh, let me see, where did I put it? Okay. Here, here's how we'll spend the time today. We're going to start with your vision and goals. Then your lifestyle and work preferences. From there, we'll talk long-term objections, financial goals, how you're thinking of funding. the acquisition. We'll cover management, experience, investment, comfort, and personal interest. Then we'll wrap up with culture. That way we'll have like everything as a place. Um, next time. Let's This is how we'll spend our time today so you know exactly where we're heading. And so you don't feel like you have to get everything out all at once. I'll guide the conversation and make sure we cover everything. If something pops up that we're going to talk about later, I'll park it and circle back at the right time. So this tells them what's coming and then also gives you permission to park it. So if you're asking them what their perfect day looks like and they start launching into their management experience, you can be like, hey, we're going to dive into your management experience a little bit later. Let's refocus. Like, tell me what your perfect day looks like. Right. So because they went through that exercise. And if you guys aren't familiar with the components of the exercise, then it'll be hard for you to kind of know why they're doing that. But it does ask them what's their skills? Where does business ownership fit? So if we're not clear on what components of that we want to ask them about, then they're going to try to tell us everything because they're not sure. So this is something that I added. It was actually telling them what the agenda is. Like, here's what we're going to cover today so that they know, oh, okay. We're going to cover all this stuff. Then the last thing I want to talk about here is financial. So this section is really important because we need to understand what their buying power is. We need to understand what they need to be able to survive and cover their bills, what their ideal number is, what we would need to replace their income. So all of these things help us get a picture to know how to structure deals and what tools we have in the finance toolkit. So we need to make sure to ask all of these questions, right? Not just ask them like what they want to make and then move on from there. This can feel uncomfortable. So if they, if they get a little like, it's, it's. Tell them like the more we know about your situation, the better we can help you like pick the right business and do something that makes you feel comfortable. We're never going to push you to spend more than you're comfortable with. Right. But we, we need to understand what you, your situation looks like. So also a frame that's really important. They'll usually tell you what they think the SDE number is that includes debt service. includes reinvestment. That's not what we need them to do. We're not, we don't want them to do the math. Um, so reading this and saying, we're not asking you to do the financing math. So please leave out debt service and reinvestment numbers in your answers. I want to understand your personal income target, what you need to replace and what you want to earn. So what's your financial goal. Right. And that's left general for a reason. Um, like do they have a number in mind of what they're wanting to make is really what you're teasing out there. Then the follow-up question is how much do you need to fully replace your current W2 income? Or if they're not working, what was your last salary? Does that include bonus or incentives? And oftentimes they'll give you numbers that are pre-tax, right? So is that pre-tax or post-tax? Okay, cool. That's pre-tax. What's the minimum number of cash to hit your bank account that would make this worth it for you? So worth taking the risk? What's the minimum amount that they want hitting the bank account? So Luke's come up against this, right? He'll find deals that he's like, oh, this is great. It's kind of semi-absentee. It's a little bit lower than what they want. And they're like, it's not worth it to me for that little money. So we need to know what the little amount of money is. Like what's the least amount of money that they would take on a risk like this? And then what number would make you feel this is worth it? Feels like the same question, but it's not. It's two different questions, right? What's the minimum that you would take the risk for? And what number would make you feel like this whole exercise is worth it? And that's the number to their bank account. So if they're in W-2s, they pretty much don't have any way to like tax incentivize themselves. So business ownership is a way that you give yourself a lot of tax incentives, like tax advantages. And in our modeling spreadsheet, those free cash flow numbers are post-tax. So it's important for us to know what that post-tax number is that hits their bank account, right? So that we can make sure that those numbers are matching. And then the SDE number above that is going to include taxation. So does this all make sense? Why we're asking this many questions about the financial goal?

[01:17:48]
Ryan Cash: Yeah, for me, that's super clear.

[01:17:51]
Athena Simpson: Sweet. Okay. Um, then if there's a dual income situation, like Either their partner's doing it together, or it's somebody that has a partner, but they're doing this on their own. Do you want to be able to replace both you and your spouse's income or your partner's income, just yours, or give your partner the option not to work, right? So we want to dig into what's the ideal scenario here? Is it just you? A lot of them are like, no, my partner's going to keep working. We want to have that additional income so I can be the one to take the risk. Some, like I said before, like, you know, they're like, no, I'd really love to give my partner the option not to work, or I'd really like to get them in the business for me. Okay, well, what do we need to make that happen? What is your partner's salary? What is their current market salary or their current comp? So you understand what they're currently making, and then also what would be enough to get them out of work. Sometimes those numbers are different, right? And they're like, well, we could live off this much, but they're currently making this much. So there's different answers. So there's... this question, which is why we need to ask it in a couple of different ways. Okay. The next part is the finances. So next we're going to ask you, we're going to look at finances. I'm going to ask you from two lenses. One is what you have available to invest, which gives us an idea of your buying power. And then the other number is what you're willing to invest. The buying power just helps us go out and look at bigger deals and won't pressure to use all of your net worth. It's just knowing what we have to work with and how we can position you as a buyer. So we need to get both of those numbers from them also. Like what they have available is not necessarily what they're willing to invest. And if they just give you what they're willing to invest, then they're not telling you what they have available, which doesn't give us a full picture of what their buying power might be. When we look at larger deals for people, we need to know that if we're, if the broker's like, well, do they have enough cash to be able to do the down payment? We need to know that answer to that, right? You need to have a kind of idea of what we're looking at with the SBA need to have an idea of what their assets are. So that if we need to, we can talk them through some of these advanced strategies, like how to use their retirement account without a taxable event or how to use home equity to be able to make their financial picture look better, right? So what's available to invest? What's your buying power? What's the cash and near liquid funds you deploy if needed, including any pending bonuses or vesting that might be coming up? And then what are you willing to invest of that? So, okay, they might have like a million across cash and stocks and near liquid stuff. Like what of that are you willing to invest? If they haven't told you whether it's all liquid, so like what is that number made up of? Is that all liquid? So it's understanding what they're pulling from of their financial situation that they're seeing as their investment money. Great. Now I'm going to get a sense of your financial situation. you. it. So we can understand how a lender would view your buying power and what post-close liquidity you would have if the business couldn't pay you for a period. That's what that post-close liquidity means is like how much available liquidity do they have if their business was not able to afford paying them? Could they pull from some additional funds? So lenders want to know that they're not completely tapping out all their accounts when they buy the business. They want to know that they have some cushion. So then you're going to ask about all of this stuff. Like any 401k or retirement accounts, if they say yes, are you familiar with the ROBS strategy, which is a way to use business finances to fund your, or it's a way to use your 401k funds to fund business, to fund an acquisition. I need to clear this up and make it a little bit. It's essentially a way for them to use their 401k. that a wives. The. To buy a business without getting a taxed penalty. So it's an official strategy that can be used to use 401k funds to invest in your business. A lot of people don't even know that they can do that. It's not an early withdrawal. It's not taxed that way. It is a little bit complicated. Are they like loaning it to themselves? They're investing it. Really?

[01:22:24]
Ryan Cash: So it just goes straight into an investment? It's interesting. Yeah.

[01:22:29]
Athena Simpson: So they have to set up their business as a C-corp and then their 401k becomes an investor in their business. And as an investor, anytime there's distributions, they get distributions for whatever percentage equity that they have. So say the 401k is a 21% shareholder of the business. Anytime they take money distributions, 21% of that has to go back into the 401k.

[01:22:52]
Ryan Cash: Was that based on the 401k? private equity changes, the 401k rules that allowed for private business?

[01:23:00]
Athena Simpson: No, this has been, I mean, Susie, our woman from ROBS, it might be worth cash, or all of you actually, I think Luke was already on that call. Susie from Guidant did a really great presentation on the ROBS strategy. It's on the Buyer's Club replays. She's been doing it for 20 years. So your 401k or a 401k or your IRA is to make investments. So you're investing into a business, right? Like, but you're, it's almost like a self-directed investment into a business, into your own business. So the expectation is that it's allowed because it's like, you know, supposedly growing the investment because it's a shareholder and you can buy the shareholder out. Like when you get enough money, you can make your 401k whole and no longer need to keep giving it distributions, but it's yet another way to grow your retirement. If your business is doing well. But it's, it's cool. Cause a lot of people have a bunch of like old 401ks from jobs and whatever. And it's like, you can either use it for your down payment, or it's a, I say it's a no  fund. Um, because even after you've acquired the business, if you need cash and you're not getting anything from the banks, you could use your ROBS, or you could do a ROBS strategy to use your 401k to get a financial investment. Or to buy a business, right? If they want to buy another one, they can use their 401k to do that. Um, cool. Any home equity? Are you familiar with HELOCs? Do you have a HELOC? This is a home equity line of credit. Um, if they have you have a HELOC. A HELOC is essentially like a loan on your, on the equity in your home. So let's say somebody bought a house and the value increased by 200,000. So they take out a HELOC for 200,000. You want to know how much the HELOC is for overall and how much is available. So if they've used the 200K, then the bank wants to know that there's an independent source of money to pay off because it's essentially another loan that they have on top of their house. But if they've got a $200,000 HELOC that they haven't drawn from, then they could potentially draw from it down the line to either make an investment into the business and/or remove the equity in their home so the bank doesn't put a lien on it. So that's why it's important for us to know what their situation is with their, um, primary residence in HELOCs. Um, I've a few more questions in here because it's actually important to ask and find out. Any assets becoming liquid on a timeline, we should know about large purchases and progress. It should change your financial situation. A lot of our folks are real estate investors and they're buying homes or selling homes. So we need to know what that is, what that looks like. Credit score really needs to be above 700 for them to get approved for a loan. So you don't need to ask them what their credit score is. Just ask if it's above 700. Any former bankruptcies or back taxes owed. Both of these things will disqualify them typically from being able to get an SBA loan. Back taxes is easy. They can pay that, right? As long as they're up to date, you can't take money from the government if you haven't paid the government, basically. Former bankruptcies is a little... A bit more complicated. FYI, Charis, Lisa does have a form of bankruptcy, but went through the whole process with Live Oak and actually got approved. So it was long enough ago that she's overcome that, but it might come up with other lenders. So that's just something for us to be aware of. But usually if Live Oak does something, the rest of the banks will follow suit because they're so conservative.

[01:27:23]
Charis Siau: Um, I think it's usually what, like seven or 10 years, uh, depending on, depending on which type of, uh, bankruptcy.

[01:27:32]
Athena Simpson: Yeah, but it's still, still a pain in the . So she already went through all the trouble with Wendy from Live Oak. Wendy loves her, loves her. And Wendy will turn, she turns away, like I'd say 80, 90% of the deals. She loves our clients, but she still turns away 80, 90% of the deals we send her. Um, so it was just something that happened with the business that they were trying to buy, but otherwise they were, they were approved by Live Oak for, for that.

[01:27:58]
Charis Siau: Um, but this.

[01:28:00]
Athena Simpson: This is important, right? Because it's, we want to get ahead of it. Most of them were like, no, but if they do, then we want to get ahead of it. And it will come up during the SBA pre-qualification too. But it's better for us to just, I mean, this, both of these things on a deal that I consulted on, was like the most  crazy deal that I hope we can talk about someday. But both of these things came up and I still managed to get them approved when they had no money. Any existing SBA bank relationships we should know? And do you already have pre-approval, pre-qualification letters from whom and how much? This is for us to understand if they have any people that they have relationships with that they will want to use. It's not that they can't, just with what we do and us being applied towards equity injection, it's a little bit easier if it's lenders that know who we are and we've already had that conversation with them. So it's good for us to know if they have any, like, preferences there or pre-approvals that we should know about, or even if they've already gotten pre-approval. So Anke, I'm really hoping that Eda knows that Lisa and Carmen already have a pre-approval from Live Oak, so she's not telling them to do the process. She does? Yeah, she does already work in the next steps. Great. So this is important, you guys, if they already have a pre-qualification from Live Oak, that you communicate that to Eda so she doesn't launch off with getting them through. But it has to be from Live Oak specifically. If they have other pre-qualification letters from other people, be like, that's great. Live Oak actually gives us a pretty high amount. Typically, they're very generous with their pre-qualifications. Or they might say, I have a letter of support from Live Oak. If it doesn't have a number on it, we still need them to go through our process. So most of the time, they don't want to. Spend the time with every single person that contacts them doing a pre-qualification because they go through their resume, they do an interview call for them, they go through their personal financial statement. So most of the time Live Oak will just send a letter of support, which doesn't have a number attached to it. But our clients, they love our clients, so they go through the pre-approval process with our clients. And, okay, any questions on that?

[01:30:31]
Charis Siau: When addressing the bankruptcies or the owed taxes, should we just kind of address that? Like, are you able to pay your back taxes? And then on the bankruptcy, is there any sort of way we should address that if they did have a bankruptcy? Like, kind of what we should say? Okay, so how long? Okay.

[01:31:13]
Athena Simpson: Okay, good questions. If back taxes, just can you tell me a little bit more about the situation? Have you agreed a repayment plan? If they're under a payment plan, then usually it's okay. It's not ideal, right? But this is something where you can say, like, you don't have to dig into it too deep. You could be like, okay, cool. Athena is kind of a specialist here for how we navigate this. If the bankruptcy was like last year, then like, holy , we might, you know, this should be flagged with me, right? So we can figure it out. And if we genuinely can't help someone, like, I wouldn't feel good taking their money. Like, hopefully this, you know, Austin's kind of usually. Hopefully this stuff will come up in the sales calls. But if they genuinely can't get financing and they, they aren't able to buy a business, then flag this with me immediately after you get off the call and we'll discuss it. So you don't need to go too deep into it. Just be like, oh, okay. You had a bankruptcy. Like how long ago was it? Right. And then if it was like two years ago, be like, okay, cool. I think we'll probably want to chat with Athena about this.

[01:32:25]
Charis Siau: Okay. We can come up with a plan for you.

[01:32:27]
Athena Simpson: So you don't need to say like, we are not going to be able to, don't, don't feel like you need to say that on the call. Just be like, okay, cool. I'm going to chat with Athena after this call and we'll, you know, come up with a financing plan and then raise it with me. And we can talk through how, how we handle that. The back taxes thing again, like Wendy's, Wendy's super friendly. So if they're already in a repayment plan, she'll be able to have a look and let us, she always lets me know whether there's only one client I've ever sent her that she's like, I'm not sure about this one. The rest of them, she's like, I love your clients. You know, like, she's like, Peter. Here's the. So, and she loves Lisa. Like she was so, so, so upset that Lisa and that deal didn't go through. So I'll be able to get a read from her too, when they go through the prequel process and what her, her feeling is on likelihood for them to get financed. If it's pretty low, then, you know, we'll just need to make an executive call on it.
ACTION ITEM: Update buyer discovery call script w/ recent changes
- WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/378743843?timestamp=5601.9999

[01:33:24]
Charis Siau: Cool. Awesome.

[01:33:26]
Athena Simpson: Okay. So there's a full script here. Anke, could you just, the things that I just updated here, make sure it's reflected on the, the script side. So then that way you guys can just read this aloud as you go through. Um, and I just usually like, I'll put this to one side and I'll have the videos on the other and I'll just go through it. Um, keep an eye on time when it's looking around about the hour. I'll, I'll try to get to the end of a section. One other thing, Charis, is when you get better. When you have more experience with this, you'll be able to get them back on track. Lisa got really excited about her values and all that stuff. I love them. You can see why Wendy loves them too. They're a lot of fun. But we want to try to get through the hobbies and interests and the other parts. I think we had to park that for part two. So yeah, just try to like, if I've gotten through the financing section by the first hour, then I feel like I'm usually in a good place. So just for you guys to kind of keep an eye on timing, like if we haven't gotten through financing and it's been an hour, you got to speed up the pace. Charis saw this and with couples, this can often be the thing. And then we had our first ever like brother-sister pair. They each had like different views, different everything. And I was like, oh , it feels like we're doing two different searches, but we got them, got them back on track on call too. So sometimes things are just going to come up. That's weird. You can always schedule another call, right? Like if you don't get it through everything, you can always schedule another call and be like, hey, we're at time. Do you have an hour tomorrow to just go through the rest of this? Because it's just going to be you guys and not dependent on my ridiculous schedule. Like, you know, I'd rather you spend the time going through all this stuff because I cannot tell you how much it helps you to get all this unearthed early on. It helps the whole team now that we're building these like profiles and stuff and like the psychological profiles also that David and his team are building out for us. It just helps a lot. And yeah, so like if you need to schedule a follow-up call, like please feel free to do that if you're not getting through everything and it's just a really juicy conversation. Sound good? Yeah, sounds great.

[01:36:04]
Charis Siau: I mean, this is really helpful to have a script. Yeah, I can see how there was a lot that fell through the cracks, you know, without the script and kind of line by line.

[01:36:16]
Athena Simpson: You did a really great job, like I said, because you haven't been on the analyst side, right? And seeing, like, I think it's like when you've done this so many times and you see the things that come up or the questions that come up about them or the things that they, like the answers that we need, then it's easier to kind of be like, oh no, I need to dig in on this question. And see, the more you guys are doing, and you're going to start getting write-ups like out this week. So when you start seeing that stuff comes up, then it's more instinctual, oh, no, wait, they didn't answer that the way I know I'm going to need it in the future. So I think given the lack of context on why we're asking the questions, you did awesome. I would have. By the second half, was just doing other stuff. I was very confident in your ability to lead that session. So I was trying to knock my head so it seemed like I was present. But like, if I'm tuning out, it just means you're doing a good job if I'm tuning out and I don't feel like I need to be at like attention. So I was very happy with how it was going. You did great.

[01:37:24]
Charis Siau: I'm glad to hear that.

[01:37:27]
Athena Simpson: What were you going to say, Anke? Oh, I just saying well done to Charis.

[01:37:32]
Charis Siau: Oh, thank you both. Really well done.

[01:37:34]
Athena Simpson: That is a very intense thing to have to run a call like that with limited experience in front of me.

[01:37:44]
Charis Siau: So I don't take that away at all.
ACTION ITEM: Lead deal box discovery call w/ Josh
- WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/378743843?timestamp=5869.9999

[01:37:47]
Athena Simpson: I think you guys are doing so great with all this stuff. Real quick. So on the deal box discovery call, Luke, feel free to say no. But since there is a script for this one, and you've watched a million of these, how would you feel of running this one with Josh today instead of me?

[01:38:11]
Luke Gillespie: Yeah, I can do it. Cool.

[01:38:13]
Athena Simpson: I'll be on the call so I can dive in. But just, you know, make sure you're following the script. Like, just read it out and we should be all good. Good. Something that is just really important on that questionnaire is understanding why they've chosen the choices that they have. Right? So it's not just like, oh, I like so and so or I don't like so and so it's like, and I've added a little bit more in here. So Luke, just go in and just read this questionnaire walkthrough script. So, you know. You marked so-and-so choice. Tell me about what led you to that answer, or tell me about why you did that. So we want to listen for strong preferences, past experience, something they've read or heard, or an assumption they've made. So if they're making it restrictive, it's like, okay, here's what I'm asking, right? Like, but it's more you want to understand their thought process behind those industry choices. That's what's most important with running through the questionnaire. And I know you've watched a million of these too, so you know how often they end up changing their mind in these calls. So we want to make sure that we're getting to a good place. But I'll be on the call with you, so I can jump in if I need to dig in, if I can have that permission from you. But I think you're going to be great there. And then the other thing that we've changed on this one is getting their acquisition experience so far in this call. We just weren't having enough time in the first call and it didn't really make sense there. think it's better to do it after we get all the industry preferences and everything. So you're going to have to kind of speed up the industry preference section and then get into, okay, cool. Tell us a bit about your experience so far. How many NDAs have you signed? How many SIMs have you reviewed or financials? Um, the point here, um, and then this is a script, right? So now that we mapped out your deal box, next stop is to talk about your experience. So if you follow the script, it should give them the context that they need. And then you can just follow and ask the questions. Then we want to, if we have time with whatever time that we have left, if they've gone deep into a business, like they signed an LOI, what did you like? What did you dislike? What, what made you decide to proceed or not proceed? What happened with it? Are there any specific experiences or beliefs that you think will influence future decisions? Um, and then the last questions that I've added here are, and I think it's important to make sure that we sign off with these. So keep an eye on time. And if you need to just kind of skip to this, and then you can do a deep dive with them on, on this in the future. But what would have to be true for a business for you to feel good about saying yes? And then what are your deal breakers or red flags? Like, what is a just absolute non-negotiable for you? And if they list off a whole bunch of things, then we want to do some coaching. Like, hey, we want to kind of pick two or three here. Um, you know, there's deal adjustments and there's deal breakers. You've heard me explain that enough, Luke, right?

[01:41:47]
Luke Gillespie: Yeah.

[01:41:47]
Athena Simpson: difference between deal adjustments and deal breakers. Do you want to have a go so that the team can learn from you?

[01:41:54]
Luke Gillespie: Yeah. So a deal breaker is something that's absolutely non-negotiable. You wouldn't be able for example, for you, Josh, that might be a strict licensing concern, like an HVAC license, or the business is located in Las Vegas, right? A geographic deal breaker for you. Those are going to be big deal breakers for you. A deal adjustment is just, oh, there's also a part-time CFO in the company that's working 20 hours per week, and they're going to be exiting. Okay, deal adjustment. Now you just have to add in an extra salary that you're going to have to pay to replace that part-time bookkeeper. That's a deal adjustment. And things like that. So we don't want you to have too many deal breakers. There can be a lot of deal adjustments. Obviously, we want to minimize that as much as possible, but we really want to get out the hard red flags, the big deal breakers here.

[01:42:42]
Athena Simpson: Good. Also, for the rest of it, that was really good. Also, for the rest of the team, clients will also often perceive deal adjustments as deal breakers. So they'll be like, oh, this person's leaving. I don't know how I can replace them. it's like, okay, well, let's... Let's stop and think about this. This feels like a deal adjustment rather than a deal breaker, right? We're not discovering fraud. The numbers aren't materially different than what they were. There's very few things that should cause them to exit a deal. Usually it ends up being something that an adjustment can be made to overcome the risk, right? Either a structuring thing or a negotiation conversation with the owner. But the closer clients get, or the further along they get in the process, they will perceive everything as a deal breaker. So oftentimes it's just a deal adjustment and we're there to kind of be like, okay, well, let's think through some solutions here, right? And help them kind of think of what is an adjustment that could be made that could make me comfortable with this. Okay, cool. And then you've got the script for closing out. So any questions on this? Feeling good?

[01:44:00]
Luke Gillespie: Yep, sounds good. Except I'm not going to ask about the NDA and the past LOIs and stuff for Josh because we already did that on the first call, but I'll ask him about the past deals, just not the past NDAs and SIMs he's reviewed.

[01:44:13]
Athena Simpson: Yes, great. Okay, good spot there. I wouldn't have even remembered that. Yet another reason why I want you guys to have your clients that you own and know intimately because it's hard for me to keep track of all 15 of them. Okay, cool. So last thing is broker calls. And I was struggling to find the old training for it, Anke.

[01:44:50]
Anke Jordaan: You want me to grab it for you? Yeah.

[01:44:54]
Athena Simpson: Yeah. Okay, give me a second.

[01:45:09]
Anke Jordaan: I'm dropping it for you in the Zoom chat, Athena, but you're on it.

[01:45:23]
Athena Simpson: Hmm, this isn't the one that I did initially, I don't think. Okay, let me talk through. One of the things that, the reason why I decided to include us doing the first broker call was because often a lot of the magic about a deal is lost in the SIM. Brokers are not great marketers. Oftentimes they don't even know. I understand business. As you guys are finding out, there's so many variables to doing a deal. You have various levels of competency from the broker side and how much they understand about these things or about businesses. In, I think, 11 or 12 states, you need a real estate license to be able to sell a business. And it just blows my  mind. So in the future, I plan on getting into the lobbying space as Uber did, because what on earth qualifies a real estate agent over somebody that taught at a top business school on entrepreneurship and has consulted for 10 years within businesses to sell businesses, right? That, to me, is a little bit crazy. So there's no standardization for being a business broker, but you are required to be a real estate broker in 10, 11 states. That is something for you guys to. Be wary of, also, if you're operating in one of those states that has that requirement. So Luke will be able to talk you through how to handle those conversations. It's really important to make it clear that we are not brokers. We do not get involved in, we are not in the middle of the transaction. So once we make it, we are matchmakers. When we make an introduction, the client is on the front lines having the conversations with the brokers and the owners. And we are behind them consulting them. We act as an advisor. So, but we've had, you know, Luke and, you know, the team have been on calls where the broker is like threatening to report us and that sort of thing. Because honestly, it's like the same thing that I think happened with the taxi industry when Uber came in. Like these people worked so hard to get these licenses. And now they have a bunch of new entrants coming and they feel under attack. So it's really about placating them. And. And letting them know we're on their side. Like, hey, I know how hard it is for you with all these like random new people. Our clients are qualified. They're going to make great owners. They have skin in the game. There's absolutely no fee to you or your client. We're paid independently. So all I'm here to do is, you know, save everybody time, see if it's a good fit. And we do not negotiate the deal. We're not going to be involved in the transaction. We're not brokers, right? We're matchmakers. Luke can help you with like some actual, you know, conversations there. But when I had my property management deal, I didn't find out the true, true gold of that deal until I got on the owner call. So the broker started saying things that I was like, oh my God, what, what? Like, are you serious? Like, this is amazing. And then I got on the owner. And I was like, holy . I was like, I will drive out to Dallas tomorrow. Like, just tell me when. And he's like, that would be great. The broker's like, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. And so out of like, I don't know, 14 buyers, I was able to meet them in person. But it's when the magic of that deal really started crystallizing for me. Like, how the owner just happened on something market timing wise that they didn't even realize was an absolute boon. And they're like, we're trying to slow down right now, not speed up. We're not the people to take this to the next level. Brokers won't often communicate that nuance. But we like as matchmakers, brokers will have a lot more color that they can give us than the SIM might, you know, that's a pain in the  document to make. So a lot of times they're just kind of like, okay, check the boxes, whatever. They'll even do things to try to like gatekeep and like put people off. Like Luke could probably tell you a whole bunch of stories of them. Them putting like outrageous listing prices to try to like, you know, weed out not serious buyers and all of this stuff. So it's why I want us to get on a broker call for every single deal is you might discover some of the magic or when you go through and ask those questions, you might realize, actually, I don't think this feels like a good fit. And it's an opportunity for us to verify our assumptions about the deals, just like we tell the clients. And then that way, the clients can learn through us for the questions that we ask, how we build those relationships. So they're able to listen in on the call. And, you know, for the existing clients, it's one of their favorite things is listening to Luke on those calls, you know. They're like, you asked all the questions. Like, I wouldn't even have thought of those questions. When I was doing the broker calls, my clients were excited about that, too, because they're like, I feel like that in itself is an education. And hearing how you guys handle those calls. So bear that. Mind is like, you're basically demonstrating best practice to our clients for how to have those conversations, build rapport, ask the right questions at the right time. So when you're on that call, it's, you know, if they've never heard of us before, you're having to break down the barriers of why they would want to work with us, right? My aim for that call, my outcome that I want is by the end of that call, they're excited about us and our clients. Right. So they just had a, and I've had people, brokers reach out to me independently and they're like, I just got off with Luke and he was amazing. Right. I want more of that. I want them getting so excited. They're coming to us and being like, I have a new deal coming to market. I want you guys to look at it first before anyone else. Right. That shows me that we're doing something that they see value in. And when they start realizing what we're doing, they get really excited because we're making their lives easier by bringing people that are not only,  were financially qualified, but we're also making sure that they're going to be the right bit for that business. So most brokers with any sense about them realize that we're in their corner, right? We're helping them out. So success on that call, the outcome is they are excited about our clients. They're excited to work with us. They're excited about building a relationship with us. And something like a nugget always dropped to them is like, yeah, you know, sometimes we might get excess off market deals and we don't, we're not brokers. So we could potentially pass them your way. I don't know if Luke's doing this anymore, but that got me so much goodwill from these guys. You know, cause them finding deal flow is really hard. So when you're on that call, you're able to ask questions that you're not able to ask to the seller. And what I want with that scorecard is for us to be standardizing the types of things that we need to get. It answered before we put a deal in front of a client. So we need to at least ask the question. And if we haven't, then we put that as an area of clarification because all of those things on the scorecard are pretty essential and could be deal breakers, right? So we need to know about customer concentration. We need to know if there's a single channel issue. We need to know if there's key man risk. We need to know if there's SOPs in place. So ideally, that's either answered in the SIM or it's a question that gets answered on the call. So it's a lot on the call, right? You're trying to build a report, educate them on who we are, get them excited about our client, and ask the questions that will help us decide whether it's a good deal for the client and or flag things that they will need to dig into. Oftentimes, brokers will be like, I don't know, you're going to have to ask the owner. Again, areas of clarification, that's why that section is on the write-up. It's anything that we weren't able to get answered that we know need to be answered pretty early on. can Bye. Bye. In that section. So the scorecard should give you a good list of, you know, if you guys are doing the scorecard alongside the write-up, have I been able to answer all these questions or at least ask the questions and know that that answer is sitting with the owner and I can flag that for the client. How's that for context so far? Luke's going to go through the how-to's. You guys will have endless amounts of broker calls that you can listen in on, learn from that. He'll teach you how to prepare for it, all of those other things, but at least from a contextual why we do it. Is that helpful? Any questions?

[01:54:43]
Ryan Cash: When you say scorecard, are we talking about that new financial valuation tool? Is that what we're talking about? Yeah.

[01:54:54]
Athena Simpson: Okay.

[01:54:54]
Ryan Cash: And so we've moved to the point where as of now, that's also being included. In the write-ups now?

[01:55:02]
Athena Simpson: Nope. That's something we're doing internally. So every write-up that you do, you should be using this scorecard. We're tweaking it and testing it. But regardless of what the score comes out at, all of those things are important to know for every deal. So it gives us standard areas that we need to be making sure that we're getting answered or clarity on. Or if the broker can't give us clarity on it, that we're pulling that point off and putting it in the areas of clarification.

[01:55:35]
Ryan Cash: Okay. So it's just useful for us, but we're not attaching it to the deal folder or anything? Not yet.

[01:55:43]
Athena Simpson: No. So when you send your write-up in the analyst channel, you'll also send the scorecard filled out. Because we're doing two things simultaneously. One is, as a group of analysts, you're standardizing the information that you're getting. Obviously, there's other stuff that's going to. Come up in the SIMs that you need that's, you know, business specific, but the major points of things that could be deal breakers or things that were like, you know, like with the benchmark things, it's like we got it and it's like 90% customer concentration is like, well, that's a no, you know, but we need to be asking the questions and not letting it to be like, if we put that deal in front of the client and hadn't picked up on that, that would not be like, like they're hiring us to make sure that we're looking for those things before we put it in front of them.

[01:56:36]
Ryan Cash: Got you. And do we want to store those anywhere in particular? I could see those starting to build up pretty quickly.

[01:56:46]
Anke Jordaan: Yeah, those files, Cash, you'll see that Luke put in the analyst channel where he dropped the new thread that they're going to have, you guys can have a conversation on that. see. With the link to a folder that I made, that you guys can store all of the scorecards. So those scorecards aren't accidentally saved in the client's deal files, but they're in that folder, just all of the scorecards. Let me just see where Luke put it.

[01:57:17]
Ryan Cash: Wait, yeah, which channel is that? Like, I'm not sure I have any idea.

[01:57:24]
Anke Jordaan: I'll just tag it for you. Okay.

[01:57:28]
Ryan Cash: I'll also pin it to the top of the analyst channel, so it's easy for everybody to be able to reach it.

[01:57:34]
Athena Simpson: Good idea. Also, guys, when you make those scorecards, please, please, please name it the same you would for the deal. So the deal number and the name of the deal itself, so that when we're scanning those in the folder, when I'm reviewing it, it makes sense.

[01:57:53]
Charis Siau: Just the deal code or also, like, the business listing title? Everything? Everything?

[01:58:00]
Athena Simpson: Yeah, whatever you're titling it in the write-up, use the same title so that, like, if I'm going in blind and I'm looking at a scorecard, I know what write-up that it's in relation to. And then in the scorecard, there's a spot for you to put the write-up link in there, too. But it's just, like, if you make a copy, it just is copy of template. So just make sure the title of the document has the deal number and the write-up name in there. So that if we're scanning it in that deal folder, we know which one it's related, too.

[01:58:36]
Ryan Cash: I know we're on our time on the hour here, but I do have some outstanding questions on just, like, what should be the threshold for quality of these first deals that clients are getting? So, like, literally, like, the client's first deal. There's certainly deals that are coming through that are more like... Like fringe cases that I think would be good fits, but I don't know if it should be like the first deal that a client gets is that is kind of like a handshake if they start to work with us, you know? I agree.

[01:59:14]
Athena Simpson: That's exactly what the deal review meetings are for. So like super helpful if you add links and Anke can show you again how to use the agenda. Um, so as those things are coming up, just add it as an agenda point. And then when we get into the meeting later, um, you can talk those through and then we can talk through it as a group. Right. Um, and, and see how we feel because the first one should be a pretty awesome one, but if deal flows light, there's a way that we can position the first one that, Hey, this is a calibration deal. Right. Um, so we've already told them there's going to be a calibration period. There's going to be some gray areas, you know, this one isn't, um, like we don't think that. This one is a hundred percent sure fit, but we don't want it to be. We want you to get some practice in speaking with the broker and the owner. So we can position it depending on what deal flow is looking like. We do want to get them started on deals. And also if the first one is like the most amazing one and they've had no experience whatsoever, like that also kind of sucks, right? They might end up bottling it with the broker or the owner because they just have no experience having those conversations yet. So good questions to have. Absolutely. We want to make sure that we get it right. If you're on the fence with any of those, just bring them to the deal review meetings and we can go through that stuff. That goes for everybody. Cool.

[02:00:41]
Ryan Cash: Sounds awesome. Good stuff.

[02:00:44]
Athena Simpson: Okay. Broker calls. Like I said, Luke is our resident expert because he's had so many, but I wanted to give you guys the context and the why, you know? So just be thinking about like, you know, the brokers are. People we're probably going to talk to multiple times, right? So we need to, AcquiMatch needs to establish a relationship with them. That makes our lives easier when the broker's like you and they feel good about us. And you're going to be coming to them time and time again, right? So if we can build a bridge with them and get them to see the benefit in working with us, then it just makes our lives easier overall. And we also are demonstrating best practice and, you know, representing our clients when we do that. So it's kind of twofold in terms of who we're representing and what we're trying to get out of that conversation. Luke's put together some scripts. There's something that I just started feeding back into. Luke's script is good. Where did it go? Oh, I made a, I made a, um, just a suggestion. Um, but. This script is awesome. The only thing I would add is the other thing that they get concerned about is like whether this person can buy a business, you know, so if they have like a $9 million pre-qualification from Live Oak, like drop it early, you know, because it's like, and they're pre-qualified for $9 million, so they're a qualified buyer. Because the things that brokers are concerned about typically is like, are you going to break confidentiality? Are you going to circumvent me? Are you going to try to split my fees? Is this person legit? Are you wasting my time? Are you a tire kicker? You know, so if you can cover that stuff off early, like I'm not wasting your time. I have somebody that has cash. You're going to like, I'm not going to come after your fee whatsoever. I'm paid independently. And I'm not going to be in the mix messing things up. Like our clients are, we're making the match and then it's over to them. Then usually that, that calms them down a little bit. Good stuff. Okay. We have a call in 30 minutes, so I want to give Luke some time to prepare. You guys have any other questions? If you do, we've got our meeting later today, so you can use that time for, like, Athena questions, context questions, stuff like that, too.

[02:03:25]
Luke Gillespie: Great. How are you feeling?

[02:03:28]
Athena Simpson: Good.

[02:03:29]
Luke Gillespie: Great. Phenomenal. Amazing.

[02:03:33]
Anke Jordaan: Thanks, Luke.

[02:03:34]
Athena Simpson: You got this, Luke.

[02:03:35]
Ryan Cash: A lot, all at once.

[02:03:36]
Athena Simpson: How are you feeling about everything? Sounds like you guys are making good progress.

[02:03:43]
Ryan Cash: Yeah, no, I'm doing good. think, you know, any questions or anything I have is just, like, more, I don't know, procedural stuff, I guess. Like, as I go through the process, there's learning what I don't know, you know? So. But as of now, I'm good. It's just when I start actually getting further through doing stuff, I'm sure I'll have more questions.

[02:04:08]
Athena Simpson: Cool. Anke is your go-to for procedural. You guys are doing daily meetings now, too?

[02:04:13]
Anke Jordaan: We actually have one right now. yeah. Oh, okay.

[02:04:17]
Athena Simpson: Great. Yeah. Cash, as you're going through that stuff, I would just keep a notebook next to you, write down all your questions so that you're just ready for those calls to blast through everything. Because it's all valid. We want you guys to feel comfortable. And you might answer your own question, too. But I just keep a notebook next to me, and I just write down all the stuff, all the Anke questions. I do that to her still. But that's what that time is meant to be for, for you guys to get what you need and answer questions, not for her to tell you what to do. So feel free to use that time to your own benefit and get what you need out of her.

[02:04:54]
Anke Jordaan: Yep. She's doing a great job about it.

[02:04:58]
Charis Siau: Aw.

[02:04:59]
Anke Jordaan: I'm not surprised. I'm

[02:05:00]
Athena Simpson: She's pretty amazing. We're all very lucky to have her.

[02:05:40]
Athena Simpson: Okay, awesome. You guys are doing great. I know it's a lot and it will start to fall into place when you start doing more of it.

So I think. Okay. Okay. Like, like you're I think that's all I want to say. I'm just, I'm happy with how it sounds like it's going. And Anke said the goal this week is every client gets a write-up. So I think if we could do that, that would be phenomenal and set us up really in a good place that we have stuff to be going through on the client calls.

[02:06:20]
Charis Siau: Awesome. All right, cool.

[02:06:22]
Athena Simpson: Luke, I'll see you in 23 minutes. I will let you lead the call. I think you're going to do great. I'm very excited. Got this, Luke.

[02:06:36]
Ryan Cash: Yeah, go Luke!

[02:06:37]
Anke Jordaan: Woo! Thanks.

[02:06:40]
