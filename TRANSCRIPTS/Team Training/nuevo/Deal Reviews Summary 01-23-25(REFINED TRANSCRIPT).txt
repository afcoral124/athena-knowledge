Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): I'm like, seriously, our most risk-averse clients are on the call.

Luke Gillespie: I know.

Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): God, what is Gil going to do after this?

Luke Gillespie: I think that's what our clients need to see.

Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): It's tenacity, right? You're just gonna have to do it. So like, oh, God, Polly and Gil just listen to Mike.

Luke Gillespie: Is it gonna inspire them or is it gonna terrify? I'm like, what's gonna happen?

AcquiMatch Team: If there was a way to say all that, though, it's in his tone and being funny, right? There's a way to talk about the bad stuff, but he did a good job of doing it.

Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Yeah, he's great, isn't he?

[00:01:32]
Luke Gillespie: Yeah, well, I've been meaning to ask him, I was going to reach out to him, ask him to buy him a cup of coffee or something. We've been texting a little bit here and there, but is the towing company in Florida, or is it—because how is he living in Irvine?

Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): I think both companies are actually in Florida.

Luke Gillespie: That's a good question, though. Yeah, I don't want to like boost him on the call, but obviously how are you living in Irvine and running the company in Florida as well?

Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): He moves, he moves her. Fine because he wanted to like start acquiring there, but like he wants his son to like grow up near family and on the coast and stuff. So yeah, I believe the towing company is also here.

Luke Gillespie: Oh, okay.

Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): That's a good question. Yeah, that was fun. It's so fun. Um, it's good to hear like the real perspectives too, you know, it's just like the personality type or you know, the overcoming the resistance to difficult conversations is so important to like tease out and just get them playing like avoiding it before you get into the business is gonna like set you up even worse after because you're gonna have to have it those conversations no matter what, you know, like. So yeah, it was good. Um, cool. So wanted to check in. I apologize. I was like completely shut down. Um, earlier this week. So thank you all for doing amazing jobs and didn't even seem like I needed to be around. It looks like everything was going well and clients were making offers and getting deals. Thank you for looking after things Ryan. Thank you for jumping in on Tuesday too. I heard it went really well. Anka jumping and rearranging everything and appreciate all that. So what I'd love to do today is just real quick talk about the recordings thing and make sure we're covered off there and all on the same page. And then I'd love to just get a status update on where we're at with everything. We got a week left in the month. So how are we looking? Is there any critical things we should know about?

[00:03:39]
Luke Gillespie: Then in just a general update. Does that sound good for today? Yeah. Cool.

[00:03:45]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Okay. So on the recordings and the way we're communicating to clients like how to talk about it and that sort of thing. Like where did we land with that? How have we been communicating it if at all?

AcquiMatch Team: And what are we going to do going forward? So the plan was to on the writeups put underneath the recordings a kind of brief text that kind of explains the situation. So it's a reminder each time they listen to the recording. So I was able to put something together that I thought looked pretty good.

Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): OK, my screen right now. Well, so just just to update. So at this point, we've not had a conversation with clients as part of the onboarding process or anything about how, if at all, they're to refer to those, is that correct?

AcquiMatch Team: No, that's not been in part of the onboarding process.

Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): OK, so we're pretty lucky that it hasn't become a problem up at this point. So the reason why it flagged was because it was like, I'll tell someone so that I've listened to all the calls and I was like, whoa, whoa, no, don't do that, right? So. And that might have been a my bad in the handing over, like not part of the training process or whatever. So, you know, I think. It's one of those gray area things where it hasn't been a problem. I want to make sure it doesn't become a problem and it's something that we just want to stay ahead of both, but just making clients and like, Hey, we're, you know, we know you'll be discretionary. We're giving you the recording so you can have the context. But it's really important that you don't make them feel like big brother was listening in and you just say we've discussed the calls and you've gotten notes from us is is how I would do it in the past, right, rather than saying we've been listening calls kind of haven't been doing that either.

[00:06:00]
Luke Gillespie: No, but I started now since this topic got brought up. Say, can I—is it okay if I record this call for note-taking purposes? And they're generally always cool with it.

[00:06:12]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Yeah. Okay. Yeah, cool. Um, so then we just need to like, I think as part of the onboarding process, Anke, this needs to start with you, it needs to be said and said again, because once won't be enough, like, hey, you know, we provide the recording so you can have context and color. But it's really important. You don't make them feel like you've been listened in on. You know, we tell them we record the calls for note-taking purposes. To just say, we've caught up about the calls and you've been informed on the notes from the calls is what I'm thinking is the positioning—is that where you guys were kind of going with it.

[00:06:46]
Luke Gillespie: Yeah, and I've been mentioning them in my Loom video walkthroughs as well. And now we added in—Ryan and Anke came up with this idea—there's like a disclaimer on every write-up format. Now I just wrote a little disclaimer about it. I can read it off. Yeah, what does it say? It says, note, we record our calls with the broker/seller for you to listen to because we want to provide the best experience for you, our client. We do ask for and receive consent from the broker before recording the call. However, it would be best that you don't mention to the broker and/or seller that you have listened to the call recording, rather just say Luke/Ryan has told me dot dot dot dot.

[00:07:26]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Then it kind of seems like I don't know if I love this disclaimer on the write-up because then it makes it sound like we're doing something shady, you know?

Luke Gillespie: Yeah, okay. How would you like? I think it needs to be a discussion. Okay.

Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): It needs to be part of the on-boarding process when Anke talks about the process, right? Then when Ryan does the first call with them on the write-ups, it's like, hey, you're going to get a write-up, there's going to be recordings of the calls. We'll keep providing these as long as you're being discretionary because we think it would be better for you to have the context rather than just the notes. But it's important for you to say like, hey, I got the notes and caught up with Ryan about the call. So like that because then it seems like I don't want them to feel like they're doing anything wrong. And when you disclaimer like that makes them feel—might make them feel—like they're doing something shady. Or—and maybe this is a wider conversation that we all need to think about—do we stop providing recordings?

[00:08:30]
Luke Gillespie: We just provide notes to the calls? I think that would be a mess. I think a huge value of what we provide to clients is the broker calls. So I think that would be a bad idea, but maybe—how do you feel, Ryan?

[00:09:14]
AcquiMatch Team: You know, I think we can tell the clients, you know, as you're suggesting in the onboarding process or whatnot, say, hey, this is kind of how it's going to go. I don't think that—the reason why I do like a little thing underneath it is because they will forget. I had this conversation with Joe at the very beginning. One of the very first things we did, he was like, should I tell them that I had the calls recording? And I said, I did tell them, but probably best to just say, I've reviewed, you know, the notes—along those lines—just so it doesn't seem like, even if I ask them to record—if I could record it, I didn't ask them, can I show this for everyone? I know, right? So, and he was okay with the idea, that makes sense. And then he repeated, like, I don't want to be like feeling like I'm hiding something, right? So, I think—as anyways, I thought about this and I keep coming back to as long as on the calls we say we're going to be recording this and they give their permission. If it does come up, even though if we slightly coach them not to, if it does come up, we have established that we inform that we're recording the calls. So, I do like them listening to the calls. I think listening to the tone of voice of the broker and how they're talking, you know, opens them to a whole new level of what this business is, especially with the off-market calls. So I do like the actual recordings. I think that's a lot of value. In terms of not including them, you know, maybe if this became a problem, we could be like, okay, we need to shut this down. But I think right now it hasn't. And if we're kind of trying to identify now that it could be a problem and just putting things in place to make sure it doesn't happen, I'd say let's start there. And then if it does become a problem, we could revisit that.

[00:11:27]
Anke Badenhorst: Yeah, I want to note that I think the fact that it hasn't become a problem is by the time our clients listen to the recordings, they have also signed the NDA. And the broker is aware that they've signed the NDA. So if they've signed the NDA, there's nothing that the broker said on the call to Ryan or Luke that they wouldn't have said to the client if they had the conversation with them as well. Maybe that's the reason that it hasn't become a problem is because we signed the NDA, the client signed the NDA.

[00:11:56]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): So the information is shareable. I can't imagine brokers would like be cool with that, to be honest. I think nobody has just stepped in it yet.

AcquiMatch Team: Yeah, I think the NDA is a different scenario than just privacy of conversation, right? It's like the NDA is just like the information about the business; the sharing of the recording is more so it's like I had a conversation with you in confidence and you shared that with someone else without me consenting to that.

[00:12:38]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): So, you know, y'all know how big I am on integrity and that sort of thing. So, I think disclosing that we're recording it for note-taking purposes is great. Luckily, the HubSpot number already informs them of that before they pick up the call. So, like, reiterating it, like, hey, I'm recording this for note-taking purposes. And then, if they don't consent, then you need to stop recording and make sure you're taking notes, okay? Because that's where we could really get into the [trouble] is if they say no, and then we're recording anyway. Then I think it is more a conversation on tactic and strategy and relationship building as part of the onboarding process. Ryan, with your first and second calls and strategy and stuff, just like a reminder, hey, you know, we provide the recording so you can get color on it. But we recommend that you say you listened to the notes just to make sure that the relationship goes smoothly. These guys talk to a bunch of different people. They might not remember whatever, right? So, but if it starts feeling like it's out of hand or we're not getting a handle on it with clients, like the fact that Gil thought that was a good idea. It's like, you know, sometimes we can't get ahead of them. So that's why early and often that we should be like making sure we're reiterating best practices for you to say you've discussed our conversations with us, right?

[00:14:07]
AcquiMatch Team: So to clarify on Gil, he did ask me, can I tell them that I listened to the calls? I said, yes, because I actually prepped that seller for that. So that seller—I said, I'm going to record the calls and share these. Okay, he confirmed. So in that situation, I actually had already told him he can, because I told the seller he'll be listening.

[00:14:35]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Okay, great. So, but like I saw that and I was like, oh, I dropped the ball here somewhere. It wasn't like informing them really on. So that's where panic stations came from, from my perspective, because when I was running, you know, the deals and that sort of thing, I had those conversations with all the clients and not everything gets passed over, but it's like, it's the thing that could be a problem for us. So making sure we're ahead of it before it does become a problem is why we want to have these conversations and things—think about it. The disclaimer, the way you've written it, almost makes it feel like they're doing something naughty to me, so it might be worth maybe having conversations first and then like seeing if we actually need a disclaimer in it because if we hit it too hard, right, and like overemphasize out of nowhere, then they're gonna be like is something wrong? Am I doing something wrong? Am I right? Am I being like complicit in some weird thing? You understand—because we haven't, if we haven't said anything to any of them before apart from like Joe, then for all of a sudden it should just show up as a disclaimer and blah blah blah they might be like is something wrong? Am I lying to them?

[00:15:46]
Luke Gillespie: So we don't want to do that either. Yeah, I get that and I guess the fact that it hasn't come up for this long shows that it maybe wasn't that much of a problem. I thought it would be self-explanatory for our clients not to mention that the calls being recorded. So, but I guess the trade off for us now is deciding on the our client experience on getting to listen to that broker call, or being fully integrous with that broker. And because I'm sure if you—some brokers, the really nice ones will probably be okay with it. I'll say, hey, we try to provide the best experience for our clients. Um, so I do record these calls and show them to my client.

[00:16:24]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): And I'm sure a lot of some of the brokers, I would say that right off the bat with the experience or having or learning how to get through the gatekeepers.

Luke Gillespie: Like they'll definitely shut down.

Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Like it's not—

Luke Gillespie: Yeah. Only the really nice ones are going to allow it. I'd rather have you get through the gatekeeper and not record the call. You know what I'm saying? Cause that's what I'm saying.

Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Yeah.

Luke Gillespie: It's going to turn off brokers to us.

Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): They're going to, yeah. But recording it for note-taking purposes is accurate, right? We're disclosing we're recording it for note-taking purposes and taking notes. Um, so let's keep a real close eye on this and then Anke and Ryan and White want you to like come up with like the right comms and like—you know, I think it's a verbal thing as part of the onboarding process and don't make it a thing. Just be like hey, we record the calls so you can like listen in and get the nuance, but it's really important that you just say that you caught up with us and got the notes when you catch up with them, right? So they don't feel like big brother and everybody's listening—even though they consent to recording. So this is a recommendation when you talk to them is that you caught up with us and you've been filled in our discussion so far. What do you think?

[00:17:41]
AcquiMatch Team: Yeah I've been doing more or less that with Chris, JJ. I've told them, I'm like look, calls are recording—you can access them here—probably just best to not bring it up on the call and you can always just reference that view. But you— I think I always say, I always say, Ryan brought me up to speed, that's what I always say.

[00:18:09]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): To tell them.

AcquiMatch Team: If you're going to reference a call or you saw it here, just say, Ryan informed me and you can always put it on me.
ACTION ITEM: Develop script w/ Ryan for broker consent to share call recordings w/ clients - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/218640014?timestamp=1106.9999
Came for me. Don't need to see where they're from. So I've been doing that. Cool. I mean, we can also potentially just get the permissions from the brokers at the end of the call.
ACTION ITEM: Develop script w/ Luke for broker consent to share call recordings w/ clients - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/218640014?timestamp=1106.9999
If it's cool that goes well and you're planning to do a write-up, Luke, and you're like, you know, going to let them listen to the call, you can end. Like for me, as soon as—like, at the end of the broker call, when I know they're excited about—we're going to introduce a deal to a buyer, then I lay out everything I want because I have them right, yeah. So like, so I'll be like, hey, like remember like you said that some of—you're telling them to send the emails, the NDAs to the clients set after the call. So when I have them, I don't let them go right there. I just go, I don't know, I'll give you the email now and I'll just wait until you send it. That way as soon as I get off the call I know it's set, right? Because as soon as you have them, just get them to do what you want right then and there. Yeah, so another way you could you could use that is that if the conversation's going well, it's a good write-up, you're excited, they're excited, then you can just right there at the end just be like, okay, I'm gonna get with them, I do this little write-up form so they can review everything—so care if I share the calls with them? Get that last confirmation in terms of sharing, you know, and then you're really good, right? So that's another option. I love that idea and maybe sell it to them as to why it's to their benefit right like, hey—

[00:20:00]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): So I recorded the call for my own note-taking purposes. I can share the notes, but what we've seen have better impact, so they're not wasting your time and they're fully caught up, is to be able to listen to this. Are you okay with that, right? Get consent at the end. And we can try all that and see if we're able to do it. Because something, when Ryan took over, I was like sending write-up snippets before getting him to sign the NDAs. And Ryan's like, no, I think we should get them to sign the NDAs first some other way. I don't know if that's gonna work. And it's great. And it's an entire way of doing it. We're maintaining all the broker relationships—is scalable that way. So getting consent at the end for whether we can share it or not. And then some write-ups just aren't gonna have the recordings because the brokers didn't consent to it. That feels better to me, right? Kind of just say you listened to the notes. So if we sell the broker on the reasons why, we're like, the deals that get done quicker and better are the ones where they're able to kind of work—listen in on the conversation and fully catch up. Are you okay with me sharing our conversation with them?

[00:21:05]
Luke Gillespie: What do y'all—uh, I mean, I love that idea in theory.

[00:21:13]
AcquiMatch Team: I just think in reality a lot of brokers probably won't like it, but if that's our strategy, I can do it. But if they say no, then it's good too because then we just know for that client we can't share the call and then we just do the right—

[00:21:27]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): It's just about getting clarity at the app. And then we're doing the right thing because like if the broker finds out that we shared the recording sometimes during the deal and then they blow up the deal because we didn't disclose it or didn't get—you know what I mean—like I just, at scale, it makes me uncomfortable a little bit to be doing this and and I don't like feeling uncomfortable and that would translate to the clients too. So I kind of like this idea better of like at the end, if the call goes well and they're fired up, get consent. Um, and then some write-ups are just not going to have the recordings, and, you know, we'll see how much it impacts being able to get a deal done. And if it doesn't work, we can just change the process again, brother. I mean, we speak to so many brokers and stuff. That's one thing. Right. But I like the end of call—you got them bought in, it was a good conversation. Yeah, so maybe Ryan and Luke, you guys can, like, do some mock calls together, do some practice, get some scripting together for how that might go.

[00:22:41]
Luke Gillespie: Yeah. Yeah. All right. We can do this. I'll do like—I think that's good. Like you said, try to sell them on and be like, hey, I'm really trying to give my client the best experience—

[00:22:50]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): And like I said, no, no, no, no, no. That's not to their benefit.

[00:22:53]
Luke Gillespie: Okay.

[00:22:55]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): You're trying to help them get a deal done. So like you want to sell them on why it's to their benefit.

[00:23:02]
Luke Gillespie: Okay.

[00:23:03]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Not like I'm trying to give my client the best experience, but I don't give a . Right? But like, if you're like, hey, so in our experience, like the deals that have like the, you know, that get done quicker and better are when our clients can like hear our conversation—are you okay with me sharing that with them? You know, like sell it to them as to why it's to their benefit and why it will help them get a deal done better. And then they might get bought in because if you—if you like, I'm just doing my job or, um, you know, like giving my client a good experience and they're like, I don't know who you are. I don't give a . Like you always want to sell people on why it's to their benefit, not yours.

[00:23:49]
Luke Gillespie: That's a good point. Yeah. All right. Yeah. And I'll trial it with a more expendable deal flow like Chris or something. I can't risk talking up a rare Andrew Oklahoma.

[00:24:01]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): I'd say start, start, start doing it when you feel confident and you've had a good call. Like when you're like, that call went really well. Now I'm feeling good. I'm confident. Let me try it, right? And you'll build up your kind of like confidence around it, but work with Ryan on it because he's so good with the broker calls and like how to, how to place that and how to have those conversations.

[00:24:23]
Luke Gillespie: I think you can script a few things together. So you can just read it off at the end when you're feeling good. Yep. Yeah, we can talk.

[00:24:31]
AcquiMatch Team: I actually—I've been thinking this as you guys have been talking. I already have a script in my head that we can do it.

[00:24:37]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Good. I like this. I feel a lot better about this. I think we should try to let it see if it works. And, and then maybe this is something we roll out like we did with the NDA.

[00:24:45]
Luke Gillespie: But we're just operating from a place of integrity across the board. That's really what we want to do. Sounds good.

AcquiMatch Team: Yep.

Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): And it's something that's been on my mind and bothering me since we started. So like it's getting big enough now that we have to start being a bit more above board on this stuff because people are noticing, right? The thing today, like it was 60 people in there listening to, you know, about what we're doing and lots of lenders and lawyers and everything in the room. So we want to be above board about everything where we can. So at certain points, you know, we bootstrap things and we do things because it gets us by. And then as we grow and get bigger, we have to look at these things through a different lens than whenever we got started. So thank you for indulging not all of that.

[00:25:41]
AcquiMatch Team: I also want to say I have a call at the top of hour with Jason about his deal.

[00:25:46]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Exciting. Okay, cool. So let's start with, is there—we've got a week left in the month. So is there anything I should be aware of knowing that? And then we can go into to just general updates on deals or anything that you want to chat through with me today. Sound good?

[00:26:06]
AcquiMatch Team: Yeah, yeah, yeah, I would say just to start off there then—number one we've talked about as far that this is—you could be a just, you know, he's coming up um, potentially the end so we're trying to get him as much deal flow as possible. We presented him an online business and then we've done two temperature checks with him recently on a business in Texas and an online business—a smaller business, but he's expressed interest in that business model. So we're—we're just firing what we do right now. So that's where I'm with him. In terms of like concerned, right—sorry, the second one is probably just Jason, not in terms of age, before we move on. Sure.

[00:26:55]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): We got the the leads guy working yet.
ACTION ITEM: Follow up w/ leads gen company re: timeline for first leads - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/218640014?timestamp=1616.9999

[00:26:58]
Anke Badenhorst: Uh, yeah—up and running, so we're basically just waiting for the first leads to come in.

[00:27:04]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): How long does he anticipate before that happens?

[00:27:07]
Anke Badenhorst: They can't guarantee like that, but they say it was up and running the day after Ryan had the onboarding call. We got the email that it's up and running, so I'll check in today if they need anything else from us—when can we anticipate the first lead?

[00:27:27]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Okay, and have you followed up with Brian yet?

[00:27:30]
Anke Badenhorst: I'm working on Brian, so I'm working through the stuff that I need to respond to Brian.
ACTION ITEM: Schedule call w/ Ryan & Brian to discuss Brian's questions - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/218640014?timestamp=1650.9999

[00:27:36]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Okay, when you reckon you'll be able to do that?

[00:27:41]
Anke Badenhorst: I wanted to respond to him today, but the questions that he asked feels like a bit outside of the scope that I can answer him, so I think we need to get with Ryan on getting those answers to him.

[00:27:54]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Why don't you guys just schedule a call? Was Brian? Yeah, yeah.

[00:28:01]
Anke Badenhorst: Yeah, I think that's a good idea. I'll check with Ryan the best time and then I'll schedule with Brian.

[00:28:07]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Yeah, Brian.

[00:28:08]
Anke Badenhorst: Yeah, just so I can just get on a call with him so he can like work up his—he's got to get a proposal over to me and that's going to take some time too.

[00:28:16]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): So I just don't want to hold up that process from happening. So he said if it's too hard to install this on email, let's just jump on a call.

[00:28:23]
AcquiMatch Team: Quicker for me to do it that way. Okay, great. Jason—you were going to say? Ryan, carry on. Yes, I didn't mean to keep continuing on. I'm going to start. Yeah, give me a pause after each call.

[00:28:35]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): I know. I did this every time.

[00:28:38]
AcquiMatch Team: Wait, wait—Jason—everything's good with Jason though. I think we only have one right at first. So Luke actually had another one that we are excited about and the broker just decided to go on vacation for a week starting today, Luke.

[00:28:58]
Luke Gillespie: Yeah, well, we don't know how long he's on. All I got was that he's traveling starting today.

[00:29:04]
AcquiMatch Team: So, so we need—if there's another concern, it's—we need to get Jason another write-up before the end of the month.

[00:29:12]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Okay.

Luke Gillespie: I don't think Jason is the concern, though. We've talked about JB as the concern.

Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): So, but we will be able to get Jason another one before the end of the month.

[00:29:21]
Luke Gillespie: Yeah.

[00:29:23]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): We'll get the contract check-in.

[00:29:25]
AcquiMatch Team: So let's get him something. Exactly. That's why I said he's—and then Luke just referenced JB. We haven't got him a second deal, but I mean, I think we may be close. I think there's—I think there might be an LOI done here in the next, you know, week. So they had a meeting today. We—me and Joe—talked about it. Yeah, I went. It was good enough that if there is some back and forth, I think it's all within the range of getting done, right? So I feel really good about that one. Yeah, so if there was a concern about—

[00:30:11]
Anke Badenhorst: He sent over the Cool Wizards LOI draft and model. He sent that over to you, Ryan and Athena, a while ago. Not a while ago, just a bit ago.

[00:30:24]
AcquiMatch Team: So I did tell him I would review that with you, which was going to be the next thing. Although I was looking at it before this. He didn't fill out the LOI template. He left a lot of it blank. So I told him, like, get it final in draft so we can review and he didn't do that. But we can look at the model.

[00:30:43]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): I'll get it all together so that I— you know, back to back all day tomorrow too. So it's just, I'll try to do it in between things. Then worst case, we can do it on our catch up tomorrow.

[00:30:57]
AcquiMatch Team: Okay, cool. I can tell him that. Um, I told him I would review it with you tonight, he said he really wants—and I actually pushed him—I said, I think you should try to submit this by end of day tomorrow. Um, he was like, okay, tell me what you have, try to get as close to completion as possible, and I will review it with Athena. Uh, so we could do it.

[00:31:20]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Yeah, I'm—I gotta go back upstairs really two more hours.

[00:31:25]
AcquiMatch Team: No problem.

[00:31:26]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): I can. Check with me before you give up and timings like that, uh, just, just to make sure. Um, but yeah, tomorrow during our catch up, we'll have time to do it.

[00:31:35]
AcquiMatch Team: Okay, I didn't promise anything. I just said, okay—it was more of a, I said, oh, let's do this for you. I didn't—you didn't ask for it or anything. I said, doesn't have to be—I'll look at it. I had some time with a—that was all.

[00:31:47]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Yeah, I'm gonna fill out the LOI though. I like looked at the call notes and it said the seller didn't want like legalese and stuff like that, which made me a little weary about what Joe wants to submit.

[00:31:59]
AcquiMatch Team: They don't want what?

[00:32:00]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): This is—seller didn't want like legalese in the LOI—something like that—or it was in your call notes with Joe. The conversation you had with him earlier, the seller doesn't want an LOI template, or what was the crux of that conversation?

[00:32:21]
AcquiMatch Team: I don't remember any of that.

[00:32:24]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): No? Okay. Well, Fathom then pulled really weird notes because it said that the seller didn't want to sign something that looked like a legal document.

[00:32:35]
Anke Badenhorst: Okay.

AcquiMatch Team: Yeah. Now, the conversation was, I talked with the seller before the meeting, and I said, Joe, don't try to push him to sign anything when you're there. This is just a conversation. Even if you guys agree on everything, send them the LOI tomorrow. Don't try to get him to sign up with people. He said he doesn't want to be pressured about signing those.

[00:32:56]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Got it. Fathom pulled some weird notes. Let's then look at that note set Fathom's pulling and make sure that it's like—because we're sending those to clients now. So just have a check of the ones that Eda's posting and make sure—not right this second—but just have a quality check to make sure that—because I was like, I wanted to know what was going on, so I checked and I was like, okay. Um, but yeah, if you can get Joe to fill out the template tonight then that way you and I can review it tomorrow on our call. He'll get feedback before midday and then he can get something over to the seller end of day. Perfect. Awesome. Nice work on that. Okay.

[00:33:33]
AcquiMatch Team: So we need another—well, he's probably focused on that—but ideally we want another JB too, right? Exactly. I was just saying like, okay, if you're concerned with JB is—if something happens and this doesn't start—he's gonna immediately think, look, the next thing. So let's get him something and we—we haven't found anything really good lately, so that's a little bit concerning, but I got—you know, I like where he is in this current. This is the best we've ever been with JB at this very moment, like those close together something.

[00:34:06]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Okay, um, let's check in on it early this week, see where we're at, and if we need to have a conversation with him—we've been diverting your resources to supporting him on this off-market, and just deal flow has been a little bit slow in January. I think he's probably a little bit more understanding, and especially now that we have something for him to sink his teeth in. Jason has wanted to concern with me, because he's monthly contract checking us. Okay, cool. How are the rest of them looking?

[00:34:40]
Luke Gillespie: We will meet contract minimums for all of them, and definitely Jason—don't worry about that. Got it.

[00:34:49]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Nice work, y'all. Okay, so how are the rest of the client's students?

[00:34:53]
Anke Badenhorst: How's Jenny doing on her—she making an offer? Where is she at?

[00:34:58]
Luke Gillespie: Yeah, I hit her with two write-ups this week. So, nice job.

[00:35:04]
AcquiMatch Team: I've never reviewed the ones that I put—the one looked good. She just messaged Ryan, I think.

[00:35:10]
Luke Gillespie: She said she's having a call with Barlow Williams tomorrow and hoping to get the LOI out ASAP after that.

[00:35:52]
Luke Gillespie: Oh, great.

[00:35:53]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): So, she's gonna make an offer. It's still available. That's exciting. We've looked at the modeling and everything. We're getting her other opportunities so she's able to like gut check the one that she's on. How's that going right with her?

[00:36:07]
AcquiMatch Team: I'm sorry—go ahead, Luke.

Luke Gillespie: There was a power washing business I just submitted to her this weekend. I introduced her to the broker today—she wants to meet the broker—so I think things are going well with Jin.

[00:36:19]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Nice work. How's her confidence level?

[00:36:26]
AcquiMatch Team: I think she'll get—she's bright—so she'll just pick up more confidence as she gets more experience.

[00:36:35]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Great. How about Jason? How's he doing on his LOI?

[00:36:44]
AcquiMatch Team: So Jason broke down terms on a sheet, went to meet with the seller and it seems like they've got to an agreement on terms and they've signed a piece of paper on terms but it's not an LOI. So my conversation with him after this is going to be about what to put in the LOI—but the LOI don't—he's still like hesitant on being pushy about this. Like, well, I don't know if that's necessary. Like, maybe this is enough. I'm like, put it. If that's going to be a problem, then just hash it out right now, you know. So I have a call with him here in 15, 12 minutes about what to do next. I'm going to be like, great, awesome—got him to accept the seller note. And they've agreed on the 1.7 million price. That's completely Jason. They had the exact conversation—I told him—he's told me to have with him, which is, is this the business? Because he's pushing up the price higher than initially said, right? Like, I told him, like, you initially want to offer 1.4, I think you can save 1.5, 1.6, we say 1.7, which is higher than you initially said you were open to—now you're going 1.7. Well, I think this is a great business—is this—and okay, as long as you think that, but realize like the debt service is getting weaker, you understand that, right? I said, now look, we played with the model, if you get some growth, you're fine, but if you don't get growth, you're in trouble, and he's like, okay, well that's your decision, you know, telling you, me, I would probably try to get back to 1.6. So, he's like, okay—he left, we came back, like, we're at 1.7, so looks like he's going to move forward to 1.7. He wants to ask me if in the note he should—if in the—if in the LOI he should put seller agrees to a note between five to ten percent, or just try to get him to sign on 10 percent. The reason is that Jason's been saying the bank is going to want you to hold a note and the seller is saying, well, let's get in front of a bank and see what they say. He's like, I'm willing to hold five–ten percent if that's what the bank is saying they want. And so he's like, should I put five–ten percent and then go with the bank? Or should I say five or ten percent direct instead of a range? That's what he wants to talk to me about that coffee hour. So he's gonna need a signed LOI.

[00:39:37]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): To get financing. Right, so even if he doesn't want to sign the document, he's not gonna get taken seriously by lenders if he doesn't have a signed LOI. That's what they're gonna ask for—they're gonna ask for his modeling, they're gonna ask for his LOI when he goes out to start getting term sheets. So put 10%, and if the guy will sign, then 5%, right? The bank doesn't care whether the seller takes a note or not. So he's not giving the guy accurate information. But like what we were talking about earlier with Mike, like he's not going to get 100% at close. So either you take it as a note and you get interest on it, or it's held back in indemnification, right?

[00:40:26]
AcquiMatch Team: Oh, that was a holdback, though.

Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): At least a year.

AcquiMatch Team: That's the bank requires that.

Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): No, he should. Like that is a good legal team behind you—it's like you give him 100% at close—if there's fraud or anything like you get nothing back.

AcquiMatch Team: No, I'm not that screw.

Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): So that's—that's like any good lawyer will make sure that you're holding back something in escrow. It's not the bank's requirement, but like we should not be advising buyers ever to give 100% at close, and they should have a legal team that's also advising them of that, right? Because if there's any fraud or any issues that come up, they're not going to be able to get that money back. So there should be money going into an escrow account and then they get after a year. And that is standard. Like I hear up to 30% of the purchase—gotcha. So is Jason going to get legal advice at this point?

[00:41:36]
AcquiMatch Team: Is he just signing an app again? No, he's—he's got with bottom lawyers.

[00:41:43]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Okay, so get a signed LOI—you know, shoot for 10% ideally. But if he only signs five, that's fine too. The banks that are going to requirement and then like after he's under offer and starts going through the lending process—which is he's going to get his handed to. You know why—he's gonna have to sell—he's gonna have to give them the modeling, he's gonna have to defend his position, the whole thing. Once he gets a term sheet or they start looking under the hood on the business, then like—then he can kind of use ends like, well, this is what's going on—whatever the Q of E—you can do a re-trade if he needs to. So I think at this point like it's a small enough margin that like he can sign the deal. But he needs—he needs to have a good LOI in place, you know, for the lending process—for what comes next. That's what I would advise him to—like lenders are gonna be like, you don't even have a signed LOI? Like okay, like I'm kind of give you some feedback on this or whatever, but like it's to his interest to have a signed LOI. And I'm glad he's talking about the Williams too, so—

[00:43:00]
AcquiMatch Team: Okay, good. Okay.

[00:43:01]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Cool. Um, exciting times all around. How's Chris doing?

[00:43:06]
AcquiMatch Team: Chris is great. We got of two businesses who like, he likes them both. Um, I even told him about that off-market warehouse business in the Northeast that has like five different locations because I just told—they have an off market and I haven't found for anyone. I just want to run it by you. That sounds interesting. He's like, let's do it. So, uh, so I'm going to start looking and maybe writing that up for him.

[00:43:31]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Are they still interested in selling?

[00:43:33]
AcquiMatch Team: Have you engaged with them? I talked with them right before Christmas and they were like—and I was like, guys, I'm sorry, I have not found anybody for you guys. I can keep looking though. I still have more clients so I can keep looking and they're like, okay, just keep looking. I said, okay. And then so that's why it was on my mind and we were talking. He's like, I'm flying to New York. And one of the places is in New York and I said, hey, what do you think about this? And I told him about it. And he's like, yeah, let's do it. So, um, I'm gonna try to do that as well. Love it.

[00:44:05]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): . Yeah, let's go. Yeah, Chris is doing great.

[00:44:08]
Luke Gillespie: He's being aggressive. He should have had a broker call today for the self-order roofing company and then there's a Texas career company as well. He introduced him to the broker the day I sent him the write-up. So yeah. Awesome, and Gil, how's he doing?

[00:44:24]
AcquiMatch Team: It was good. He's got a big, big week. Got a seller call scheduled for him tomorrow. You're getting a seller call with an on-market deal next week. So he's—he's busy. And you're getting him past the resistance, so you're getting him to start taking action. What was the game changer there? He said he watched that video that we did about the relationships—that he was like, okay, I understand what you guys are saying now.

[00:44:52]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): That's what he said. Yeah, let's go. Um, have we heard from Alex?

[00:45:03]
AcquiMatch Team: No, we checked on with her once a week? Not this week. We checked with her last week.

[00:45:10]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Okay. Let's make sure we're going to pulse on her and checking and seeing how she's doing. Uh, Brian, anything there? Did he look at the gas station? We heard, I don't have our call with him on.

[00:45:25]
AcquiMatch Team: Tuesday, um, and I went over the businesses with him. I said, hey, why don't you put together your thoughts and send them to me by Wednesday at the same time. He said, okay. He hasn't done it. I thought that was today. I haven't heard back yet. So I'll keep following up with him.

[00:45:41]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Cool. Yeah. Let's just keep—like on the clients that are ghosting a little bit, like let's be the one chasing them and not not allowing them to continue to ghost us, right? Um, who am I missing? Is that everyone?

[00:45:55]
Anke Badenhorst: It's me.

[00:45:57]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Oh, yeah.

[00:46:00]
Luke Gillespie: SP—we got them one write-up and they weren't interested in the business and now I don't have anything right now that I'm going to do a write-up for, but I'm sure I'll find something next week and I also have an online business that I might repurpose for them.

[00:46:16]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Okay and then it sounded like Polly's feedback that the business we handed them was outside of the industries they were interested in, do we know what happened in there?

[00:46:25]
AcquiMatch Team: Yeah they said that they weren't interested in retail but they have told me—Ryan, just send us things. They're like, we're okay with going outside of the industries that we initially selected, send us things so we can think things through; like we'd rather just see volume and so we brought that to me and I said, no, let's let's send that to—it's a retail store, it's not rocket science to take that thing over—long history—so it was together. Yes, we put it together and I said, let's just skip their feedback and we just get them looking at something. So, they just said no and I explained why we chose to send it to them and we won't wait for them anymore.

[00:47:14]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Okay. Did we have the come to Jesus with them about like either Polly needs to start taking calls or they need to move quicker or make time available for Steve?

[00:47:25]
AcquiMatch Team: I covered all those points with her and I told her this is what I think—told them you guys back. She said, I agree. We'll try to do it that way. They said, hey, why don't you, instead of trying to be on the same call at time, get Steve to provide all his feedback on paper for you and then come to the seller call if he can't make it. With those questions—if he really likes the business, it goes well—you can always try to get them on the second call.

[00:47:49]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Okay. What are the chances of us getting two more to them before the end of the month?

[00:47:56]
AcquiMatch Team: No, we got two of them this month, right? Got the landscaping business and we got—

[00:48:00]
Luke Gillespie: Uh, the retail store. Right. Oh okay—so if we get them one more, then it'll be two that were in their buy box. Yeah, one more. Okay, so three in total. And because that content site that we mentioned for Andrew—I feel like Andrew is probably not gonna like it—so I was thinking of having that for SP because it's an SP—they love content sites—it's one of those absentee low SDE opportunities. So yeah, awesome. Uh, it sounds like everything is in a really great place, y'all. Yeah—anything else you should be aware of or anything I can help you all with? No, I have two write-ups for AA that I'm—we're just waiting to submit and the one, like, I wrote it the first week—like January 3rd—and so I reached out to the broker today: hey, my buyer's dealing with some health issues right now, they can't make decision to move for—
ACTION ITEM: Check in w/ AA re: 2 ready write-ups, mention exciting opportunities - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/218640014?timestamp=2939.9999
Or do you—just let me know, we'll reach back out to you. So the guy said, all right, thanks for letting me know. So it looks like it's still on the market. Hopefully we haven't burned any bridges. So yeah.

[00:49:10]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Have we checked in with her and said that we have write-ups ready for her? Like see if that brings her out of hiding?

[00:49:19]
Luke Gillespie: No. I think—I'll [ping] you tomorrow.

[00:49:23]
AcquiMatch Team: I need to follow up with her, so I'll do that for her.

[00:49:26]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): OK, great.

[00:49:28]
Luke Gillespie: Tell her like we have—we have two exciting opportunities. We'd love to show you—want you to get back.

[00:49:33]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): So. Amazing. I'm so proud of y'all. Like I'm here and I'm just like talking about how amazing my team is. And like I was like, we got three clients making offers already this year. It's awesome. You know, it feels really good. Also, I want to watch the Justin—I know, I know we're at time and you got to run, but I want to hear the Justin update too.

So anything else before we log off?
ACTION ITEM: Share Joe's LOI & model in Slack - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/218640014?timestamp=2992.9999

[00:49:58]
AcquiMatch Team: Not a cut.

[00:50:00]
Anke Badenhorst: My internet cut out for like 10 seconds while we were talking about Joe. Not sure if you guys heard me—Joe sent over an LOI with the model on email to you, Athena, and Ryan. I'll make sure that's on your dashboard, Athena. Okay, and Ryan said he hadn't filled out that LOI. I got it on email.

[00:50:18]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Oh. Okay, can you drop it in Slack?

[00:50:23]
AcquiMatch Team: Sure, but that's what—that's what I'm saying: if you open up that LOI, it didn't go out—so if there's a lot of blank stuff. So anyways, I'm gonna message him, but that's probably when you got cut out. Wicked. You guys rock.
