[Error #1 - Category: Misheard Acronym/Term]
Location: Approx. 22:30–28:00 / Speaker: Athena Simpson
Transcript excerpt: “...if there’s big changes, like one year, the SCE margin is 50%, the next year it’s 20%...”
Issue: “SCE” used where SDE is clearly intended (they are discussing SDE margin and SDE vs EBITDA).
Likely intended: “SDE margin”
Confidence: High
Reasoning: The topic is SDE margin thresholds and variability; “SCE” is not a relevant metric.
Impact: High

---
[Error #2 - Category: Misheard Acronym/Term]
Location: ~45:00–46:00 / Speaker: Athena Simpson
Transcript excerpt: “...it was actually only a $1.5 million SCE business.”
Issue: “SCE” should be SDE in context of adjusted owner benefit and cash-flow.
Likely intended: “$1.5 million SDE business”
Confidence: High
Reasoning: The example compares adjusted EBITDA and owner benefit; SDE is the standard in SMB deals.
Impact: High

---
[Error #3 - Category: Entity Name (Company)]
Location: 1:48 / Speaker: Ryan Cash
Transcript excerpt: “...welcome to Aquamatch video with an Anka rap video.”
Issue: Company name appears as “Aquamatch.”
Likely intended: “AcquiMatch”
Confidence: High
Reasoning: The company is AcquiMatch; “Aquamatch” is a common ASR phonetic error.
Impact: Medium

---
[Error #4 - Category: Entity Name (Person)]
Location: 1:29 / Speaker: Athena Simpson
Transcript excerpt: “Okay, so like now I’m picturing Anka rapping.”
Issue: “Anka” vs “Anke” (Anke Jordaan).
Likely intended: “Anke”
Confidence: High
Reasoning: The participant is listed as Anke; inconsistency appears multiple times.
Impact: Medium

---
[Error #5 - Category: Entity Name (Person)]
Location: 5:55 / Speaker: Athena Simpson
Transcript excerpt: “...give some clarity, passion, ask for some training on that.”
Issue: “passion” in this context likely refers to Ryan “Cash” asking for training.
Likely intended: “Cash had asked for some training on that.”
Confidence: High
Reasoning: “Cash” is a team member’s surname; “passion” is semantically out of place.
Impact: Medium

---
[Error #6 - Category: Misheard Word/Homophone]
Location: 0:11 / Speaker: Luke Gillespie
Transcript excerpt: “It’s like elevated music. Did you play music?”
Issue: “elevated music” likely should be “elevator music.”
Likely intended: “It’s like elevator music.”
Confidence: High
Reasoning: Standard idiom; context is background hold music.
Impact: Low

---
[Error #7 - Category: Speaker Misattribution]
Location: 0:15 / Speaker: Ryan Cash
Transcript excerpt: “Did you play piano, Anke? I do, yeah.”
Issue: The “I do, yeah” affirmation is likely Anke’s response, not Ryan’s.
Likely intended: Second sentence attributed to Anke.
Confidence: High
Reasoning: Q&A structure mismatch; the respondent should be Anke.
Impact: Medium

---
[Error #8 - Category: Omission/Truncation]
Location: 2:26 / Speaker: Anke Jordaan
Transcript excerpt: “I’m not that young. don’t think Luke will know it, though.”

Reasoning: Grammatical omission typical of ASR.
Impact: Low

---
[Error #9 - Category: Omission/Truncation]
Location: 3:33 / Speaker: Ryan Cash
Transcript excerpt: “was, like, eight watching a sitcom about these people at a bar...”
Issue: Missing subject “I.”
Likely intended: “I was, like, eight...”
Confidence: High
Reasoning: ASR drop of initial pronoun.
Impact: Low

---
[Error #10 - Category: Misheard/Distorted Phrase]
Location: 41:08 / Speaker: Athena Simpson
Transcript excerpt: “...Luke looked at a deal for one of our clients and it’s with benchmarks. So they do the whole thing where clients have to sign the NDA...”
Issue: “benchmarks” likely refers to the broker “Benchmark International.”
Likely intended: “with Benchmark (International)”
Confidence: Medium
Reasoning: Benchmark International is a known broker; plural “benchmarks” doesn’t fit.
Impact: Medium

---
[Error #11 - Category: Misheard Acronym]
Location: 29:21 / Speaker: Ryan Cash
Transcript excerpt: “...least likely that’s going to be in a SEM. And it’s definitely not...”
Issue: “SEM” should be “SIM” (Confidential Information Memorandum).
Likely intended: “in a SIM”
Confidence: High
Reasoning: SIM is the standard document in brokered deals; SEM is unrelated here.
Impact: Medium

---
[Error #12 - Category: Garbled/ASR Artifact]
Location: ~12:14 (just before screen share) / Speaker: Athena Simpson
Transcript excerpt: “...so that when you guys are in that moment, you have the reference there to refer. Thank Thank Thank Where is this?”
Issue: Repetitive filler/garble not coherent.
Likely intended: “Thanks... Where is this?” or similar single acknowledgment.
Confidence: High
Reasoning: Repetition and abrupt shift indicate ASR artifact.
Impact: Low

---
[Error #13 - Category: Garbled/ASR Artifact]
Location: ~24:00 / Speaker: Athena Simpson
Transcript excerpt: “...it’s a value add, but also now. very man. you. I need to ask a whole bunch of questions...”
Issue: Garbled, fragmented phrase interrupts meaning.
Likely intended: Smooth continuation about questions to ask regarding WIP/recurring contracts.
Confidence: Medium

Impact: Low

---
[Error #14 - Category: Garbled/ASR Artifact]
Location: ~25:30 / Speaker: Athena Simpson
Transcript excerpt: “...it could be be. Moved to a different designation...”
Issue: Duplicate/misaligned words.

Confidence: High
Reasoning: Stutter-like duplication is typical ASR artifact.
Impact: Low

[Error #15 - Category: Terminology Clarity]
Location: 41:30–44:30 / Speaker: Athena Simpson
Transcript excerpt: “...if the majority, like more than 50% of their sales come from one acquisition channel... Let’s say more, 50%.”
Issue: “more, 50%” likely intended as “more than 50%.”
Likely intended: “more than 50%”
Confidence: High
Reasoning: Standard threshold phrasing; “more, 50%” is an ASR hiccup.
Impact: Low

---
[Error #16 - Category: Terminology Distortion]
Location: ~21:00 / Speaker: Athena Simpson
Transcript excerpt: “...even though this might be like a value adder.”
Issue: “value adder” vs standard “value add.”

Impact: Low

---
[Error #17 - Category: Misheard/Clarity]
Location: 5:13 / Speaker: Charis Siau
Transcript excerpt: “...same thing that I think we’re going to be covering in yours as well with Jim on the scorecard.”
Issue: “Jim” unclear; no “Jim” referenced elsewhere; may be misheard.
Likely intended: Possibly “in the scorecard” or “the GM/with that on the scorecard”
Confidence: Low-Medium
Reasoning: No other reference to a person named Jim; could be ASR hallucination.
Impact: Low

---
[Error #18 - Category: Omission/Word Choice]
Location: 31:32 / Speaker: Athena Simpson
Transcript excerpt: “...day one, you’re running around off the owner, around after the owner and documenting everything...”
Issue: “off the owner” likely meant “after the owner.”
Likely intended: “running around after the owner”

Impact: Low

---
[Error #19 - Category: Brand Name Consistency]
Location: 8:41 / Speaker: Athena Simpson
Transcript excerpt: “...real estate from an Acquimatch standpoint.”
Issue: Brand casing/variant inconsistent with “AcquiMatch.”
Likely intended: “AcquiMatch”
Confidence: High
Reasoning: Consistency with company naming preferred.
Impact: Low

Segments to remove

---
[REMOVAL #1 - Type: Personal/Off-Topic/Small Talk]
Location: 0:00–4:29
Speakers involved: Anke, Luke, Ryan, Athena, Charis
Content excerpt:
“Anke: ...very bad quality piano music in the background...
Luke: It’s like elevated [elevator] music...
Ryan: Did you play piano, Anke?...
Athena: ...story all about how some EBITDA got turned upside down...
[Multiple lines about Fresh Prince, Roseanne, Cheers, Married with Children, Saved by the Bell, Friends...]”
Reasoning:
Extended small talk about background music, instruments, rapping, and TV nostalgia. No connection to acquisition, deals, scorecard, or client work.
Context impact: None—business discussion starts cleanly at 4:29 (“Well, so good stuff today...”).
Recommended action: REMOVE lines 0:00–4:29
---

Borderline segments requiring review

---
[BORDERLINE #1 - Requires Review]
Location: 57:39–58:01
Content excerpt: “Athena: We got Buyers Club now. I got to run to the bathroom. But we can circle back on all this... let’s find some time maybe for all of us tomorrow to go through this...”
Business relevance argument: Contains scheduling/next steps about continuing training and deal review (relevant to workflow).
Personal content argument: “I got to run to the bathroom” is a personal aside.
Recommendation: KEEP with minor trimming if desired—remove only the bathroom remark to keep next steps intact.
---

Additional segment mapping (business content)
- 4:29–8:10 KEEP: Meeting purpose; deal reviews; scorecard training plan; action items; screen share setup.
- 8:10–14:50 KEEP: Real estate 101 recommendation; Buyer’s Club video; plan for AcquiMatch-specific real estate training.
- 14:50–19:30 KEEP: Revenue growth metric; multi-year trends; COVID normalization context.
- 18:21–22:00 KEEP: SDE vs EBITDA clarification; ensure correct use in write-ups.
- 22:00–33:00 KEEP: SDE margin thresholds; variability; recurring/contracted revenue and WIP; operator-in-place; remote vs relocatable definitions; SOPs importance and verification.
- 33:00–41:00 KEEP: Scorecard usage; key man risk; client concentration and structuring (forgivable note).
- 41:00–45:30 KEEP: Revenue volatility; narrative for declines; single supplier/channel threshold guidance.
- 45:30–49:55 KEEP: Heavy/non-recurring CapEx; depreciation as proxy; cash businesses/poor books; seasonality; project-based revenue; multiple owners and proper add-back treatment.
- 49:55–58:01 KEEP: Scorecard notes practices; ad-backs template; SBA pre-qual; performance notes; market trends; client-specific flags (flooring margins; Tampa geo/owner presence); scheduling follow-up.

Speaker attribution validation notes
- 0:15 line contains a likely misattribution (question and affirmative answer both tagged to Ryan Cash). The “I do, yeah” should belong to Anke.
- Several ASR garbles likely caused fragmented or incomplete sentences; these do not appear to swap roles elsewhere, but reviewers should watch for subtle attributions around 0:46–1:00 due to overlapping chatter.

Cross-reference consistency checks
- SDE consistently misrendered as “SCE” in a few places; ensure all financial analysis references SDE vs EBITDA correctly.
- SIM vs SEM: use “SIM” for Confidential Information Memorandum.
- Company name: standardize on “AcquiMatch.”
- Person name: standardize on “Anke” (not Anka).

Actionable notes for transcript refiner
- Correct SDE mishearings and brand/name inconsistencies.
- Clean obvious ASR garble lines where meaning is broken but easy to infer.
- Remove the 0:00–4:29 small-talk block.
- Optionally trim the bathroom aside at 57:39 while retaining scheduling/next steps.
