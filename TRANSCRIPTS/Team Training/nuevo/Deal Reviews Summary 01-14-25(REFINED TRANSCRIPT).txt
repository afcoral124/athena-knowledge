[00:00:09]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): That was good. I love it. I love it when we actually have some client interaction.

[00:00:14]
Luke Gillespie: Yeah, that was awesome. And I'm glad Chris is excited about the roofing business.

[00:00:20]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): It's good. We got them all.

[00:00:22]
Luke Gillespie: Is that off market? Also? Oh, it was on market.

[00:00:25]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Okay. Yeah.

[00:00:27]
Luke Gillespie: Is that my guy coming next week?

[00:00:29]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): The one in urban that I'm supposed to meet. Awesome.

[00:00:32]
Luke Gillespie: I texted him this morning.

[00:00:34]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): I mean, I love him so much. He's been a huge supporter of me and us. So our latest client is the result of him recommending us actually.

[00:00:44]
Luke Gillespie: Wow.

[00:00:45]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Awesome. Yeah, he's just fun too. Like he's got such a great energy and. Really active in the searcher space in the searcher community. So he's bought two businesses using SBA loan. wants to get rid of, but he's locked in with SBA and the other that he loves and he's like doing like more acquisitions and stuff. So he's like, I would love to come and talk to your crew. And I'm like, awesome. I've been wanting to bring a, you know, acquirer on to talk through things.

[00:01:15]
Luke Gillespie: So I think that'll be good. Yeah, that would be great.

[00:04:57]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Well I know we ran a little bit over we're getting a little bit late start we need to wrap up at five this is probably get kicked out of his co-working space so just some updates on my side, I met Brian, who worked at Athletic Greens, actually is part of our interview process earlier this year, and his skillset is really in growth, marketing, and like in particular he's sold businesses, he has a lot of direct mail experience and like understands how to analyze the data to be able to, you know, do specific things to see if that's helping us get the results that we want. So I told them it was like, look, I want more off-market leads, and I don't think we're like hitting every channel the way that we can. I believe the direct mail and doing some Facebook ads and, you know, trying some different things out might bring us some more opportunities where we're not so reliant on market. But the team is just processing what we have. So none of us really have the capacity to kind of step out and start trialing some of these things so He's super excited was already giving me lots of ideas and what he wants to try out, so he's going to be sending me over proposal provided we can afford it. I want to do a trial on the markets that we're struggling with with clients right now to see if we can generate some. Oh, looks like I dropped. Okay.

[00:07:23]
Luke Gillespie: He's connecting back.

[00:07:25]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Okay.

[00:07:27]
AcquiMatch Team: Sorry.

[00:07:28]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): No worries. I thought I thought you just went off camera so let me let me back up real quick.

[00:07:34]
AcquiMatch Team: Yeah, Brian.

[00:07:37]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Yeah, Brian. You sort of athletic green, but has a ton of direct mail experience analyzing data and like getting actions taken so. And is really interested in ETA has sold, you know, websites himself. And I, I told him like I want. to do more with off-market owners, but none of us have the bandwidth of the capacity to try some of these things out. So, you know, if those leads come in, the team knows what to do with them, but it's it's spending the time to kind of like, okay, if we do this, if we do that. So he already had some really good ideas of how we can target it geographically, like the kind of profile of the owners that we're having the most success with, etc. We can geo-fence it. He already has processes that he knows how to do in terms of getting lists of owners to be able to send them mail. He can do, you know, Facebook retargeting and that sort of thing. So we were already kind of talking about some ideas. He's going to be put together a proposal of what a trial project might look like for us to try this in some of the markets where we're really struggling to get leads for clients. So, they'll probably need some work for all of you to kind of get them the information you need to be able, mostly onka, but you know, fire profile. follows, you know, targets, that sort of thing. Like, so if you just start thinking about who are the owners that we had and the best responses from, like, is there any assumptions that we can make around that around age or your business or qualities that you could potentially try to target in some way? But for example, he was saying, like, if we know how long they've been in business, then I can look at the LLC registration database and pull businesses that were registered before a certain amount of time in, like, a certain area and that sort of thing. yeah, that's exciting. Hopefully, he's not exorbitantly expensive or we can't afford him to work on this, but he's been wanting to, like, get involved with us in one way or another. So I think we'll find a way to work, we can trial this out, and if it works, then ideally we find a system that it's like, in addition to the mail and everything else that we do, that we also have these other channels to get us some good quality links.

[00:09:56]
Luke Gillespie: Awesome.

[00:10:00]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Yeah, cool. Um, so, uh, how are we looking? I have not been able to check in on Slack. So, how are we looking in terms of clients, uh, for halfway through the month so far? So, we'd love a kind of update. then I think Ryan, you had specific ones that you wanted to talk through, but we'd love just general overall update of where we're at with everybody, if you can.

[00:10:28]
Luke Gillespie: Okay. Uh, like a write-up list of how many write-ups we've got.

[00:10:33]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Yeah, how are we, how are we looking, having through the month?

[00:10:36]
Luke Gillespie: How are we feeling? Yeah, I have one write-up for Chris. Uh, a second one that's coming in the pipeline. I have what we have, the one off market for JB. have one right for AA that we haven't been able to submit yet because she's been, uh, dosing this. I'm sorry, I'm getting a HubSpot call when we turn this off. Turn my HubSpot phone off. Okay, so yeah, the one AA, then we have one BH that I finished yesterday, and we had, we have two for Gil, we already did the off market that Ryan presented, and I just did one today. So that's what we're at with write-ups. And we have things pipeline, for the most part, for most of the clients. I'm a little bit dry on JB and JJ right now. And AA, I haven't looked at much recently, but I have spent a lot of the last two days on a few broker calls and doing write-ups.

[00:11:37]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Okay, who hasn't received a write-up yet, this month?

[00:11:40]
Luke Gillespie: JJ, P, A, H, JSN.

[00:11:48]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Who was the last one?

[00:11:50]
Luke Gillespie: JSN.

[00:11:51]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Oh, Jason, Yeah, sorry. Okay, that's a lot. So what are we doing on those four?

[00:12:00]
Luke Gillespie: Yes, SP, I have two in the works that I'm working on. One, Ryan and I are going to look at tomorrow with the internet company, Ryan and I want to review it together. For AH, I also have two in the works with this, they're both with the same brokerage, I believe. And I was on the phone with the guy yesterday to come with things up about who we are and what we're doing. And so now, because we were contacting like the CEO, founder of the brokerage, but we were supposed to be contacting this other guy, Jeff, that I spoke to. I'm going be reaching out to him to talk about those deals. And then I have two deals for Jason as well. And like I said, JB already got one, but the only other one that didn't get the write up was JJ and I don't have anything hot right now.

[00:12:48]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Hey, so what do we do in on JJ then?

[00:12:50]
Luke Gillespie: Yes, we got a couple CIMs for JJ today, I believe. Yeah, got two CIMs here to review.

[00:13:00]
AcquiMatch Team: We'll open up our geographic location. We've got a couple of CIMs. We sent them back today. know, share that today. So checking the local data, just check those out and see if there could be a fit.

[00:13:15]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Are we being too tight on the criteria, like, or, well, first of all, go ahead. Yeah, go answer that question, Luke.

[00:13:30]
Luke Gillespie: I was going to say, no, I don't think so. And since JJ's deal has been so light, I'm being even more lenient. And, you know, like, if I'm closing somebody out for JJ at this point, it's because it was an automatic no go.

[00:13:42]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Okay, so we have two CIMs that are potentials for her. Do you have an indication of, like, how likely those are to be a write up?

[00:13:54]
Luke Gillespie: Good luck. This one caught my eye, it's established manufacturer of retail wood products, remember how much she loves wood from her own boarding poles, and it's in Cleveland.

[00:14:20]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): So we haven't looked at them yet, is what I'm gathering?

[00:14:24]
Luke Gillespie: I know, that's what I said earlier, they just came in today, and I haven't gone until yet.

[00:14:28]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Okay, and then Ryan, have you had a chance to catch up with her after our conversation?

[00:14:36]
AcquiMatch Team: Yes, she did say that now she is serious about buying a business, and she's open to putting in, putting together an offer for this business and moving forward. She was just concerned, just thought about spending time with her girls, but I kind of thought, okay, what could that look like, like a picture? other than that one guy doesn't need to be those months off or should it go away? could be probably like two weeks. I'm like, okay, well, I think there's a world where you can make an offer and if they say they want to go forward that offer, you can say, okay, in June, I'd like to take off two weeks to be spent that time with my girls. I think that's doable. think it just keeps moving forward with what you're looking at. She backed up and like, yeah, I want my wallet to continue. I gave you the feedback, I wrote down some points about your feedback about like, hey, two businesses. It's not easier than one and just because it's smaller, the dollar amount's less than not because it's less work. So it's something to think about and also they didn't recommend starting with the idea by too small to get to where you want to go, start off with your ideal business. But if we've identified that and this one is, we should go for Steve Adventeness. that's what we're currently seeing.

[00:15:57]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Awesome. Nice work on that. So she's back on board. For bigger businesses, she's okay.

[00:16:04]
AcquiMatch Team: Yes.

[00:16:05]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): And do we know if the roofing business is still available?

[00:16:09]
AcquiMatch Team: She checked. He has not checked. She was not checked, but she got asked as she sent to them was, I'm going to be cutting it out. Oh, why? Oh, and I still kind of want to discuss this with you. What we looked at today. And then once I kind of, I feel good about, okay, she's going forward with this, then submit a message like, hey, just check again. Mainly because I kind of don't, she's kind of going a little bit green on this already to them. I don't know. It's worth us like just sending messages. Hey, we're still checking in and we're gonna send an LOI. She's kind of done that a couple of times like look, Map on an LOI looks like good and then student message like yep We're gonna be submitting just want to check and make sure it's still available Gotcha.

[00:17:14]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Okay, so under Normal circumstances if it was like a Joe or someone I'd be like check first before going through all this work, but Seems like it's a good Process for her to go through anyway like even if this one isn't available. loves it So let's get it together and worst case they're like no It's already under offer and be like can you share anything about the feel so she can get an indication of like whether her deal was on track or not. So Um Yeah, sounds good. We'll want to get her looking at some other stuff soon too But i'm glad she's sorry my There's some weird tree pollen in the air here even though it's like freezing cold so You offing up the storm. So she, oh, I lost my train of thought.

[00:18:11]
AcquiMatch Team: So, so the idea of what you're talking about with Joe, like, yeah, no, she's the one like, we need to do this work anyway. And I wanted to, you know, I'd help start to analyze what this process is going to look like. And so this is where the work, right? I told her that I was like, well, honestly, on this first deal, you're getting like two to three meals for her experience. So I put her clients get because it is in a chat steel, and she has made it pretty least off. She's the broker called, seller called model. Hello, I, we didn't, we don't go on back. So now she's getting all this already. I don't know that she had a big smile. was like, okay, good.

[00:18:48]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): We'll get about that. Right. So yeah, I weighed a bigger up. That's awesome. Like, yeah, Jenny, like you're ahead of the class.

[00:18:55]
AcquiMatch Team: I love it. Yeah. So I think it's really just going through this stuff, getting her prepared to feel calm.

[00:19:05]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): So I'm assuming we're doing everything we can around the deal flow for JJ and HH or AH are the issues, right?

[00:19:28]
Anke Badenhorst: That's right. It works when I allowed the deal team to put a focus on a specific client, so we had them put a focus on JJ and then we had an influx of deals for JJ. So I'll have them put a focus on AH as well because that's the one that Luke mentioned this morning has low deal flow in terms of volume coming through.

[00:19:55]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Why do we need to tell them to put a focus? Why aren't they? Why aren't we getting them?

[00:20:00]
Anke Badenhorst: through anyway um no i think what what happens is um they have a scraping well i'm wondering if it was the focus or if it was the fact that we changed jj's deal parameters and then just a bulk of emails came and now it feels like a bunch of emails uh it feels like they changed their focus um because what they have is they have this big list and they are working through this whole list once a week it takes them a whole week to work through this whole list so um when i say focus on this person i think they just take the whole day and just work through that only person only that one client through the whole list just to give it a quick sweep sorry my eyes are burning um just to give it a quick sweep do they need to increase resource so that we're not waiting for them to

[00:21:00]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): on an entire week completing the list?

[00:21:02]
Anke Badenhorst: I did increase the resource. That's why I say it was they were taking longer and then I added another person to the team. That's why I needed to activate another contract so that they can do twice the amount in the same period. So and it's been working. mean, I'm seeing the numbers were at half the month and we've already done twice the amount of deals we normally do in a month. So we're over 2,000 deals already and we normally do about 1,000.

[00:21:39]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Yeah, we have a lot more plants right now though too.

[00:21:42]
Anke Badenhorst: Yeah, that is absolutely true. But I mean, we're only halfway through the month so I can see the amount of deals that we're is a lot more.

[00:21:50]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): OK, and then in terms of the studies stream throughout the process, so we're not creating bottlenecks, is that getting processed every day? And then it's... you're able to do everything every day or are we getting fit since it's still?

[00:22:04]
Luke Gillespie: Well, yeah, we're, oh, go ahead, I'll go.

[00:22:07]
Anke Badenhorst: No, no, this is yours.

[00:22:09]
Luke Gillespie: Yeah, no, yeah, we're doing it every day, but there are so many bulk RFIs put in from coming back from the holidays. I think, like, it is still catching up just doing, but it's spending so much over time doing RFIs.

[00:22:22]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Okay, but you're clearing the box every day. Okay, um, well, so we address that in terms of timing, so there's some predictability for Eda to be able to do her work.

[00:22:34]
Luke Gillespie: Yeah, yeah.

[00:22:38]
AcquiMatch Team: You did that back last week, then on one day that all those RFIs had kind of put like, oh, well, they're back and she was like, a little bit slower to do the, do her meals because of those RFIs. So that's what we had talked about last week was like, okay, we got to make sure that doesn't happen. And so we just want to make sure a lot of pace where it's like, she's doing RFIs or you're doing RFIs, she has the time to go in there, request the sense for those businesses, and get to all that. So we're back there from where we were last Monday.

[00:23:23]
Luke Gillespie: Not necessarily a new deal is piled up, it's just, there's so many, she's still just getting to it as much as she can, she's still doing off-market priorities and doing Ryan's, thanks for Ryan as well.

[00:23:37]
AcquiMatch Team: Okay, what she had said about last week was she was saying that normally her processes that, you know, RFIs come in, it's in a manageable amount where she can actually do the RFIs, and then she still has the time allocated to which she can actually reach out to the brokers immediately. Question. to say with what the deal for the last week, she wasn't able to do that. So what I'm asking her to get her, think what Athena's referencing to is, does she have time right now where she's actually doing the RFIs and then following her process of following up with the brokers that they can show against since immediately? you know that?

[00:24:18]
Luke Gillespie: So she's definitely doing that for some deals that are labeled as high priority, but I don't believe there's a small number of deals that she's doing that on every single one.

[00:24:28]
AcquiMatch Team: Okay, all with the note, Athena, to just go into that with either tomorrow or call.

[00:24:34]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Great. Yeah. in your all saying, like, Luke, time at which you send those has an impact on Eda being able to do her workflow in a timely manner. So just making sure that y'all are calibrating on that. So and doing it every single day, like clearing it every single day. So it's a manageable amount for her rather than, like, when you're doing it in an unpredictable time of the day. or unpredictable amount, then it creates a bottleneck for her to be able to process and follow up on those deals. we want to try to do is just have that assembly line just constantly processing things, right? So y'all calibrating on the timings and how you're doing that together. So only Ryan and I had a chat about it last week, so y'all can follow up on that, but that's just a kind of update on that. So steady stream and making sure that we're processing things every day that we're going to get a steady stream of deals. What we want to try to avoid is the how this client is a panic now. Now this client is a panic. Now this client is a panic, right? Because then we're never going to like have that throughput of everybody getting the amount of deals that they should get in a timely manner.

[00:25:45]
Luke Gillespie: So I'm going to keep digging into those sorts of things with y'all and seeing where we can tinker and optimize in that regard. Sorry. Yep.

[00:25:53]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Sweet. Okay. Cool. So everybody will be getting opportunities by the looks of things um by our call on Thursday those four that haven't achieved write-ups. If we're not like looking like we're gonna get them a write-up by the end of the week then I want some solutions kind of on the call and like what we're gonna do to make sure that they're getting write-ups.

[00:26:25]
Luke Gillespie: Yep, all right.

[00:26:26]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Cool. What else did you want to chat through Ryan? know you had some specific deals you wanted to talk through.

[00:26:33]
AcquiMatch Team: Okay.

[00:26:41]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Oh, first of all, I'd really love to hear how it went with Gil because I know you presented him with his first deal or two. So since that was his first one, how did it go?

[00:26:50]
AcquiMatch Team: Well, great. My immediate feedback is Gil's gonna need some coaching in terms of overthinking. It seems like he's done a lot of research and so he has thought through a million ways that things go wrong and he is putting those things into the deal before even getting started. Literally why I was reading him the intro and I said we're not going to discuss the deal, we're just going to discuss them right up and understanding what to look for, where to find things. He was like what if I had a bad gut feeling on this and I was like you're way too early to have a bad gut feeling. We haven't even talked about the business yet. So he was like okay I was like stay completely away, bad gut feeling. I was like I need logic as to why this is going to be a good deal that's how we're going to learn. He's like okay so he didn't give me some feedback on the write-up and his feedback is just pretty much that he thinks the owner is too involved in business but I think he's just watched one too many acquired. on its episodes and he's relating to something he heard about at the time. He's like, I'm not doing this. So I'm going to send a track and email kind of easy concerns and say, hey, see, that was a business. This is a good business. We should push forward so you can get a good, make this a learning opportunity and identify your concerns through conversations with directly with this other person. So, anyways, the introduction was good. He does acknowledge on this little review that he thinks the business is good, but he has made concerns as he thinks of the owners to involve. And I'm going to tell why a lot of businesses don't really involve because they're not planning on selling or building it to sell. They're just running their business. Not that's all. So, I'll discuss that with them. But I...

[00:28:53]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): a lot of experience with optimization too. So just like we were talking about with Alex, I think it was like, you got to validate your assumption. skill set actually so like you know to be able to identify those sorts of things but yeah he's gonna get super nervous and find reasons to like move forward because I'm scary on the first couple so I don't think he's had any broker on their calls either so he might need some extra hand holding there maybe it's worth if he hasn't already like pointing him to those buyers club calls where we talk through you know the owner meetings and like what that looks like and that sort of thing but um yeah okay great that sounds good I was gonna say something on him and now I can't remember anyway carry on we'd like to know any other customer to talk about any other guys before we talk about JJ is there anyone that you're feeling is not in a good place right now

[00:31:01]
AcquiMatch Team: Hey H is my main concern, he, the conversations at Slack, but you can see he's poking us for a deal flow. He's like, is there anything I can do to help him increase, right? This is the point where I'm making her current shows to him, with no deal on the table just to see if it keeps Andrew in mind, if it's in case you come across something, Andrew asked me to do that. So he's itching for possibilities, like JJ, the deal flow is low, you know, she's still kind of in this place where she's not exactly sure what she wanted and we have to talk through that. We're working on this modeling and she likes the business and she's excited that we are going to work on putting together now a lot, so she's like an exciting place, she's in the place where she's like, but Andrew I think is sitting on the stands right now. He wants to keep working. a little bit concerned about that.

[00:32:01]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): That's when's last time we had a conversation about expanding the geography?

[00:32:09]
AcquiMatch Team: Was probably when Luke submitted the last write-up I did a call with him about business and he was like yeah I don't I guess kind of the way I don't think I think it's gonna be too involved to be down there um and he just kind of fed back like he really I don't want it to be in a clothes like I don't think that when I think about moving I don't think about my my my my family's here um so this feedback was like it really to be a way from Oklahoma it didn't seem like it looks like opening up to the idea lunch um we still have Dallas as an option for him of of a business being more so remote or being able to They with distance, but in terms of expanding not a lot around because he's kind of in the middle of the nowhere. It's kind of like Oklahoma and then straight down to Texas.

[00:33:16]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Are we getting off-market for him?

[00:33:20]
AcquiMatch Team: Yes. Luke did a call. Got me set up with an interview tomorrow with an HVAC owner. So I'm planning on firing. Oh, Miss, I'll let this guy make this get this get this guy.

[00:33:35]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Yeah. Okay. Uh, Anka.

[00:33:37]
AcquiMatch Team: else do we do in there?

[00:33:43]
Anke Badenhorst: For a h It's I'm not sure I mean looked at me and Luke took a look at the numbers Um, earlier and the deal for A.H. feels steady. I showed, I took a look at the numbers and he has more deals than some of the other clients, but I think it's more situational for quality coming through, but I do see a few deals in the pipeline.
ACTION ITEM: Prioritize & review AH's 3 high-priority Dallas deals tmrw. Consider relocation/operator potential for non-absentee opps. - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/211578014?timestamp=2049.9999  Um, Luke.

[00:34:20]
Luke Gillespie: Yeah, I was going to talk about that working on him. It's, it's a location thing. his numbers might look like he needs a good amount of deals, but they're all Dallas Fort Worth deals and never really an absentee opportunity. Like I mentioned before, I have three, like, high priority businesses that I'm going to, I'll, I'll make him my number one priority tomorrow and push tomorrow. But again, they're all Dallas Fort Worth.

[00:34:53]
AcquiMatch Team: I would say that A.H. probably realizes that and that's why his last match is saying, is there anything we can new to like fine-tune the off-market search. And because I think he's on the on-market, so I think he's searching himself. He's just looking at it every day and he's realizing there's not much deal flow. And so that's why his message this week was like, hey, it's going on off-market. Luckily enough, I just responded immediately. I was like, I have a meeting on Wednesday with an HVAC for you. And so that's great. I said, I'll fall with you immediately to let you know how that conversation goes. But he was like, okay, anything we can do to like fine-tune the off-market so we can get more earth. And I said, well, we're going to keep it broad. has the best chance of finding potential opportunities for you. fine tuning it down doesn't make a lot of sense.

[00:35:49]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): What are we doing on off-market though? have we increased the leads? Are we getting responses?

[00:35:54]
Anke Badenhorst: What's happening there? All of the leads have been doubled. So, the off-market is far on all cylinders. I don't know about the responses, Luca, has you been coming through from Edo?

[00:36:14]
Luke Gillespie: For Oklahoma, all I've had, that I can remember was that HVAC one, yeah, I got quite a minutes. I think Andrew's kind of like the same situation Jimmy was in, right? Like the location, just nothing really works in Oklahoma, and then we had to talk to Jimmy to change things. And I feel like most of the businesses we give to Andrew are always Dallas Fort Worth because we really find things in Oklahoma.

[00:36:51]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): And you all with Edo tomorrow, dig in. to off market and really give that a good look and see what's what's what's not working. So if we're doubling the leads we should be getting more off market leads with a new process that you're putting in place so like something's not working, right? What is that? Or do we maybe need to like get a hit list for Luke where he just starts calling business owners to try to, you know, there are like some direct hits that like these would be ideal for Andrew.
ACTION ITEM: Call Andrew re: expanding geo constraints. Explain doubled leads, new Dallas lens (relocation/operator potential), growth marketing plans. - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/211578014?timestamp=2240.9999  Can we all map and see? But additionally Ryan, I think it's time to have another conversation with him like hey, the team is actually putting more effort into your search than we do for other clients. Like your geographic constraints are the most challenging of any clients that we have. Can we open it up to Dallas again to start looking at opportunities there because we might be missing something that you would love or that has an opportunity to be relocated. or to put an operator in place, but we're trying not to look at Dallas because of what you told us. So the thing you can do is open up geography so that you can at least look at more on-market opportunities and see if there's things that come through, because we did have that HVAC business that LK were looking at that was like distance. That came back on market too. Is that worth looking at again?

[00:38:33]
AcquiMatch Team: I think when it came back, think it was like making less than 100k or something or not.

[00:38:41]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): was really low. But also that off-market exterior painting company where the dude was running it from Oklahoma or something. Do you remember that?

[00:38:56]
AcquiMatch Team: The one I was telling you, exterior painting company.

[00:39:00]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Oh, yeah, he decided to stop yeah, but my viewers checking back in with him and seeing that But we know that things like those do exist there, so but if we're not looking at Dallas deals at all We're never gonna find anything like that No, we are looking at Dallas deals for our market.

[00:39:21]
Anke Badenhorst: We are for on market.

[00:39:22]
AcquiMatch Team: We are Yeah, my feedback was mainly saying like The one way given him. He's still like he's not thrilled about it. That's the only thing he's like So expanding beyond that is like going further out geographically when he's already not kind of like Receptive to some of the ones we've seen in the high the hottest market in the area.

[00:39:42]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Okay, why are we sending him Dallas deals then?

[00:39:46]
AcquiMatch Team: No, we are we are I'm just saying like if we expanded further geographically it has to be further than Dallas and it'd be in a market that's like Probably not nearly as good like it may be so

[00:40:00]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Oh, so if we're Dallas, why aren't we? Why aren't we getting deals through for us?

[00:40:08]
AcquiMatch Team: There's just nothing absentee that could be potential absentee that looks finding.

[00:40:15]
Luke Gillespie: We are pushing things through from Dallas. Like I said, I have three high priorities. I'm going to work on tomorrow, but yeah, they're never absentee enough.

[00:40:30]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): And are we looking at things that are potentially relocatable or like could have an operator put in place, even if there's not one? Are we looking at it from that lens?

[00:40:45]
Luke Gillespie: I haven't been pushing thinking about that that hard note.

[00:40:53]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): So Lindsey and Kevin, when they opened up to San Antonio and we found them this media media agency, the owners were running it in San Antonio because they love their little neighborhood and they don't want to leave and they can wait the orders operate now that I've met them like they can't do remote work because they're just like they can't function that way. So Lindsey and Kevin were like, Oh, we spend a couple months there, get the team stabilized, turn it to a hybrid and eventually relocate the business to Austin. So we want to be looking at not only like if it's sending off Austin do we have a situation where the owner is doing everything aspects of that can be replaced or there's a number two that hasn't had the opportunity to step up and take the lead because the owner has been doing everything themselves.

[00:41:46]
Luke Gillespie: Yeah, I'll start looking at things like that from that perspective and include that and write ups to Andrew and ask for the questions detailed more detailed questions to the workers about potential number two.

[00:41:58]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Okay, so Then we just need to remind Andrew, hey, geographic constraints just means it takes longer. Teams throw in absolutely everything at this to get you deals. We're going to look at Dallas from a different lens. You know, we've been eliminating anything that's not absentee, but we're going to look at things and see if maybe there is a potential to relocate and or put an operator in place to try to expand it a little How do you feel about that? What do you think? Do you think you'll go for that?

[00:42:38]
AcquiMatch Team: He's very open to having this discussion. It's definitely better to have started off taking it off and just have that conversation.

[00:42:48]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): And then I think you can also say, like, you know, we knew that geographic constraints was going to be a problem, right? So, like, it's not that it's not going to happen. It just takes longer. seems literally doing everything they can to find you opportunities. And I think this is working with a growth marketing consultant, and we're going to try even new tactics in your area to try to see if we can generate some leads other ways. But that might be a couple weeks before we get something taken from that. But just to assure him we're putting more into his search than we do for other clients. he has the probably like most difficult geographic constraints. But here's what we're going to do. We've doubled the amount of businesses that we contact. We're going to look at businesses in Dallas and look at them for these kinds of criteria. Would you be open to that? Like if we were to find something that maybe it would take you six months to go there, stabilize it, relocate it, and or you know advance the number two or put an operator in place for you to I have to be there all the time. That will definitely give us an opportunity is there to. There's an element of managing their expectations that it's just difficult with the geographic constraints and we've kind of been telling them all along. So it's like it's not, it's not that it's not going to happen. It just takes longer. Um, teams doing everything we can. Here's some ideas we have. Also in like one or two months, we might have a growth marketing person to be able to like target, you know, things differently, which will maybe might generate some more leads. So, you know, we're looking at absolutely everything we can to go outside of the box to find your stuff.

[00:44:49]
AcquiMatch Team: Yeah, I think that will be a good thing, like, you know, even just having more of our market conversations will just make them you're going to be like, that's so cool and these, these increase.
ACTION ITEM: Team mtg w/ Edah tmrw - Review AH's off-market pipeline. ID bottlenecks in doubled lead process. - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/211578014?timestamp=2700.9999  happening because they know that's not going to happen without us, right? So the idea of this while you're thinking of the soft market is I think it's good.

[00:45:09]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Yeah, and let's try to get them an off market. Like I love that you're going to throw everything and like get the HVAC owner in front of Andrew and that'll buy us some time. And then y'all as a team tomorrow with Edah, like look at his pipeline specifically for off market and see if you can spot what's not working because if we're doubling the leads, then we should be getting more opportunities come through.

[00:45:31]
Anke Badenhorst: Something's not working at some point. Yeah.

[00:45:38]
AcquiMatch Team: Okay, I got five minutes here.

[00:45:41]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Yeah, where is it?

[00:45:42]
AcquiMatch Team: Let me throw right here in the chat. This is the model and if anyone's just a discussion here, you jump into that that Google sheet. put a slide back right now for you.

[00:45:56]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): don't have access, Ryan.

[00:45:58]
Luke Gillespie: It's in.

[00:46:08]
AcquiMatch Team: Okay, should be good now.

[00:46:12]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Got it.

[00:46:14]
AcquiMatch Team: Okay, if you go to the pro forma, you know, what deal is this, sorry, so I can wrap my head around it. This is the Amco, this is the roofing business.

[00:46:27]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): For what client?

[00:46:29]
AcquiMatch Team: Okay. So if you're looking at column E and scroll to the adjusted, you'll see it's 1.1 million. Now this is the deal, Jen actually discussed this in one of the buyer's clubs, there's a lot of work that's going to be need to be replaced here. It's two owners and Jenny kind of broke up the amount of work that they're doing and kind of estimated what salaries would be to hire or. So, currently one of the owners is doing a ton of the sales work, so she put in there $120,000 to hire someone to do sales at the base salary post commission.

[00:47:12]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Seriously? Wow, that's a high base, huh?

[00:47:19]
AcquiMatch Team: Yeah, I think she's being aggressive there, but just keep going, we can come back to that. Operations lead promotion, so there's a current guy that could kind of take over one of the owners. We're also leading, so JJ replaces one, and then they promote one of the guys and operations to be kind of a manager, and she's a $50,000 increase for him. I also think that's an aggressive increase in salaries, so it's only $50,000, but I let her know that. Okay, she's guy, I do want to be a little bit conservative, like, okay, that's fine. So, just so you understand that, so then I want to be on her soft. Just doing he's doing the bookkeeping as well. So this owner, he's doing like 50 hours a week, and he's been doing this for a long time, right? So you can imagine if they actually want to move around and replace this work, it's going to take like hiring some people interested. She's been thinking this through. So $50,000 to hire like a bookkeeper full-time bookkeeper, and then $50,000 to replace the operations late. So the operations person who's going to take over that owner role, he's going to get an extra 50k, and then replacing that role, she's estimating 50k, right? These are some rough calculations she did to kind of get to a SDE there for 23,925,000. So that brings down the listed EBITDA from 1.1 to 925,000, but these assumptions also hire us that she would need to make. And so that gets the... look at the financial model, you can see her number, I think she changed. She put it 3.5, it was 3.8, we talked. I think she just changed that. But that was at 3.8 when we talked. Their listing price is currently 4.5.

[00:49:16]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): And she also is using an old version that's calculating the multiple based on the pro forma rather than the adjusted EBITDA.
ACTION ITEM: Update JJ's roofing biz model - Fix EBITDA calc, verify $291k working capital, review detailed financials. Research realistic salary assumptions (sales, ops promotion, bookkeeper). If still avail, recommend William Barlow LOI review ($500). - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/211578014?timestamp=2957.9999

[00:49:28]
AcquiMatch Team: Okay. I'll get her to use an updated model. How did you notice that just because you the C.

[00:49:37]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Yeah, so if you click on this one, it's divided by C14, C14 is here, but that's the adjusted EBITDA. So the newer one has the multiple of purchase price divided by adjusted EBITDA because that's how businesses are valued, right? So all of these adjustments aren't necessary to like it's necessary for cash flow projections, but not. for the um multiple.

[00:50:05]
AcquiMatch Team: Okay, is the only thing just like off and that this the multiple or is there something often here that's going to mess up the calculation?

[00:50:14]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Uh, yeah, so like it's going to be a much lower multiple at one point. Let me show you. So she doesn't look like a rookie when she goes in there and she's she's doing, you know, multiple based on that. So a three multiple is kind of low when we're looking at um a business that's doing a million in EBITDA or a So anyways, carry on with your thoughts here.

[00:50:58]
AcquiMatch Team: Um, so I'm ready. thing is that they're listed for $4.5 million, and she's trying to make an offer that works for her, and that's going to replacing a lot of this work that she's going to need to replace these owners. So she said, like, if I get down to, like, if I get to, like, number of, like, 3.8, something like that, you know, is that one, is she kind of thinking about this correctly in terms of where she had to go salaries that need to be replaced? I think it looks good. And then she's like, you know, is this coming in way too low? If so, you know, how do I kind of convey, you know, why I'm coming in much lower? personal feedback is that the 4.5 has just, they've been listed for over year, just listed at $4.5 million. just think that's just a pasted number. think that's a starting point. I don't think they're actually, or just dead set on that number. And if they're going to consider an individual or operator, which she is, then they're going to know there's going to be work that needs to be replaced. So they should be expecting an offer similar to this coming from an owner operator. I'm not, I think it's a good starting point if they're really interested in considering someone like her, it's at least a good enough starting point for them to write some things up and maybe send a camera off.

[00:52:24]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Right, and we know working capital is only $291,000 as she wrote there.

[00:52:30]
AcquiMatch Team: That was, yes, that's an estimated $291,000.

[00:52:34]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): They don't see it exceeding the number. So they get paid in cash when they start the job?

[00:52:42]
AcquiMatch Team: I can't remember on that.

[00:52:45]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): That seems really low for a $3.5 million business that's doing roofing jobs.

[00:52:53]
AcquiMatch Team: Yeah, it's almost all commercial, so maybe that has something to do with it.

[00:52:56]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Even more, commercial want payment terms, right?

[00:53:00]
AcquiMatch Team: So, like, what are the, yeah, so let's verify that she doesn't get caught out.

[00:53:05]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Do not let her agree to a specific amount in working capital in the LOI. It needs to be net working capital, which is estimated to be, which is estimated by the broker to be X, but it's going to be tied up in due diligence. I would also, for her, have William Barlow look over the LOI she's invented. Okay, for her specifically, right, because she's, like, especially with the working capital considerations and stuff like that, just to give her an extra vote of confidence as she goes through it's 500 bucks, but make sure that it's available first before she goes through that process. Okay, but that working capital seems really low for a $3 million business.

[00:54:12]
AcquiMatch Team: I got it.

[00:54:14]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Okay, cool. And. No depreciation, huh? There's no capital expenditure in the business.

[00:54:33]
AcquiMatch Team: We asked about that and I was turning it to financials and she got it after the fact. So we used to have the same with the online financials, but she's since got the detailed financials. I'm to ask her to send them so I have that email. So part of the call said, I'm going to review the financials and just make sure she did everything correctly and then follow up with it.

[00:54:54]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Those that assumptions that she's made are like wild. Like she's bookkeeper. just like making sure the B&L works or, you know, chasing some invoices or whatever. Also like sales base for roofing sales, like. No way, she she's bringing corporate numbers into this. So like I can't imagine and she can look at comps and figure out what what roofing sales people make. But I think it's probably more like a 50 60 base and then they get they get commission on sales.

[00:56:31]
AcquiMatch Team: Okay.

[00:56:32]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): And then she their their their incentives are aligned, right? So she can like boost the commission comp. If she wants to incentivize somebody giving someone a $50,000 raise though, like in the roofing industry.

[00:56:48]
AcquiMatch Team: Yeah.

[00:56:49]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Okay. Are we talking about two different people? She wants to give them a $50,000 raise.

[00:56:53]
AcquiMatch Team: They're salaries in the first place. Yeah. I'll revisit those numbers. Go. said, to give that information to her, everything just said in one place. Look at going to Barlow Williams after that because he has a concrete yellow eye place and then we'll go.

[00:57:10]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Yeah, because I want her to, especially if they've gotten wind that she's like not, like, and this is her first time and we need to make sure that she's like not putting yourself in weird situations. And I would say like, after you've gone through it, she's happy with it, then check if it's still available. If it is, you know, be like, hey, this might be worth you having Barlow Williams look at it for you before you submit it. And that can be credited against using them on the deal. And then, and then go from there. So that sounds good. But I like that you're working through this with her given her some homework.

[00:57:48]
AcquiMatch Team: Yeah, it's a good one. That's a good first one. Hopefully we get somewhere beyond just the first submission of an LOI. think we should get the step two of that. But okay, I got to run. They're going to close the doors on me. I will. See you guys later Awesome.

[00:58:03]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): y'all. Have a good night.

[00:58:05]
Luke Gillespie: You too.

[00:58:06]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Bye. Bye
