[14:15]
Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): But like, I really wish that like the digital nomad thing would have been a thing when I was younger, you know? Yeah. Well, I mean, you can with this job, like everybody, everybody, everybody else is like remote, right? So that's one of the cool things is like, I've been able to do this business fully remote and everybody else is too.

[14:34]
Austin Lortie: So. Wow. Yeah. I'm so thrilled to be here. My wife was like, how was your day yesterday?

[14:38]
Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): I'm like, that was great.

[14:42]
Austin Lortie: I'm like, I just like, it's important. like, obviously had a lot of job offers on the table when we were talking and I'm like, I think it's important to just like do things that like you enjoy doing and you like you really love and like that tends to come through and like the income will come, you know, it's like, it's a nice part about like doing sales is like. The variable component usually outpaces your base anyway, so it's like, yeah, I'm like, the moral of that story is I'm really, really happy with the decision I made, so.

[15:12]
Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): We're happy to have you, too. A little bit scared, but like, in a good way.

[15:17]
Austin Lortie: 100%, me and you both. I'm like, I'm just like, don't let the fear run your life and just like, be really confident in what you're doing, and confidence solves a lot of problems, so. I am bullish on where we're going.

[15:32]
Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): I'm like, see. Oh, you just muted. I don't know what happened there.

[15:38]
Austin Lortie: Sorry, I was just trying to move this. I was saying SBA changes the week that I got hired, you know, like, that's always fun, but.

[15:46]
Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): I actually like, so on my list for you today was to talk through the pricing model, just show you really quickly how I prepped with the intro call, I'll run the intro call again if you want, talk through what the follow-up looks like. I'll And then I have a couple opportunities coming into my inbox and just talking through like how to pass those over. Was there anything else you wanted to get through today?

[16:09]
Austin Lortie: The intro script, think I'm so like top portion, I think you'll be pleasantly surprised with how quick I caught on to that. So we should do that component down to the bottom of the questions. And then I just need to brush up on the elevator pitch a little bit.
ACTION ITEM: Practice exploratory call script 1-2 more times before next call - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/287299765?timestamp=991.9999
And then I ran through your exploratory call three times yesterday. And that is a bear for sure. But it's more fluid than it was at the beginning of yesterday. So I think if I run through that like four or five more times, I should be okay. But I'm just like sitting in my office talking to myself because I think that just given the volume that we're going to see and like the expectations and really like what we're hoping to accomplish.

[16:55]
Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): I I just felt like that was where my time. Oh, you just made it again.

[17:01]
Austin Lortie: I was just saying, I feel like that's where my time was best spent yesterday, as opposed to picking up the phone and booking meetings for next week, which I don't foresee that being terribly difficult or reaching out via email. So I just was like, hey, I want to be ultra, ultra prepared. So when we hop into these calls, it's a seamless transition and you don't have anxiety about handing over the reins to somebody else. So maybe last one, Athena, is like, I'm working Saturday at that event and then doing a, um, a, that event on Thursday night, which is probably going to end up being like a seven to probably 10 sort of work schedule.

[18:04]
Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): Was it? Was it Friday or Saturday that event? I thought it was Friday for some reason.

[18:09]
Austin Lortie: No, it's Saturday. It's Saturday.

[18:11]
Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): Oh, okay. Yeah. I'm it's fine.

[18:14]
Austin Lortie: I'm like, I don't have a problem. And normally, Athena, like, I'm not asking you for, like, I know last week was like a bit of an edge case because we had some folks in town and then this week's, or today's my anniversary. But, like, normally, like, you have me, like, 10 to 12 hours a day and, like, I'm locked in.

[18:29]
Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): So I'm not questioning whether you're more motivated to get it done than I am. I'm like, I don't care if it sounds as messy. Like, ah, you're like, I am.

[18:40]
Austin Lortie: I'm like, great. Not in the business of earning money, Athena.

[18:46]
Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): No, I mean, because I got the, you know, the SBA money, I'm, like, less in a, like, panic mode about sales. And, like, I'm trying to build right now, you know, and, like, lay a good foundation. So it's. Less of pressure for me, but obviously you want to make money and do all the things, so that's good. But I think it's a good, you know, it gives you, like, you're putting pressure on yourself, which is awesome, but it's less, like, these first calls and everything like that as you're learning it.

[19:23]
Austin Lortie: Like, there's less pressure for me that you need to, like, nail it.

[19:26]
Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): I am already, based on the call yesterday, I'm like, you're going to do great. So then it's just a matter of, like, learning, I think, the nuance of the objections and how, like, to position us and what our product is. So on that note, the pricing model that I sent over to SBA, what were your thoughts on that?

[19:48]
Austin Lortie: So SBA, so here's my thought, like, and this is just, like, quick top line math, is, like, if I do 70,000 divided by 6, we're charging, like, 12 grand a month. So that's, and I don't know, I'm like, I just don't know, right? It's like, you've had more conversations with prospects than I do. So like, I just don't know how that will be received necessarily, versus like, when you look at 70k over a 12 month timeline, you're six grand, right?

[20:17]
Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): Yeah, here's my issue, though. And so the six months free is basically like, you're bought in for 12 months, you know, and that's what I'm thinking there. But the way that SOP is written, we need to demonstrate the work done, and we need to attach it to hours and workload. So if our contract says 12 months, and they, for whatever reason, close in nine months, then they will probably want us to credit the three months against the final fee.

[20:47]
Austin Lortie: On the SBA side, not on the client side. That's what I didn't understand from that little blurb there. So yeah, that's, if that's what you're thinking, like, I'm totally fine on that side. like, we just temp check it. It's like, we'll get feedback from the market in real time. And if they don't like it, we can have that conversation. But yeah, I think that's totally fine on my side. If you're confident, I'm confident.

[21:13]
Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): Well, like the way I'm seeing it is it's a 12 month package. It's just front loaded. And then so they're like, you know, this is this is the amount to get it done, you know, so it's not about an amount of time like we've never done, you know, charge by the hour or anything like that. It's like, you want a business, this is the cost, you know, this is going to cover for six months of search, plus six months free, we have to structure it this way for SOP guideline reasons. But you know, you're you're getting 12 months of service. And then if, if you sign a purchase agreement, then then our success fee is, you know, the 30k.

[21:54]
Austin Lortie: Is that going to be our, I'm sure it's going to be articulated in our agreement, because my follow up question to that is like, do I have to position it that way to clients.

[22:02]
Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): Which way?

[22:04]
Austin Lortie: Six months up for, or this covers your first six months of service, and then the next six months are complimentary. Like the other way.

[22:11]
Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): up to, so I would say like, so the total package for your onboarding, which can take one to two months plus six months of, so it's like eight months, right, of work for $70,000.

[22:25]
Austin Lortie: Oh, two months of onboarding, and then the six months of search. Yeah, that alleviates it a little bit, because then you're sub $10,000 a month, and I think that's 100% reasonable. Beautiful, love it, no more concern.

[22:37]
Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): And then just like, I've been tracking the cost per write-up of like, it's not COGS, but like total cost to the business, and it's about $3,000 per write-up, right? So it's like between $6,000 and $12,000 a month to deliver the write-ups right now. So like, it's not, obviously. I'm optimizing that, but in terms of, like, you getting, like, comfortable with, like, we're not charging anything exorbitant in terms of, like, margin on this. So that's, it's a white glove concierge service. If you were good to go to, like, you know, a top-end, like, search service for private equity or, you know, M&A consultants and that sort of thing, they're charging, like, yeah, six figures a month.

[23:28]
Austin Lortie: I'm, like, it's 50 up front. I'm, like, I just, on the sell side anyways, I know it's, like, typically, like, if you go to a Deloitte or any of the big four, right, it's, like, 50 grand up front and then 10K a month and you get the junior team. That's typically what that looks like, you know.

[23:46]
Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): That's lower than I would have expected.

[23:48]
Austin Lortie: My gosh. Yeah, I'm, like, which is still, I'm, like, it's not insane, you know, and that's, like, probably lower middle market opportunities, right? So we're not talking, like, large, large deals, but, like, typically it's, like, 50. 50k up front and then 10k a month, and then you're getting a junior associate on the deal and not their managing directors actually managing that process. Right.

[24:10]
Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): Is there a success fee also?

[24:12]
Austin Lortie: Yeah, there's 5% on the back end.

[24:16]
Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): Yeah, there we go. So I think you can just like to educate because they're like, that's expensive. Like, that's where I would pull in that example, right?

[24:28]
Austin Lortie: Well, yeah, you know, like, exactly.

[24:33]
Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): So you're getting, you're getting basically 14 months of work, you know, we're, we're, we're motivated to get it done in six months, right? Because it's better for us. We don't want to have, but we will give up to six months complimentary search after the six months. So that's why I would say I wouldn't say like six months free, I would say like, and we'll, you know, extend an additional like up to an additional six It's not some complimentary search while you. Go through this process. Yeah, that's cool.

[25:04]
Austin Lortie: Yeah, thank you for asking me questions and making me come to that realization. That's always helpful. That's the best way to get buy-in for me. So, yeah, I'm like, I'm caught up. I'm happy. I think it's easy to explain that. You just need to change the slide on the last page of the deck.

[25:24]
Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): So how? Yeah, we'll have to, we can pull that up together and do that. But yeah, I think, you know, if they're like, what about just doing a success fee and be like, are you using SBA? Yes, no one's going to work with you because the maximum they can take out of the loan is 30K. And that's not enough to run a bespoke, geo-restricted search based on you, you know?

[25:56]
Austin Lortie: Yeah. No one's doing that for 30Gs. No. No. And the upfront cost doesn't bother me because it's just like, hey, guys, look, I've been around the block a time or two. I've worked with a few clients in terms of finding businesses or selling businesses. And I'll tell you right now, if you don't have skin in the game up front, when I come and ask you to do things or there's deliverables on your side, you're not nearly as motivated as if you actually have skin in the game. Like, there's a reason that we require that upfront, right? Like, that's more lenders.

[26:34]
Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): Oh, sorry.

[26:35]
Austin Lortie: I would say I was just gonna say, I'd say that more eloquently to a client, obviously. But that's like the posture that I would take if we're getting strong objections for upfront fees, you know?

[26:47]
Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): Right. Well, it's like, it's your startup cost, you know? Like, you want to start a business?

[26:52]
Austin Lortie: Are you going to do it for, like, no money? Or are you going to put money into getting your business off the ground? Right.

[26:57]
Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): Also, in addition to that, the... Like, when I was talking to Wendy from Live Oak, I was like, this SOP kind of  us a bit. She's like, I know I'm having to, like, renegotiate. Like, you know, everyone on the buy side is infected right now. She's got a couple of deals where there was, like, big buy side fees already banked into it. And now they're not going to be able to pay it, right? So she's like, I was like, look, we're going to be bringing in even more clients, more people I want to put in front of you. Like, let's find a way to make this work. And she's like, Athena, I can't tell you what a difference it makes that your people have already paid a big amount of money. Like, that they're serious, right? So the lenders also view these people as way more serious than she's like, I've had people from Cody's community, like, reach out to me. And she's like, I just, I haven't even responded to them, you know? Like, so it's interesting, too, the perception when, you know, this. Service providers and everybody's like, they've paid a lot of money. They've got skin in the game. They're serious. They're getting with the right people. So how is that going to be viewed on their end when they're having to go and get a loan? And I think another point that a lot of people don't realize is that most of the conversation that the SBA has about whether to approve a loan is about the buyer.

[28:27]
Austin Lortie: Characteristics, yeah—the five Cs of credit.

[28:31]
Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): Well, like, they're going to give someone millions of dollars, right? So it's like, is this person capable of running this business? Do we like them? Do we have confidence in them? Like, it's not just like mortgage approval. It's like, can this person run a business? So, you know, all of the lenders are like, they're evaluating you. They're judging you with every single interaction, and they're going to decide whether they think that you're putting forward. And giving millions of dollars to run a business when you've never done that before, you know? So, like.

[29:09]
Austin Lortie: I'm like, I've personally approached Wendy for, like, to pre-qual a loan for me. She's like, yeah, I'll do it if your mom co-signs. And I'm like, oh, I'm like, Wendy, help me out here. But she's like, it was a pleasure to work with. You know, like, she was really quick and responsive and, like, always wanted to take a call. But, like, I empathize on the other side of that. It's like something that, like, maybe you're not far enough along in your career where this makes sense yet, you know? And, like, you really need to be, like, articulate and very pointed in those conversations. And I went into it, like, haphazardly, you know? Or, like, if I had gone in a little bit more prepared, I think I would have seen better results with her specifically, you know? But, yeah, I'm like, I understand, like, the buyer side as well.

[29:54]
Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): Yeah, most, most, um... When I told her that 2% stat, she was like, oh my God, you're right. 2% of the people that contact her actually close on a loan. So her pipeline, she's like, I got to increase my pipeline. She was like, I think you're right. Holy . But that means that there's a bunch of people wasting her time. And there's a bunch of people that go to the lender and they're like, help me structure my deal. Or what do you think? Or can you do the due diligence? Like our buyers show up with some of the best financial models I've ever seen. Us behind them, you know, like a thought, like they already have a buyer profile, like everything. So we're also, they don't realize it's going to be a problem because they haven't tried to go for funding yet.

[30:47]
Austin Lortie: But if you haven't had to go to seven different lenders to get their first deal done. Your, uh, your due diligence checklist is worth 20 grand by itself. Like, in my opinion, you know, like, if you told me, like, yeah, I'm going to give you a checklist of everything you need to go through and due diligence and, like, exactly the order in which it's required, et cetera, like, I'd be like, yeah, that's worth $20,000 easy, in my opinion. Like, that's the hardest part of evaluating transactions.

[31:20]
Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): Yeah, they're, you know, they're getting a lot of value. So Acquira charges $65,000 up front and $150,000 overall. And from what I hear, they're delivering, like, one deal every other month because I had a guy, like, go through our sales process, two, actually, that had very bad experiences with them. And they really wanted to sign up with us, but they were just afraid to make another investment into something. I didn't get them over the line, but they both would have been fantastic. Clients that just acquire, I got them first, you know, so they're charging about that much.

[32:00]
Austin Lortie: Yeah, I'm like, I think it's fine. I'm like, the market will give us feedback, you know, like, and I, especially if you're not getting asked for payment plans at 30 grand, you know what I mean? Like, 50, you're probably still not getting asked for payment plans, 70, maybe. You know what I mean? It's like, okay, if we do 50 up front, structure the 20 over six months, like, that's agreeable. You know, I would guess on your side.

[32:28]
Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): And I would never say that one more time, 50 up front, and then 20 over three months, over six, over six. Yeah, we could do that.

[32:40]
Austin Lortie: The one I'm like, I never like making those decisions on a phone call. Anyways, it's like, I always position it's like, hey, like, that's a heavy lift. Like, we have a lot of work that is front loaded, right? Like, after we have the search running the background, like, yeah, we have to evaluate deals and deals in real time. But like a lot of our expenses are front loaded. In terms of onboarding and actually building out that infrastructure to do outreach, you know, I know a lot of that doesn't cost a ton of money, but like, they don't know that.

[33:09]
Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): I mean, it is a lot to go through all that. And we're going to start spending more money in different ways to get experiment. Once I've got the team like really optimized in the off market, we're literally about to like, they just cleared the last like temporary bottleneck in the on market process. So I'm so excited because like, I think Luke doubled his write up output this month.

[33:35]
Austin Lortie: Oh, that's incredible.

[33:37]
Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): Yeah, because like, I've been working with them on manufacturing principles, but it was like, through the team. So now that I am overseeing it, it's great. It's like, I'm super excited about how it's going to go. Oh, I think. Oh, I And then off-market, we're doing the same thing. So I'm back up in that and being very active and vocal in it. I'm like, not just vocal, but how are we actually doing this and making the most of this? Because we pay for those leads, right? We have a team that goes out and researches. They don't use AI. They go out and research business owners in that geo, in the industries that they're interested in. They find all their personal details so we can outreach to them. It is a lot of work, right? And every single one of those leads is a cost to us. So making the most of them and how we're getting them engaged. But this is where, once you're settled, I would love if you were open to review their scripts and just some of the language and how they're doing it. Because I think you, having been on the sales side, you'd probably have a lot of really great insight for them to make the most of that.

[34:51]
Austin Lortie: Because none of them are sales, right? I think. Yeah. And I'm like, I love email marketing. I'm like, it's... Say I'm a sales pro and a marketing connoisseur. I'm like, I love marketing. You just don't get paid nearly as well to be a marketer as you do in sales. And, like, sales is, like, it's more challenging and just, like, so, so much fun. I'm like, it's my favorite thing in the world. People that don't love sales don't stay in sales for very long because it's really freaking hard. And most people quit before they get any good. Yeah, I'm like, I love it. It's my, it's, it's my spirit animal.

[35:30]
Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): I'm like, I love sales. But it's awesome. I mean, I, I think if I was selling for someone else, like, now that I've, like, developed all these skills and stuff, I'd probably be a lot more effective. But, um.

[35:47]
Austin Lortie: You're a good salesperson, Athena. Like, I'm like, when I tell you you're better than 80% of the sales people I've hired, like, I mean that. I you're, I'm like, the things that you could work on is, like, objection handling in the clothes. I'm like, that's it. I'm proud I'm Thank And like, all of that's like, pretty easy to teach, you know, it's like, more high level business acumen asking good questions to get good data that then you're able to use at the end of that call, which you're like, really, really, you're probably better at that than I am, to be honest.

[36:19]
Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): Thank you. Yeah, I, the GPT, like, summary, don't know if Anika's showed you, like, that's been really helpful. Now that we've got it in place, because I used to just like, recap all their like, okay, you want a business this much, blah, blah. And I started doing these like summaries to them. And they're like, and it's like touching into the pain points, the emotion, everything. And they're like, wow. Yeah, you really nailed that. This better way to kick off the call, right? Like, so I just cracked that recently. And that feels really good. But yeah, the objection handling, I just, I melt.

[37:00]
Austin Lortie: I hate it so much like I just there's an adage in sales is like sales starts the first time you hear no yeah right it's like and then like get understand and like you saw in my objection handling like it's like I'm not like offering rebuttals it's like questions to get them to reach the same conclusion that I want to tell them and that's all like very nuanced and just comes with time, you know, and like I'm sure like that script's gonna change over the next 90 days you know what I mean but like that's a good starting point but like it's just so much fun it's so much fun.

[37:37]
Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): know I love I love that you love it like that was that was the thing that like absolutely stood out about you it's like um you know the text objections and the way that you like did the objection handling with me I was like you clearly are very good at it and are not bothered by it right like you stay calm like it's not like a getting on the defensive You don't show any sort of negative emotions around it. And that's exactly what I need to master if I'm going to keep doing sales. And I have to, in a way, right? I'll always be doing sales as a founder. And I know what good looks like, even though I haven't necessarily mastered it myself. So that's cool. So let me see. So I was going to ask you, on the exploration call, I had to kind of figure out this configuration on my screen so I could have the whole script open and show the PowerPoint. And I actually made it into a PowerPoint. So I didn't know if you, like, are you planning on reading the script? Would it be helpful for me to show you how I configured my screen?

[38:52]
Austin Lortie: Or do you know how to do all that? No, I have it set up so it pops up in a single window. And then I've got, like, laptop over here. Here's another monitor over here, and then this one in front of me, and then I just split the screen down the middle where the script's right in front of the camera. So can you tell that I'm reading right now? I'm Athena, founder of AcquiMatch. Our team helps first-time buyers find and acquire businesses. It looks like I'm looking at you still, I would assume.

[39:17]
Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): It actually looks like you're looking down a little bit. But I mean, it's fine.

[39:22]
Austin Lortie: I'm looking off to the right.

[39:24]
Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): So, you know, when I'm doing it, I have it split screen too. So I had it like, but I had to use PowerPoint instead of Canva to like get it to show. And then there's also that little video walkthrough too that I just have saved on my laptop. So I can share the whole presentation with you.

[39:48]
Austin Lortie: Oh, yeah. I just saved it. I uploaded it to our Google Drive and then uploaded it as a PowerPoint. And then I can have it like show full screen and then only share that specific window.

[40:00]
Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): Okay, and the formatting was okay because on a lot of the slides I had to change it to like JPEGs on it.

[40:06]
Austin Lortie: No, everything came through more or less. I'm here. I'll just share my screen and show you. Can I have a permission?

[40:15]
Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): There you go.
SCREEN SHARING: Austin started screen sharing - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/287299765?timestamp=2435.382026

[40:18]
Austin Lortie: Start from the beginning, hold on. Start the slideshow. Oh, nice. And then you go away. Yeah, I don't know how you feel about formatting here.

[40:52]
Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): Keep going. Take care. We'll be right Take You Okay, the font went funny on some of those. Oh, and then that video that you've got, is that the newer template?

[41:16]
Austin Lortie: I don't know. I was going to ask you about that.

[41:18]
Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): Oh, yeah, that's the one I meant with the video that I have saved on my laptop. So let me get you that so you can add that in. Keep going. Let me see the last slides. Yeah, see the font went all funny there. So let me go back.

[41:45]
Austin Lortie: Yeah, that's perfect.

[42:33]
Austin Lortie: No.

[42:36]
Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): Weird. Okay, let me share again. Share.

[42:42]
Austin Lortie: There you go.

[42:44]
Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): Okay, so it goes from, so see the font doesn't, like, hang down, so I think the font just didn't transfer over, but I'll send you this whole PowerPoint, because some of these are, I don't know what it Maybe it's just the font's off. My, . Can I save it with the fonts? We'll see.

[43:08]
Austin Lortie: I just don't have power, I run a Mac, so I don't have PowerPoint on this.

[43:14]
Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): So do you want, oh, you don't have PowerPoint?

[43:19]
Austin Lortie: Yeah, I'm like, have slides, so I just use Google usually. I want to reformat this on Google, it should be fine.

[43:26]
Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): Or what you can do is you can download from Canva, like, images, and then insert that into the slides so that the formatting stays the same.

[43:39]
Austin Lortie: Okay, yeah.

[43:42]
Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): I'm very pedantic about brand and fonts, just so you know, because I was at Guinness World Records for three and a half years, which is, like, IP brand, and most of my career is, like, brand management, marketing, that sort of thing. So, like, the fonts and just the brand and stuff is, like, I'm very I do get $100 to have it for the year, and I like Excel, too, Athena.

[44:07]
Austin Lortie: if anything, I'll just go get the web version.

[44:11]
Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): We can cover that, too, if you need it, if PowerPoint would be better for you. Just talk about what you need. So in terms of this part, do we leave it $100,000 per business and then just change this?

[44:28]
Austin Lortie: That's what I would do.

[44:29]
Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): Okay, so cost to get started, $70,000 advance, covers onboarding in the first six months, up to six months complimentary. Okay.

[45:00]
Austin Lortie: All right. All right. Thank Because we don't know if the $30,000 can come out of the loan yet, huh?

[45:06]
Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): We do.

[45:08]
Austin Lortie: It can.

[45:09]
Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): Yeah. What I'm more concerned about is whether this can be applied towards equity injection.

[45:15]
Austin Lortie: Yeah. Because that's a hefty fee on the front end.

[45:19]
Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): Yeah. So as long as it can apply towards their equity injection, towards their down payment, then I think it will be fine, right? Right?

[45:28]
Austin Lortie: So, and then they'll have to put the whole $100,000 into the loan for that to apply as equity injection. Cool. You, so in theory, Athena, like, you could build an additional $70,000 in working capital. It's just going to be, quote, unquote, working capital in the business, correct?

[45:49]
Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): No. So it would go in their sources and uses. Right? So, like, they would add, like, $100,000. And into the uses part for our service. And $70,000 of that was already paid. So that would apply towards their equity injection. And then the additional $30,000 would come back to us. So they have to put the whole $100,000 into the loan, which would then be amortized over the life of the loan.

[46:20]
Austin Lortie: That makes sense.

[46:21]
Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): That makes sense. Yeah. I mean, some banks might treat it as working capital, but if they treat it as working capital and they don't cover this as equity injection, then basically people are going to have to come up, like, this is just some cost and they're going to have to come up with, like, the additional money for their equity injection. So, for example, let's say that the loan is an overall total cost with everything is a million dollars.

[46:47]
Austin Lortie: They need to put $100,000 in.

[46:49]
Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): If the bank doesn't view it as equity injection, they're going to have to come up with $100,000. If they do view it as equity injection, they have to come up with $30,000.

[47:00]
Austin Lortie: That makes sense. So it's listed. And is that true for like QoE or attorney fees as well?

[47:08]
Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): Correct.

[47:09]
Austin Lortie: So if they ended up spending $100,000 in total, they could count that as their equity injection and just finance the balance. Makes sense.

[47:17]
Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): Yeah, because they've already put, they've paid money towards the deal, right? But they need to put the whole cost into the loan. So like the bank would be financing, you know, the whole thing to them. So like, then it means people are going to be paying interest on this money.

[47:38]
Austin Lortie: Yeah, that makes sense. That makes sense.

[47:40]
Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): Yeah. So yeah, does that make sense? The way I wrote that?

[47:52]
Austin Lortie: Yes. Covers onboarding in first six months of search up to six months complimentary. Up to six additional months, yeah that works too, if you just throw additional.

[48:09]
Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): Up to six months, to six additional months.

[48:25]
Austin Lortie: Yeah.

[48:30]
Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): Okay.

[48:32]
Austin Lortie: Additional, you can maybe leave out of search. If you have additional in there, because it's implied. No, you need to leave that additional, I'm sorry.

[48:45]
Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): Yeah, it's all good. Up to six additional complimentary months of search. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. How about that?

[49:02]
Austin Lortie: Sure. I'm not going to read that anyways.

[49:09]
Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): Okay, cool. There we go. Great. Okay, let me see if I can save this. And then the video, I'll just show you really quick what it looks like. So I kind of narrate this video with what they're seeing. Um, this is like the client dashboard. Um, have you seen me narrate this video before?

[49:37]
Austin Lortie: Yeah, and one of the one of your role plays.

[49:40]
Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): Okay. Um, and then this is the new, like, badass, uh, finance spreadsheet. So, there's, um, you can't see it at the bottom, but there's, like, so much firepower in this thing. They get to model out three different scenarios. They can do... They different models around multiples or purchase price. They can add in different variations. What's that?

[50:09]
Austin Lortie: So your 10-year pro forma, that's cool.

[50:12]
Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): And a three-year look back so they can see what the bank sees in terms of debt service coverage. It needs to be able to have covered it for the last three years also. There's a ton in here. They can add investor money.

[50:26]
Austin Lortie: They can add real estate.

[50:27]
Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): They can do different types of seller notes. All included for clients, and that's how we help them model. And then the DD Tracker, you've already seen that. So let me say you model a whole lot better than I can, Athena. I mean, I had to pay someone to do that. I was like, I know what I need it to do.

[50:53]
Austin Lortie: I have no idea how to create the formulas.

[50:56]
Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): But yeah, I mean, I paid a consultant like thousands of dollars.

[51:00]
Austin Lortie: To build that for us, you know? Yeah, that's sick.

[51:06]
Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): I thought you used to be able to save the font somehow in this.

[51:13]
Austin Lortie: Hold on, two seconds, I'm coming back.

[51:15]
Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): Okay. It doesn't work. We'll be right back. Bye-bye. Let me see if I can drop this in Slack for you.

[52:10]
Austin Lortie: Yeah, of course, an email, whatever you need to do.

[52:16]
Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): Slack is better because then Anika and Kate have access to it too.

[52:23]
Austin Lortie: Do you... I'm sucking, I haven't been using your tracker. Or doing your daily reports. I'm sorry.

[52:37]
Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): That's okay. When you start doing calls, I'd really like you to do that.

[52:41]
Austin Lortie: Yeah. But even just being aware of what I've been doing the past few days is probably helpful as well. So I'll call you there. But I've been productive, I promise.

[52:52]
Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): I believe it. Let me see. Let me see. Sorry. . Okay, drop in Slack.

[53:14]
Austin Lortie: Beautiful.

[53:21]
Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): Okay, so... We did that. Cool. I was going to show you just quickly how I prep for these intro calls. I'm not sure where Anika's training, like, crosses over or not. So has she gone through all the, like, texting up front and that sort of thing, like, in the lead-up to an intro call?

[53:48]
Austin Lortie: Yeah, we did that yesterday.

[53:53]
Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): Okay, great. So how I typically prepare. So we have this woman who saw me speak. And it looks like she is legitimately looking to buy a business. They invited the ETA club from McCombs also. So are you still comfortable leading the intro call?

[54:12]
Austin Lortie: Yeah, yeah, absolutely. Yeah, I'm good.

[54:14]
Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): Okay, great. So we'll just have to, like, you know, I guess, how would you normally explain me shadowing you doing it or me being there?

[54:23]
Austin Lortie: Like, what's the normal positioning or what are you thinking there? I'd just probably hop on and be like, hey, It sounds like you've already met Athena. Did a quick conversation over at McCombs. Yeah, my name's Austin.

[54:37]
Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): We didn't actually talk, so she just saw me speak. But we've been speaking over her text message, so I'll show you that.

[54:44]
Austin Lortie: But yeah. Yeah, yeah. And I already went through her text message, actually.

[54:48]
Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): Okay, great.

[54:49]
Austin Lortie: But I would probably just be like, hey, my name's Austin. I'm brand new here. Athena's in the process of expanding capacity. So we can help more phenomenal founders like yourself. So what we'll be doing today is walking through just some brief points around, and I'd probably go into your intro, and we'll be like, Athena's a bit of a fly on the wall today, just making sure I do my job right, but I'm sure she'll chime in with additional questions or context as needed, like something to that effect.

[55:18]
Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): Okay, sounds great. So let me show you just, I guess, not how I review these for process, but if there's anything that jumps out that I need to pull out in the conversation is typically what I'm looking for. So we start asking questions to see if we can get an understanding of the restrictions. Something that occurred to me this morning when was making coffee was, did I, in particular, landscaping business, that's hot in private equity right now, too. Right. So let me share my screen. I've got her record up.
SCREEN SHARING: Athena started screen sharing - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/287299765?timestamp=3361.818455

[57:10]
Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): Also, I need to get you in the EBIT WhatsApp group. Because quite a few leads have come through that. And I think it's good for you to be in there and in that conversation. Okay, so Morgan, first thing I do is just I go down and I see where they came from. So she's in Mike's entrepreneurship class. Supposedly, she has a good amount of money to invest. Doesn't look like anything else there. Then I just check if there was any emails. I mean, you're going to be communicating with them.

[57:58]
Austin Lortie: But for me, it's like Monica's doing... We were a lot of the upfront communication, but for the SMS, let's see what happened here. Oh, nice. You can click on the list and it'll pull it up. Go ahead.

[58:11]
Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): What's that?

[58:12]
Austin Lortie: I was just saying, I pulled it up in Sakari as opposed to HubSpot, her text thread, because I didn't realize you could just click in.

[58:19]
Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): So that's helpful to know. Yeah, yeah. You just click send SMS and it will pull up the whole conversation right there. It is a little bit easier to write them in Sakari sometimes, but so, okay, what kind of business do you want to buy? Home services. So this is good. If she said only landscaping, then I would dig into that on the call, because if they only want one industry, we can't do a one industry search. But home services is usually big enough to do it. Now, the other thing is, where is she looking? If she's only looking in Austin, we are not able to really take on more than one Austin-only client. So that's just FYI for you. In most other markets, it's big enough that we can do it. But Austin is like, in terms of available businesses for sale, it's just really tiny. And for some reason, all the searchers are in Austin, and they don't want to go more than 45 minutes out of Austin. So, like, if they say Austin, then be like, well, how far of a commute? And I really need them to be open from like Waco to San Antonio for us to be able to take them on, or they just need to wait until our other Austin client is done.

[59:31]
Austin Lortie: Are you open to landscaping only, but nationwide?

[59:40]
Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): We'd have to discuss with the team. So I've had that before where, like, but it kind of is weird for our model, you know, like, part of what we were doing is consultancy around, like, whether they're a fit for the business. So the team just hunting a specific industry.

[59:59]
Austin Lortie: Pool services in that lane. Like low overhead, high margin. So there's a few other things that we could picture on that as well.

[1:00:06]
Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): Well, home services can be like cleaning, it can be landscaping, power washing, like any, you know, so like I dig into that. But if it's like landscaping only, if they were open nationwide, maybe, but we'd have to have a team and they'll do like some looking into like what are the addressable market sizes for us. So they'll look at like, you know, past listings and that sort of thing. We know how many deals we need up front to be able to deliver the two to four a month. And if they're like, I just want this industry that I'm like, okay, go talk to somebody else. Right. That's where I'd potentially refer them to Andre because he likes people to be industry specific, but they need to be open geographically. But, you know, you can always be like, I, you know, I'm not sure. Let me have a conversation and we can talk about it and see how we feel. But just the Austin thing is really important. Like if people are like only Austin. Then like, A, you're looking for potentially, you know, a longer time because it is a very small market business wise. Right. And then it's super competitive. It's more competitive than anywhere else in the U.S. There's more searchers in Austin than anywhere else as far as I can work out. So if they're open from like, you know, Waco to San Antonio, that opens it up. If they would also be open, like Dallas is a huge market. So Dallas or Houston, if they add that in, then it's like, okay, we can start working with you. If they only want Austin, then they're just going to have to wait until our current Austin client is wrapped up.

[1:01:45]
Austin Lortie: Yeah, yeah.

[1:01:45]
Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): Makes sense. Cool. So cool. We shared Lindsay's video. Lindsay closed on a design and build landscaping business in Austin. So that's pretty cool. What's okay. What's the hardest part of finding a business to buy? Love to hear that. Most difficult part has been finding a viable business and getting face-to-face with a seller. So it sounds like she's not getting taken seriously, potentially, or not doing enough volume, or like, why aren't you getting face-to-face? Thanks for reaching out. Look forward to connecting on Tuesday. Have you had a chance to watch the video? Yes. Watch both of the videos. Great. Okay. So those videos, by the way, I'm kind of like, I'm super open to re-recording those or doing whatever content that you think would be helpful to educate them, like pre-calls. So we're using those right now, but it is something very easy for me. It's not a huge lift for me to, like, put together a new presentation and just record it and, like, have a new video. So this first one of programming the GPS is just, I'd actually love to re-record it and just, like, more of... Um, our thesis and the things that they need to think about potentially working with us, but like, you know, better the stages and like, what do they need coming into this? That's going to make them the best, like kind of intro meeting for you. What video do we want to send them? And like a lot of people don't even know that these services exist or we are, you know, when they, they just heard about us and they sign up and, and they're like, okay, I don't know what the market looks like for, you know, any, any, like buy side services or anything.

[1:03:33]
Austin Lortie: So. I like the, I like the, and that's like more of a promotion methodology. Correct. Athena, like doing videos and like making them, giving them homework, things of that nature. I've just never done that in a sales process, to be honest with you, like lightly, but like, usually it's like, like I'm the one handling the education process, but like walking into an initial call, would say like trust and know, right. It's like they building trust and credibility in who you are and what we do. And then like. Know in the market in terms of like social proof.

[1:04:02]
Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): Those would be like the two best things to have like walking into an intro call. Yeah. Well, I mean, it might be after the Acquiring Minds webinar that I do where I talk through how to work with a buy side advisor, what the different services are, like how we're different. That might be a better one for them to watch so they know when they get on the call, like what a buy side advisor is. But you can see how you feel about it.

[1:04:27]
Austin Lortie: Maybe it's after. I love that because it's not it's not content that we're putting out. It's content someone else is putting out. So it's like you already have kind of that social proof component baked into that. I really like that idea, Athena.

[1:04:44]
Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): So that will be done June 5th. And then also we'll have the Acquiring Minds pod with Lindsay and Kevin, who bought two businesses with us. That's coming out May 12th.

[1:04:55]
Austin Lortie: So that will be another piece of content that you can drip with people, which is like third party confirmation, right?

[1:05:00]
Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): They're the same testimonials that we have on the website, but I just explained it. We're White Glove Concierge. We started with a handful of clients, and we got all of them under LOI, but you know the reasons why some of them didn't move forward. And there's a lot. I think Gil's about to sign an LOI. I'm so excited. I think he might actually close on that business. I just hope due diligence doesn't come up with anything that's like, you know, a problem, but it seems like a really good fit for him. Okay, so...

[1:05:36]
Austin Lortie: Is that the mortgage one?

[1:05:40]
Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): No, he is probably going to walk away from that one, which is a shame. But, you know, he just couldn't get comfortable with it from a risk perspective, with it being Canadian, and like the seller was asking for a whole bunch of terms. So, I understand. You know, it would have been a really great story, but it is what it is. So typically, I mean, I don't know how consistently this is happening, but I like connecting with them on LinkedIn for the call so they can see, you know, me and I've been putting, like, that's the only place that I post content.
ACTION ITEM: Connect w/ Morgan on LinkedIn before intro call - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/287299765?timestamp=3982.9999
I've been putting a lot of, like, I think good content up there. So, you know, do what you will with that. Or if you want, like, if you still want me to connect with them, like, if that would be an extra boost or whatever, we can set it up and automate it.

[1:06:43]
Austin Lortie: My resume is not too terrible for this job. You know what I mean? Like, in terms of establishing credibility. So, yeah, great.

[1:06:50]
Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): No, I don't think that is just, you know, just, like, about what we do and stuff. So we'll just see what it was interesting. When I handed over the broker calls to, because I, when I started this business, I was doing all of the sourcing myself. And so the pitch that I had to make to brokers was very different for me than what the team ended up having to do. So there's going to be like a transition. So I guess what I'm saying is like, whatever you think you need to tee you up for success, I'm willing to create content or, you know, do whatever. Cool. So it doesn't look like there was any email back and forth, but, you know, I just always check also the, like where the lead came from, especially if it was like a personal referral so that I know to follow up with them if I need to. And we pay referral fees. So it's just really important that we keep this up to date. If they're like, oh, I heard about you from so-and-so, then I like to pay people for sending people our way because it's allowed us not to have to spend a lot of money on marketing. Last year and a half. So any questions on that? This is kind of a light one.

[1:08:07]
Austin Lortie: No, no, that makes sense. And I'm like obsessed with data hygiene as well in terms of like making sure that like all of that's accurate and up to date. So if there's like any other specific things that you want to like point out to me that is, do you play with closed dates at all, Athena?

[1:08:26]
Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): No, you're more than welcome to do that. Also, the amounts, haven't been great at like keeping those up to date. We can automate it. So any automations that you need to have spot to a lot of this is automated. So like Anika can can set that up for you if if you need anything like to automatically put the amount in or that sort of thing.

[1:08:48]
Austin Lortie: Cool.

[1:08:49]
Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): Let me see. And if you want this stuff cleaned up, because you're going to be the one working in this the most, so like if you want these. Changed and whatever, like, I'm totally fine with that.

[1:09:03]
Austin Lortie: I think you can just drag them around, too, for the most part.

[1:09:06]
Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): Yeah, but, like, these things, like, if you want them, like, changed or the orientation and stuff. And then we'll have to go through the quotes at some point so I can show you how to make those. And then just, I think I've already said this to you, but if they, like, when you get to the close, finding out what kind of payment they want to use, because it's going to be a 3% upcharge if they do a credit card.

[1:09:35]
Austin Lortie: Yeah, yeah. And it's just, like, good. Like, you don't ask if they're ready to move forward. You ask, like, so, like, what payment would you use, like, on this, right? It's, like, a phased in. So, like, I like using those questions as, like, soft closes. The other thing, this is a conversation for another day. Are you familiar with, like, assumptive language, Athena?

[1:09:59]
Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): Yeah. Um, yeah, assuming they close.

[1:10:03]
Austin Lortie: Or, like, throughout the process, like, saying things in a manner where it implies that they're going to move forward. It's like saying things in first person as opposed to, like, you are going to do this once we get you enrolled. Like, talking more through that frame as opposed to, like, reading through that script yesterday, I noticed a lot of it was, like, they, them, as opposed to you, yours, if that makes sense. Um, so that's, like, likely another thing that you'll see, like, as I'm running through those exploratory calls, it'll probably be more framed as, like, first person as opposed to third.

[1:10:39]
Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): Yeah, so it flips. Because the examples of, like, done badly is they.

[1:10:46]
Austin Lortie: And you is, yes.

[1:10:48]
Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): So just, if it's, like, you know, most searchers, you know, do this, and it's wrong, and da-da-da-da-da, and then they  up their deal, and blah-blah-blah-blah-blah. So, like, that's why I wrote, yeah, the 10. Or then, what is that? First person, third person, or second person, .

[1:11:06]
Austin Lortie: I don't know. haven't been written that way.

[1:11:10]
Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): So I wasn't like, you probably  up your deal, and you probably  up blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

[1:11:14]
Austin Lortie: So instead, what we do is we guide you through this da-da-da-da-da.

[1:11:20]
Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): So every time I start saying, but what we do instead, it's meant to be directed at them. I might just scramble it sometimes in my brain, but the intention was like, bad people, not you. You, like with us, is going to be this. So, yeah. But again, you know, as you go through it, you feel like there's better ways to position it and stuff. I know it's a big script. Like, I was really struggling with my sales coach about it. And honestly, I kind of feel like we need to weight it more back to the search services. Um, yeah, and we're a search and match company. Like we're going to put businesses in front of you. We're not, we can't close them for you, you know, but we're here to support you through the process.

[1:12:12]
Austin Lortie: And I haven't quite nailed how to describe that. I, I would leave it alone because in like, because if that's a concern, it'll come up in the form of an objection and they can handle it at that point versus like when you're charging 70 K or a hundred grand, right? It's like, you want to build as much value as you possibly can. So like, if they don't ask the question, that means it's not a concern, right? If they ask the question, then let's have that conversation.

[1:12:41]
Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): But like, don't create objections for the sake of creating objections, you know? Great. Um, that's my, cool. Okay. Um, and then, so after intro call, have you and Anika run through that process?
ACTION ITEM: Work w/ Anika to get access to GPT summary tool for post-call summaries - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/287299765?timestamp=4370.9999

[1:12:56]
Austin Lortie: What happens with the GPT and like summary for the script? So she tried to give me access. That's something that we need to work on today, probably. She tried to give me access to that GPT, and she was like, hey, does this pull up for you? I was like, no, no, no. So we haven't been able to get it to work on my side yet. So post intro call, no, I don't outside of like what's in the sales process.

[1:13:22]
Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): Okay, so do you have time scheduled with her today?

[1:13:27]
Austin Lortie: Yeah, 11 to noon.

[1:13:28]
Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): Okay, great. So right after our call, so like, then you guys can take the script from today, and she can run that GPT with you. And then assuming that we move Morgan to an exploration call tomorrow, how are you feeling about running that tomorrow also?

[1:13:47]
Austin Lortie: Not as well as running the intro call, but I feel fine. Like, it'll be good. So like, my plan today is like, I want to run through that at least like one or two more times, just to get like a really good feel for how it goes. I even tried to go in and simplify your script so it was easy to talk through. And I was like, I went from 16 pages to 13. So I'm like, okay, I'm just going to read this script. I'm going to get familiar with it. And then hopefully in the next couple of weeks, I'm just fluid enough where I can use it as a reference as opposed to a word-for-word verbatim script.

[1:14:24]
Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): Yeah, okay. And then we've got an hour scheduled tomorrow. We can try to run through whatever. I mean, we don't need to do the objection handling and stuff because I think you'll be fine with that.

[1:14:35]
Austin Lortie: But maybe run through the script part itself. Yeah, yeah. I think that would be definitely a good use of time tomorrow.

[1:14:45]
Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): Okay. And then I have an exploration call booked on Thursday. I saw. How would you feel about running that, even though I ran the intro?

[1:14:59]
Austin Lortie: That's up to you. It's like... A bit of a, like, there's not a lot of continuity there, but I'm like, it's fine.

[1:15:07]
Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): Well, I can be on it with you.

[1:15:10]
Austin Lortie: You just might have to do the intro on that one as opposed to me.

[1:15:14]
Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): Yeah, so I can be like, you know, we already kind of rescheduled it, so I'll be like, hey, thanks so much. I'm bringing in Austin, who, you know, is kind of, I want to say something like he's who I bring in at this point of the discussion, and he's, you know, getting up to speed and going to be taking this on. So I wanted him to lead the discussion today, but I'm here to, you know, fill in any contacts or anything, and I filled him in on our previous conversation. Well, honestly, I'm not, she's kind of gives me like, I know everything I need to know. So I just think she'll be good from, like, the objection handling standpoint. Like, I don't think she's going to close, right? I don't have a good, it's. So when somebody comes into it and they're like, I know everything, and I try to give them some pointers and just point out some things, she's kind of like, yeah, I guess I never thought of that. know, it's not. So usually when they're like that, they just they're kind of like, I know what I'm doing. I just need to know how much it is to get leads. Like, you know, I've got an amazing corporate career and I'm I'm under control and like, and then they'll hear the price tag and they're like, ah, you know, so so I think I think she I'm not concerned about how clunky it is because I'm not really feeling.

[1:16:40]
Austin Lortie: I'm not bullish on this one.

[1:16:42]
Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): Yeah, exactly. So I think I think it could be, but I think she'll be one of those people that will come up with a bunch of like, well, how many closes can I speak to a client?

[1:16:50]
Austin Lortie: Like, I feel like she'll be one of those. Yeah, that sounds that sounds great. I love those people.

[1:16:57]
Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): I'm glad you do because they put me on the. Defensive, and then I get , and then I'm like, goddammit, I've lost it again, you know?

[1:17:06]
Austin Lortie: I went and hit a job fair here in Houston with one of my buddies. I used to be his manager, and would always slap people around and do hard closes behind him, you know? And we were at this job fair, and he's like, Austin, you don't want to go slap this dude around over here? Like, about, like, because he's like, if you're only in sales for the money, don't even talk to me. And I'm like, bro, what are you talking about? Why is anybody in sales? Like, you know, like, we're not here, like, don't get me wrong, I like solving problems, but, like, I also like getting paid. But he was like, oh, Austin, you want to go slap this guy? Are you sure you don't want to slap him around before you leave?

[1:17:42]
Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): I'm like, dude, you're funny. I think it's, like, it's the closest thing to entrepreneurship that you can get, though, you know? Like, it's the only role in any company where you can determine how much you make, you know? Like, apart from the founder, that's cool. You know, I wish... I really wish I would have gotten more of an appetite for sales when I was younger because I'm seeing how much it could have like helped me solve a lot of problems like in all of my businesses, you know. But also it's like you're not like I can't tell you how many jobs I had in London. They do not value marketing at all. So like I took a massive pay cut when I went from L.A.

[1:18:24]
Austin Lortie: to London. I bet.

[1:18:26]
Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): Yeah. And then I moved jobs for the same amount of money. Like I could not get a raise to save my life there because it was just like 40K was like the top earners in the marketing industry.

[1:18:39]
Austin Lortie: It was  crazy. And so marketing is arguably more important than sales, in my opinion. And I say that as a salesperson and a lot of salespeople think marketing is worthless. But if we do our job right, then your job is much easier, you know, like if I do my job right in the market.

[1:19:00]
Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): Then you have a well-informed, well-validated, qualified person that is going to be a good client for us.

[1:19:10]
Austin Lortie: I always really wanted to be an entrepreneur when I was young and then got into sales because it was a good way to upskill from a business acumen perspective. And then the older I got, the more I found out that I'm just not good at finding gaps in the market. And like identifying problems, right? Like I'm a better execution than I am at innovation. And then I learned about ETA and was like, what?

[1:19:42]
Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): Yeah, but, you know, like sales is, like I said, it's like it's the closest thing to entrepreneurship because you're kind of the master of like your earnings, you know, and like no other role gets that. Maybe there are. Like some commission or bonus structure or whatever, but like it's truly your oyster. Also, I'm conscious we need to work through the targets and stuff, but.

[1:20:17]
Austin Lortie: You're saying quota wise?

[1:20:19]
Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): Yeah, so like at this new level, I don't I don't think we need to do three to four clients a month. I just haven't had a time to get up in the spreadsheet.

[1:20:30]
Austin Lortie: Have you had any thoughts around that? I say we still aim for three to four. That's my thought process. It's one a week, you know, it depends on like what inbound lead flow looks like and what our conversion rates ultimately come to. You know what I mean? But like. I'm always been like. Let's let's see where our baseline is, right? Like and then like let's constantly try and improve improve on that. Like I just like I love breaking records. Every single month, you know, like, if like, I did one one month, and then two the next, and then three the following, and then four after that, like, it's just very satisfying to see that progress. So like, I'm always a fan of like, hefty goals with like, nuance, right? It's like, the funnels are not always going to look the same every single month in terms of inbound lead flow. And like, as long as we're profitable on a month over month basis, like everyone's happy, but like, just because like, it's like, I don't like complacency, I guess, like, I'm always trying to strive to do better and more. So like, I'm not, I don't, I don't think you're close, or like, those numbers are crazy. Like, I would just leave them like, and like, let's push towards that. Like, that's our North Star.

[1:21:45]
Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): And like, we're talking about like, one deal on a weekly basis.

[1:21:48]
Austin Lortie: So if we see, hopefully, and I just don't know what conversion rates will look like, right? Like, my guess is like, you put five in front of me, and I do a good job of what I do. Like, I should be able To at least close one of those on a weekly basis, you know, so like, and given it's going to take some time, and that's maybe another good question to ask you, Athena, is like, do you have a good pulse on like, time to close on your site? And I think I asked you this in the interview process, but I'm just curious.

[1:22:14]
Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): Yeah, it's interesting. So just real quick on that. So we're on the same page. You're so comfortable if we keep it three to four, the commissions on the first 30k of the amount? Or what were you thinking there?

[1:22:32]
Austin Lortie: That's up to you. I'm like, it can be on the first 30k, and we can leave the six and 8% if you want, on that side of things. And then, yeah, I think that's fine.

[1:22:43]
Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): I'm like, okay, because basically, now that I'm bought into actually delivering for 12 months, I have to stock a lot away of that upfront to make sure that I can pay for 12 months of delivery.

[1:22:57]
Austin Lortie: So that that was my concern there is like, So we're committing to like 12 months of the team doing a search for them.

[1:23:05]
Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): So I need to make sure I'm really managing cash flow to be able to accommodate that.

[1:23:11]
Austin Lortie: Yeah, I'm like, let's get in and find some success. And like, we can always like have a conversation about that at a later date. But I'm fine with where those numbers are at right now.

[1:23:21]
Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): You know what I mean? Okay, great. And then it gives you some flexibility in terms of like, experimenting with like payment terms and stuff too. So as long as 30k is collected up front, then you can see if you want to split the, you know, other 40 over time or something like that.

[1:23:35]
Austin Lortie: What was I gonna tell you? So here is my only one and only concern on that is like, if we hit 70, and I don't think this is gonna happen. But like, let's say we're, we're forecasting three to four deals on a monthly basis. And then we come to find out it's half of that, then I'd want to renegotiate that slightly. And I'm a reasonable human being, Athena. So I'm sure that we'll find some common ground there.

[1:24:07]
Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): No problem. But yeah, as of today, just leave it how it is and we'll push for it. Okay, great. Then time to close. So it's been interesting because I've had a couple people come back after like four to six months of talking to me. Two of my clients so far have done that. Most of them, it's like as quick as you can get the exploration call in. If they're serious, Justin was like first week of January, you know? So he like, we did an intro call, we did an expo call the next day. He had a check-in with his wife and he was signed up within a week. So you will have far more availability too. It was like they weren't getting on it. Sometimes they're not getting on the books for like three, four, six weeks, you know, two months sometimes. So if you're you're you're like. Being able to jump on a call with them kind of as immediately as they book, take them through intro, ex-glow, and then have a follow-up call, you know, like sometimes I can close on the exploration call. Sometimes, most of the time when they're married, they want to check with their wife, which is why in the intro I check who the wife is and that sort of thing. Because I've had people get on calls and they're like, I haven't even told my wife I want to buy a business.

[1:25:26]
Austin Lortie: I'm like, uh, okay. That's not a problem. Can I have two seconds again? I'm sorry.

[1:25:34]
Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): Yeah, I need to wrap. Yeah, I was going to say let's wrap up so that you can, you know, prep for that call.

[1:25:41]
Austin Lortie: got a few other things I'd love to do before the call, but are you feeling good going into this one? Yeah, we'll be fine.

[1:25:47]
Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): Okay, cool. I'll see you in just over a half an hour.

[1:25:50]
Austin Lortie: Sounds good. Thanks, Athena. Bye.
