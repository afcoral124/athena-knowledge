Location: 1:15:03–1:15:20
Speakers involved: Athena Simpson

[BORDERLINE #1 - Requires Review]
Location: 8:22
Content excerpt: "…sorry, I just had a timer go off and I have to scan this thing. Okay, apologies. I have a very timely thing I have to do every day at a certain time."
Business relevance argument: Brief interruption; maintains speaker continuity and quickly returns to business examples (deal sizes, valuation).
Personal content argument: Purely personal aside unrelated to the topic.
Recommendation: KEEP—very brief; removing could create a jarring cut mid-thought.

---
[BORDERLINE #2 - Requires Review]
Location: 21:39–21:44
Content excerpt: "Athena: Wow, cool. Luke: I just didn't like that."
Business relevance argument: Minimal; but serves as a conversational acknowledgment before continuing deal details.
Personal content argument: Adds little value.
Recommendation: KEEP—very short phatic expressions that preserve flow.

Additional Notes and Patterns
- Repeated mishearing of key acronyms/terms: LOI→"ly", SBA→"SPA", P&L→"P and out", sale leaseback→"sale at least back"/"sale these back", triple net→"triple and that"/"triple that".
- Brokerage name confusion: CGK Business Sales repeatedly appears as CDK/CJK/CGAK; broker name "Derek" momentarily misheard as "Eric."
- Client initials inconsistency: "JG" appears elsewhere; later a "JB" is referenced in a context likely referring to the same person. Review initials across the transcript/CRM.
- Several truncated/garbled sentences suggest ASR difficulties (background noise/overlap). Examples at 6:43, 20:07–20:15, 22:11, 27:00. These should be re-checked against the recording for clarity.

Speaker Attribution
- No strong evidence of speaker-role reversal; some back-to-back “Yeah, exactly” style agreements could be from adjacent speakers, but do not materially affect comprehension.

Segment Mapping (High-level)
- 0:12–0:18: REMOVE (small talk)
- 0:25–18:51: KEEP (deal screening strategy; real estate/sale leaseback; opportunity zones)
- 19:38–33:00: KEEP (deal updates; broker outreach; CRM hygiene)
- 33:00–48:49: KEEP (post-LOI process; lender term sheet/commitment letter review; working capital; DSCR; SBA mechanics)
- 48:49–1:18:33: KEEP (team learning/scaling; diligence/renegotiation strategy; client management; sourcing/prioritization)
- 1:18:33–1:19:00: KEEP (off-market sourcing status)
- 1:19:00–1:20:54: REMOVE (daylight savings/time zone logistics and travel aside)
- 1:20:54–end: KEEP (closing pleasantries are brief and acceptable)

This mapping preserves all deal, financing, valuation, and strategy content while removing time-wasting tangents.
