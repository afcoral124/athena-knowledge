[Error #1 - Category: Misheard Acronym/Business Term]
Location: ~1:03 / Speaker: Austin Lortie
Transcript excerpt: "I met a really good channel partner that's doing like QAV, but he was like..."
Issue: "QAV" is not a standard M&A term in this context.
Likely intended: "QoE" (Quality of Earnings)
Confidence: High
Reasoning: In acquisition due diligence, service providers commonly offer Quality of Earnings (QoE) work; “QAV” appears to be a phonetic misrecognition.
Impact: High - Mislabels a core due diligence service.

---
[Error #2 - Category: Homophone/Near-homophone]
Location: 4:21 / Speaker: Athena Simpson
Transcript excerpt: "She was singing your phrases. Oh, that's sweet."
Issue: "phrases" used where a compliment is being described.
Likely intended: "praises"
Confidence: High
Reasoning: Common idiom is “singing your praises.” Context is positive feedback about Austin.
Impact: Low-Medium

---
[Error #3 - Category: Entity Name Inconsistency]
Location: 10:40 vs earlier references / Speaker: Athena Simpson (and prior mentions)
Transcript excerpt: "She was at M&A LaunchPod." (earlier repeated as "M&A Launchpad")
Issue: Inconsistent event naming ("LaunchPod" vs "Launchpad").
Likely intended: "M&A Launchpad"
Confidence: High
Reasoning: Earlier references consistently say “Launchpad.” “LaunchPod” likely ASR confusion.
Impact: Medium - Could confuse the event being discussed.

---
[Error #4 - Category: Misheard Entity/Proper Noun]
Location: 13:14 / Speaker: Athena Simpson
Transcript excerpt: "people I listen to on Acquiring Wines or the people I hear speaking at events."
Issue: Podcast name appears incorrect.
Likely intended: "Acquiring Minds"
Confidence: High
Reasoning: “Acquiring Minds” is a known SMB/M&A podcast; “Acquiring Wines” is unlikely.
Impact: Medium

---
[Error #5 - Category: Misheard Proper Noun/Acronym]
Location: 17:06 / Speaker: Austin Lortie
Transcript excerpt: "I leveraged Shack GPT to give me some ideas..."
Issue: Tool name misheard.
Likely intended: "ChatGPT"
Confidence: High
Reasoning: Phonetic similarity; “ChatGPT” is a well-known tool often mentioned in work contexts.
Impact: Medium

---
[Error #6 - Category: Grammatical Issue Obscuring Meaning]
Location: ~19:58-20:20 / Speaker: Athena Simpson
Transcript excerpt: "Our combined experience has saw us about thousands of deals worth hundreds of millions of dollars..."
Issue: Ungrammatical phrase that obscures meaning.
Likely intended: "has seen us evaluate thousands of deals worth hundreds of millions of dollars"
Confidence: High
Reasoning: Standard way to express cumulative experience in deal review.
Impact: Medium

---
[Error #7 - Category: Business Terminology Distortion]
Location: ~20:20 / Speaker: Athena Simpson
Transcript excerpt: "...our team has gotten 100% of clients and designed LOI."
Issue: “designed LOI” is incorrect usage in this context.
Likely intended: "to signed LOIs" or "to sign LOIs"
Confidence: High
Reasoning: In deal funnels, the milestone is an LOI being “signed,” not “designed.”
Impact: High - Affects a key performance claim.

---
[Error #8 - Category: Entity Names (Inconsistency)]
Location: Multiple
- 4:24 / Speaker: Austin: "And then I dropped the ball on Arvin..."
- ~22:00 / Speaker: Athena: "that guy air-voned... he thought we..."
- ~26:00 / Speaker: Athena: "...we got in the weeds with Erevan when..."
Issue: Same person appears to be referenced with different spellings.
Likely intended: A single individual, likely "Arvin" or "Arvind"
Confidence: Medium
Reasoning: Conversational context suggests one person; repeated but inconsistent phonetic renderings.
Impact: Medium - Confusing for follow-up or record-keeping.

---
[Error #9 - Category: Misheard Event Name]
Location: 12:14 / Speaker: Athena Simpson
Transcript excerpt: "it was an S and bash where you really need to have your talking points..."
Issue: Event name misheard.
Likely intended: "SMBash"
Confidence: High
Reasoning: SMBash is a known SMB acquisition conference; "S and bash" is an ASR artifact.
Impact: Medium

---
[Error #10 - Category: Semantic Inconsistency]
Location: 0:00 / Speaker: Athena Simpson
Transcript excerpt: "Let me tell my speaker. Going well, thanks."
Issue: Phrase does not fit context of starting a call.
Likely intended: "Let me test my speaker."
Confidence: Medium
Reasoning: Common pre-call check phrasing; “tell my speaker” is unnatural.
Impact: Low

---
[Error #11 - Category: Semantic Inconsistency]
Location: ~1:03 / Speaker: Austin Lortie
Transcript excerpt: "...swallowing quotation marks. I think that's the fifth intro call I've ran."
Issue: “swallowing quotation marks” is odd/unidiomatic.
Likely intended: Possibly “using ‘quote-unquote’,” or “overusing quotes/air quotes”
Confidence: Low-Medium
Reasoning: The phrase is unusual; may be an ASR misrendering of a filler or aside.
Impact: Low

---
[Error #12 - Category: Misheard Acronym]
Location: ~47:00 / Speaker: Athena Simpson
Transcript excerpt: "of those NDAs, how many did you receive SIMs back for?"
Issue: “SIMs” vs the more standard “CIMs” in US M&A.
Likely intended: "CIMs" (Confidential Information Memoranda)
Confidence: Medium
Reasoning: In US buy-side processes, “CIM” is standard; some markets use “IM/SIM,” but given context, “CIM” is more likely.
Impact: Medium

---
[Error #13 - Category: Misheard Acronym]
Location: ~49:00 / Speaker: Athena Simpson
Transcript excerpt: "How many LIs did you submit? How many of those were accepted?"
Issue: “LIs” likely missing the “O.”
Likely intended: "LOIs" (Letters of Intent)
Confidence: High
Reasoning: Standard terminology is LOI; ASR often drops short vowels.
Impact: High

---
[Error #14 - Category: Entity Name (Proper Noun)]
Location: 9:23 / Speaker: Austin Lortie
Transcript excerpt: "He and I were both facilitators in Cody's community."
Issue: Possible misspelling of a known figure’s name in SMB/M&A.
Likely intended: "Codie" (as in Codie Sanchez)
Confidence: Medium
Reasoning: In SMB circles, “Codie Sanchez” runs a well-known community; “Cody” could be wrong or could refer to someone else. Ambiguous but worth a check.
Impact: Low-Medium

---
[Error #15 - Category: Semantic Inconsistency]
Location: 14:06 / Speaker: Austin Lortie
Transcript excerpt: "what do you think the real? Value in leveraging a search and match for a minute."
Issue: Fragmented phrasing and “for a minute” seems out of place.
Likely intended: "Value in leveraging a search-and-match firm (like ours)" (without “for a minute”)
Confidence: Medium
Reasoning: The phrase appears clipped, likely due to ASR truncation and filler words.
Impact: Low

REMOVALS (Personal/Off-Topic)

[REMOVAL #1 - Type: Personal/Off-Topic]
Location: ~18:22–~18:40
Speakers involved: Athena
Content excerpt:
"Athena: Oh, my gosh. Gamora came in and sat. She knows how to, did I tell you, she knows how to, like, bulldoze my door. Cole's dog is figured out because it's not anything but, like, a latch. It's, like, just one of those, like, ball things where you, like, push it. And she just, like, slams through the door now to open the door."
Reasoning:
Extended anecdote about a dog and home door latch is personal and not related to business, training, or sales process.
Context impact: None—conversation transitions immediately back to the intro meeting walkthrough (“Cool. Okay. I’m going to pull up the intro meeting…”).
Recommended action: REMOVE ~18:22–~18:40 (retain the subsequent sentence beginning "Cool. Okay. I'm going to pull up the intro meeting...")

---

BORDERLINE SEGMENTS - Requires Review

[BORDERLINE #1 - Requires Review]
Location: ~6:40–~7:47
Content excerpt: Athena’s anecdote about being grilled on credentials at Launchpad, cultural context via her TA, and reactions (“…had me almost up against a wall… grilling me on what made me credentialed…”).
Business relevance argument: Provides insight into event dynamics, broker/searcher culture, and how to handle credential challenges; relevant to training and sales conversations.
Personal content argument: Includes personal anecdote, strong language, and cultural commentary that could be seen as tangential.
Recommendation: KEEP — It supports the training purpose of the call (handling objections/credibility at events).

[BORDERLINE #2 - Requires Review]
Location: “SCREEN SHARING” meta-lines at 19:22
Content excerpt: "SCREEN SHARING: Athena started screen sharing - WATCH: [link] ... Can you see this?"
Business relevance argument: Documents the transition to training walkthrough and materials; helpful for context in a training transcript.
Personal content argument: Meta/logistical annotations can be considered non-conversational clutter.
Recommendation: KEEP — Maintains context for the subsequent step-by-step training discussion.

Notes on Patterns and Systematic ASR Issues Observed
- LOI consistently misrendered as “LI” or distorted (“designed LOI”) — high-impact term in this domain.
- CIM frequently rendered as “SIM” — check across the transcript; consider standardizing based on regional usage.
- QoE rendered as “QAV” — common ASR confusion; ensure consistent correction to QoE.
- Proper nouns/podcast/tools: “Acquiring Minds” → “Acquiring Wines,” “ChatGPT” → “Shack GPT.”
- Event names inconsistently transcribed: “M&A Launchpad” → “LaunchPod”; “SMBash” → “S and bash.”
- Person names: “Arvin/air-voned/Erevan” — unify to a single, verified spelling.
- Occasional fragmented phrases (“Let me tell my speaker”; “search and match for a minute”) indicate truncation/omission.

Segment Mapping (High-level)
- 0:00–1:00: KEEP (brief greetings + performance reflections/training context)
- 1:00–12:11: KEEP (conference leads, partner referrals caution, broker ecosystem, competitor landscape)
- 12:11–19:22: KEEP (pricing handling, process framing) except REMOVAL #1 at ~18:22–~18:40 (dog anecdote)
- 19:22–57:37: KEEP (screen share + full intro meeting training, objection handling, financing/criteria/timeline walkthrough, closing/logistics)

Speaker Attribution
- No clear cases of swapped speakers; turn-taking and roles appear consistent (Athena training/coaching; Austin reporting, asking).

This analysis prioritizes errors affecting core M&A terminology, metrics, and named entities, and trims only clearly personal small talk while preserving all training and deal-relevant content.
