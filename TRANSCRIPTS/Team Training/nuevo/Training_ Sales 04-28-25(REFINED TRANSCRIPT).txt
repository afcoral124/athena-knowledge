[00:00:00]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Good morning, Austin.

[00:03:48]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): So. Can I fire, like, ten questions at you? And then we can... I'm like, if you haven't had time, for sure.

[00:03:57]
Austin Lorte (Unrestricted): But if you don't, I'm like, I can make our agenda. Well, what I was thinking would be good is at least maybe trying to get through an intro practice, and then I can give you some feedback, and then we can do another one tomorrow for that intro call. Yeah, yeah, I think it's perfect.

[00:04:16]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Great, and then I read through your objections, so we'll talk through that too, but yeah, why don't you get your questions answered first, and then we'll go from there. And then I need to end at 9.30, because I need to try to give this off-market opportunity a call for Andrew. So that's exciting. Yeah, he came to us and said, I have all these companies I'd love for you to contact. So the team started contacting him, Ryan started contacting him, and there's one guy in particular that started showing interest. So, but he's like thinking that we're an internet scam, so I'm going to call him and... just see if I can get him, like, comfortable, like, hey, you know, you're going to be meeting our buyer before you sign anything that could be an issue. But he's like, I've heard of people, like, some scam on the internet, and they get paid 10% down, and then it's 90% seller finance, and then they sell all the assets. I'm like, God, that's horrible.

[00:05:23]
Austin Lorte (Unrestricted): But you're saying about private equity?

[00:05:26]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Yeah, no, I, like, I'm sure if I can get him on the phone, then I can get him a little bit more comfortable. But Andrew's like, I'll go down there and meet him. And I was like, I don't want you doing our job either, but I was trying to get out of this Canadian deal, which sucks, because it was, it's such a cool deal.

[00:05:48]
Austin Lorte (Unrestricted): What is it?

[00:05:50]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): So, Andrew is a commercial real estate, like, expert and broker, and he's been in real... For, like, 20 years, he's trained, you know, he's been a trainer, he's, like, run massive, like, you know, offices and real estate programs. What's that?

[00:06:10]
Austin Lorte (Unrestricted): That's the enterprise sales guy, yeah.

[00:06:12]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): No, that's Justin. Andrew is based in Oklahoma, but very much, like, exciting, like Justin, you know, like, Andrew's one of my favorites. So he has this, like, insane commercial real estate background, training background, leadership background. And through my personal network, I found a guy that was selling a mortgage broker coaching CRM business.

[00:06:38]
Austin Lorte (Unrestricted): Oh, interesting.

[00:06:40]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Yeah, but the business is based, like, in Canada, even though the customers and... Fresh LLC. Huh?

[00:06:50]
Austin Lorte (Unrestricted): So it's a fresh LLC in the States. He can relocate that now.

[00:06:54]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Yeah, but he's just starting to get super risk-averse and, like, like... seeing all the hair on it, and he's like adding it all together and not even wanting to sign an LOI at this point. And I was like, okay, but if you didn't have to, I was like, if it was available for $0, would you take it? And he's like, yeah. And I was like, okay, so we have a pricing problem. And if you didn't have to put a PG on it, how would that make you feel? And he's like, well, that might change things. And I was like, I've told you, you have financing options, him specifically, because I know private debt funds that have impact funds for certain areas, and Oklahoma is one of them.

[00:07:35]
Austin Lorte (Unrestricted): Oh, that's cool.

[00:07:37]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): And they'll go on smaller deals. And I was like, but we can't, you can't have that conversation until it's under offer. So he's like, I don't want to waste everybody's time by putting it under LOI. I was like, how is it wasting that man's time to go and see if you can find a couple million dollars to pay him?

[00:07:52]
Austin Lorte (Unrestricted): That's crazy. That's funny. People are weird.

[00:07:56]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): People are so... But I mean, it's like, get another one. It's like, it's right- in of me, and he's like, you know, like, I'm like, every deal is going to have problems, but he's starting to like question his ability to manage a 28 person team remotely. And, you know, just the things that people do, but he hasn't even like signed an LOI yet.

[00:08:19]
Austin Lorte (Unrestricted): Like, walk before you run. A bite at a time. That's always what I think of.

[00:08:25]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Yeah, finding at this point, like, like, worst case, you have a couple of financing discussions, find out it's not possible. You tell this guy, you can't do it, you know, but it might change your mind if they're like, wait, I don't have to put a personal guarantee and like all of my available funds into this because you don't have to do 10% on the private debt either.

[00:08:44]
Austin Lorte (Unrestricted): That's interesting. That's interesting. Let me know how that evolves. That's super interesting. I'm like sad I'm not in your deal channels, but it's a good thing because it'd be a massive time waster for me because I'd be like in there looking at what everybody's doing.

[00:09:02]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Yeah, so then on the pricing for us, I am leaning towards this like 70k covers your onboarding and your first 12 months of service. And then 30k when you sign a purchase agreement. So there's no contingency on the loan or closing. But obviously, it's like signing the purchase agreement, which is closing.

[00:09:31]
Austin Lorte (Unrestricted): So what do you think about this? I like the 70k and then 30k on the purchase agreement. And I also really like, so like, let's say somebody gives us an objection about the upfront fee, then we could go 50 finance the remaining over the term of the 12 months, which comes up like less than two grand a month, right?

[00:09:52]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Right.

[00:09:53]
Austin Lorte (Unrestricted): And then let's say they say, Oh, we don't want, we don't want to commit for 12 months, then we say... Okay, $50,000 for six months of service, and then you financed the remaining $20,000 over the remaining six months. I don't know how you feel about that.

[00:10:10]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Yeah, we need people bought in for 12 months. So their timeline is pretty less than that. It's just leading them down the unrealistic path that they're going to get this all done and wrapped up in six months. So I'm just seeing it now with all of our clients hitting the six-month mark, and they're starting to get super squirrely, whereas if I'd signed them up for 12 months, then this is just part of the process, right? So I feel like it's a re-education during the sales process. If I sold you six months, I'd be setting you up for failure because it's not going to happen in six months.

[00:10:51]
Austin Lorte (Unrestricted): The only reason I brought that up is because what I noticed about the enterprise sales guy, whose name you just told me, No, it's not Jeff. It's James.

[00:11:02]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Justin.

[00:11:05]
Austin Lorte (Unrestricted): I think about him as well as in the other one is the black dude that was really mad or that's been giving you a headache now. You know what I'm talking about? Yeah. So like the thing that I saw with both of those calls is like both of them were like, oh, it's not a 12 month commitment like everybody else. Like I get to see how this works out instead. You know what I mean? So like I agree with you in the sense of like, and it just depends, right? It's like, do we care if we lose deals if they're not committed for 12 months? Because if we have enough volume, then maybe we don't care, right? But like, or are we in the business to try and capture as many opportunities as we possibly can is kind of how I was thinking about that, right? So if you're in the business of, hey, we want to capture as many as we can, and we know some are going to turn out. And I don't know if that's necessarily the best model, right? Maybe it makes more sense to have a six month option. Not offering that up front, right? It's like trying to go for the 12, trying to get through that education process, and if we're getting strong resistance, but we're willing to commit for six months, it doesn't make sense to still sell that opportunity.

[00:12:15]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Yeah, I mean, even if they got it under offer in three months, like they're not finishing in six months, you know what I mean? So like, I just, I don't want to, I don't want to put six months in people's head.

[00:12:27]
Austin Lorte (Unrestricted): Cool. Yeah, I'm good. I'm good.

[00:12:29]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): If we can, if we can try it, like, you know, I think we'll have pretty high volume from Acquiring Minds to like weed it out. And to me, getting better quality, higher paying, less clients that are more likely to go to the finish line is better overall as a business for us. Because we'll get those post fees, which we're not getting right now with these people. You know, like, unrealistic expectations or, like, you know, just dipping their toe in. So I'd love if there's a way for us to, like, if splitting up the payments is something that needs to happen, that's one thing, right? But to get in their minds, it is a minimum 12-month commitment, or it's a 12-month commitment.

[00:13:22]
Austin Lorte (Unrestricted): Yeah.

[00:13:23]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Because we are in the business of setting realistic expectations, and we would be setting them up for failure if we told them they were going to have us all wrapped up in six months. We're not Cody Sanchez or Ben Kelly, you know?

[00:13:38]
Austin Lorte (Unrestricted): I'm with it. I'm with it.

[00:13:40]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): So that's what I'm thinking about it, because then if they're bought into 12 months, then they should chill, right? They're like, okay, I'm here for 12 months. Like, if I get it done sooner, awesome. Obviously, we're going to try to get it done sooner, because we'll be able to, like, you know, get... our fee earlier. So we're still incentivized to get them there, but we want them to find the right deal and take the time to do it. And it's usually the amount of time that we need to like, you know, we're doing it like from scratch, off-market search. It takes a couple months for that to warm up for us to start putting those deals in front of them.

[00:14:20]
Austin Lorte (Unrestricted): At least a couple.

[00:14:23]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Exactly. So I think it would be better mindset-wise to do that. The other thing I was thinking about, but again, like this might cause them to like walk away from it at the important moment, was like, what if we did 50K up front and then 20K at signing LOI? But I don't want that to factor in their decision-making process, right? Like they'll be like, oh, I have to pay another 10K if I sign an LOI. They'll just like sign the thing. So I kind of want to remove that barrier.

[00:14:53]
Austin Lorte (Unrestricted): Here's how I think about this too, right? It's like, if we're getting strong objections consistently in the sales... process, it's like, and I think regardless, right, if we're getting strong objections, and we can't get somebody to close, then just like, cut the BS for lack of a better word. Just like, hey, look, like, because I'm, my guess is like, a lot of people really liked the success fee aspect of what you did. And so my assumption is, is like, we're going to get an objection on the success fee, or like, hey, can't you do this on the back end? Right? So like, if that's true, then we can just explain, it's like, hey, look, like we use the majority of our fee used to be structured as a success fee. Like, unfortunately, SBA changed regulations. And we're still in the process of buying and tuning our revenue model, like, what would make sense for you get that feedback. And if it works, it works. If it doesn't, it doesn't, right. But that way, like, literally every customer that comes across our desk, we can better understand what's preventing them from moving forward from an economics perspective, you know?

[00:15:52]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Yeah, I think it's, it's, it's explaining that, like, no more than 30k can come out of the loan.

[00:15:58]
Austin Lorte (Unrestricted): Right.

[00:16:00]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): So that has to be paid. It has to be paid before they close out of pocket, but it can count towards equity injection. So that's what I'm going to verify with the lenders. Once we kind of get an idea, it's like, hey, would this work?

[00:16:15]
Austin Lorte (Unrestricted): Can this count towards equity injection?

[00:16:18]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): As long as they say yes, then it's like, as long as you close, you're prepaying your down payment. So you just need to be bought in. This is what you are doing, right? That you are actually buying a business. But yeah, I mean, like the other groups, I don't know how they're going to, what they're going to do, right? Because Lehman scale is like gone now on the buy side.

[00:16:46]
Austin Lorte (Unrestricted): Right. That's crazy.

[00:16:48]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Yeah. And so like everyone's going to have to charge up front and it has to be a reasonable fee and it has to be documented. So I think what you can say is like, you know, these other firms might not even be following this. The fact that there's an SOP change and you might be out of pocket all that money if you sign an agreement and you owe that and not be able to put it in the loan, right? And they're not going to be SBA compliant. Like, you know, Athena, our founder, is having multiple conversations with multiple lenders to make sure that everything is compliant and will sail through. I don't, you know, know Dave, like, Collinson doesn't even, like, pay attention to that stuff. I don't know what Andre's doing or if he has any, like, SBA relationships, but I've got tons, you know, and I'm always happy to them to figure out what the best way to, like, support our clients is. Yeah, anyway, let's get to your questions. Any more on that?

[00:17:47]
Austin Lorte (Unrestricted): Yeah, yeah, like, well, I think that all sounds fine. That's, yeah. On my side, anyway. So the first one was just, like, how do we support Post-LOI? Is it just, like, advisory they need to come to us to have those conversations? Like, just, like, maybe a bit of color there.

[00:18:06]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Yeah. So the way I describe it is, hang on, I'm finding a new page on my notebook so I can take notes. There we go. Okay. The way I describe it is done for you, search and match, and done with you post, like, matching business to you. So we're there to advise you on how to get the offer and, like, how to negotiate it. Then after LOI, like, what is the process? We'll make introductions or give them resources. So we have, like, roadmaps to pre-LOI. Like, you find a deal. Here's what you do. We have, like, a document that we get them to follow. And then they, at the moment... We're scheduling weekly calls. Some are scheduling weekly calls, some weren't. I'm trying to make it just like the same across all the clients. So like weekly call, plus I get the Slack channel. So we're trading voice notes and video notes back and forth. Like they'll, you know, pull up their model and be like, what's not working here, et cetera. So we advise on the negotiation. We know specifically like, okay, this is on market versus off market. What's the competition situation, et cetera. So we're advising them on like how to play it, depending on all the variables, how to structure it and be competitive and be compliant with SBA and be, you know, managing their risk in how they structure it. And then we have that like amazing template that I've built with like outside advisor. So so it's like, it looks different than the one you've probably seen in the videos that I've shown, but um, so we get them to do that so that we could advise all of them from the same place. And then they have the ability to do the financial modeling. Once they sign an LOI, then it's helping them figure out what to do next and in what order to avoid broken deal costs. So, you know, first it's going to lenders, then it's doing your QoE, then it's getting a purchase agreement drafted. Like what most people do is they'll do it all at or they don't know what to do. We also have like templates for how to collect due diligence documents. And we kind of advise them on how to project manage the whole thing.

[00:20:37]
Austin Lorte (Unrestricted): Yeah, that's helpful.

[00:20:41]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): But we don't do any, and this is really important, we will not be involved in any negotiation conversations or like on the front lines with lenders or owners. That's brokering, which we can't do in 22 states. You have to have a real estate license to be a business broker. So that's why we've structured it this way. That we're advisory, consultative, behind the scenes, but they're going to be on the front lines working with either the business owner directly or the broker and the owner on market. It's really important to point out with off-market, because they're all obsessed with off-market, is there's probably five times the amount of work for them.

[00:21:20]
Austin Lorte (Unrestricted): And we can tell them how to do it, but we're not going to do it for them. Yeah, in terms of prepping financial statements, modeling, all of that. But the owner doesn't know what's going on either, right?

[00:21:32]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): So a broker normally helps guide them through the process and getting them ready for sale. So they're going to have to do all the work that the broker would normally do, and they're going to have to get this person to trust them enough to guide them through the process without a broker. So if they're a first-timer trying to do that, most of the time they end up bottling it, because they're emotional on that. So we have to advise them a lot on how they actually take this person through that process.

[00:22:00]
Austin Lorte (Unrestricted): I feel like... Who are we? Conversation, like post-close, like there's a lot of like nuanced things that is involved in off-market deals, I'm sure.

[00:22:08]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): No, just post-close, like they find somebody that like doesn't know how to sell their business and they're somebody that also does not know how to buy a business. So it's like the blind leading the blind and both are emotional, both are scared. So they have to lead the owner through a process and they don't know how to do that. So if they try to do that on their own, right, they're probably not going to get there very easily as opposed to us being like, okay, so we have a document that's actually like the stages of dating your owner, right? Like what you do at the various stages of questions that you're asking, what you want. And we kind of relate it to like blind date, you know, getting married, blah, blah, blah. So like helping people understand where they are at in the process and how to deal with the various like things that come up through that process.

[00:22:59]
Austin Lorte (Unrestricted): Yeah, that makes sense. And then let me look, just like is Buyer's Club basically just a Slack group and then like monthly meetings or what's that look like?

[00:23:08]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): No, it's twice a week. Yeah. So once a week, like I get on, well, all the clients just get on, talk through deals. I'm on it. Like, you know, it was until recently the only way that they were getting access to me too. And it will probably go back that way when I hire some more people. So like, it's a way for us all to just kind of like get on, talk through deals, challenges, if they have like questions on financial models or strategy. And then the, that's usually Tuesdays and then Thursdays we bring in a external expert, somebody that's bought a business before, QoE, SBA lender, lawyers, like post-closed transition support. So every week it's someone different where they might do a little presentation and then everybody can ask questions or I'll do a fireside chat. Ask the most common questions. We've done real estate. We've done ROVs. So everything's recorded. And when they join, that's all on their dashboard. So they can go back through all of those previous recordings too.

[00:24:12]
Austin Lorte (Unrestricted): That makes sense. And then I like your trackers as well. I saw your little note in there. I don't think we need to modify those at all. The one question I would have is like the prospecting component. It was talking about like calls. So like walk me through your thought process there. Like are you talking about like calls to inbound leads? Are we pulling cold data and making cold outbound calls? Like what specifically are you referring to in the prospect tracker?

[00:24:44]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): That was trackers given to us. So I was just showing them to you to see what looks good. Let me pull up which you're... Is that in the sales playbook?

[00:24:54]
Austin Lorte (Unrestricted): Yeah, it's in the sales. Do you want me to just share my screen? need to show you.

[00:24:58]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Yeah. Yeah.

[00:25:00]
Austin Lorte (Unrestricted): Yeah. Yeah.

[00:25:01]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): I didn't use any of those because it was just me on my own and I was like I don't know if you have your own trackers like I'd rather you know if you have something that is better for you that you've used in the past open to that. These are ones given to me during my sales training like what's good for me is just kind of that daily visibility accountability.

[00:25:21]
Austin Lorte (Unrestricted): Definitely the daily report. I really liked that too. That was something else that I really appreciated in there.

[00:25:28]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Oh good. Yeah it's helpful for me too to just kind of keep a pulse on what's going on with all the other moving parts.

[00:25:36]
Austin Lorte (Unrestricted): I used to do that unprovoked but weekly as opposed to daily. But I think daily is good.

[00:25:49]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): At least initially so I can help like troubleshoot and stuff but we might like once once you're like okay I'm flying and I'm like he's flying then we can we can look at if we want to adjust that.

[00:26:02]
Austin Lorte (Unrestricted): I think it's just a good thing to do. It's also helpful to just, like, recap your day and make sure that you're being productive.
SCREEN SHARING: Austin started screen sharing - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/286321237?timestamp=1582.769675
So, I got this up now, sorry. This is what I was looking at. So, it's talking about, like, leads assigned, total dials, meaningful conversations, sets, conversion rate to sets, sets on calendar, live call, sets off, or sets closed. So, I think this is valuable, but, like, I think we should maybe modify this slightly because, like, so here's my thought process on prospecting, Athena, and, like, you tell me your feedback on this. So, like, mine was initially, like, looking at all the influencers in the space and then, like, going and actually, like, looking at the... comments, going and doing like a little bit of vetting, and then sending direct messages to each one on more of a personal level. And I think you could do the same thing on LinkedIn, right? Like, if you're looking at like, an enterprise seller that's been in the business for 10 plus years, right? Like, they probably have a decent size net worth, and they're probably just like exhausted for from selling things for the past decade, right? Like, oh, like, I and I can even tell you, like, my grandfather, as well as his son, my uncle, both were in sales forever, like, 1015 years, and then they use the proceeds that they made by or in sales. And my grandfather bought a like jerky delivery business. And then my uncle bought like several franchises, right? So like, I know, it's really common in the sales world. And see, like, all of these franchise guys reaching out, but nobody's reaching out talking about like buying existing businesses. So I think it's like a key point of differentiation, if we can get our messaging, right, I think there's a lot of opportunity there as well. So the downside to LinkedIn, as I'm sure you well know, is you're limited to 200 connections on a weekly basis. So it's hard to do at scale, but even doing sell-side opportunities, Athena, I would tee up probably two or three opportunities on a monthly basis, just reaching out to business owners and being like, hey, man, have you thought about selling your business? So I think that there's an opportunity to generate some leads via LinkedIn as well. So that's kind of how I'm thinking about this. Because the other one, so like talking about like key points of differentiation, like there's a, do you know like the corner office guy on Instagram, Athena? So essentially like one of the things that he does is he'll just pull up like biz by sell listings and then like walk through a pretty quick like just analysis of the listing, right? Like talking about like debt service coverage ratio, questions that you would ask, talking about the industry specifically, and just like doing. Like a high level, maybe like 30 second and minute long analysis of each one of these postings. So I think that that's a good way to generate inbound leads or from a content perspective. So that's kind of like the three channels that I'm thinking, or I should say four because like X as well. I'm just not on search funder currently, and maybe it makes sense. I don't know. I haven't been on it a ton, so I don't know if you've seen a lot of value from it. But I think it's like a hundred bucks a month or something like that.

[00:29:31]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): No, as long as you post, it's free. Like you just have to like add to the discussion. So as long as you're like making posts or contributing, then you can just keep extending and making it free.

[00:29:45]
Austin Lorte (Unrestricted): Cool. That's good to know.

[00:29:47]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): I think they're doing that to keep an active community. Also, I need to get you added to this EBIT WhatsApp group. Like I posted something in there the other day and got like a bunch of leads from it and a bunch of people signing up for our resources. So just like... answering questions. In terms of generating content, I would like to, like, pause on that because I will be doing a whole marketing, like, um, I hate that.

[00:30:13]
Austin Lorte (Unrestricted): Okay, great. Yeah, I know.

[00:30:16]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): In my head, the setter is, you know, like, the way we were working it with our sales coach was, like, the intro call is basically, like, setting and then the exploration call is closing, right? Because it's, like, two-call things. So it's, like, doing that discovery on the first call. So there's probably a simpler way of just, like, what, how many people are we getting from intro call to exploration call? It's what I'm thinking. So it's mostly inbound. And, like, the additional outbound stuff that you want to do, like, that's awesome. But, like, the, in my head, the initial thing is, like, especially with all this stuff coming through, it was just working the stuff that we, yeah, have a pipeline and then all the other additional things coming through, if that's still not enough initially, like, I think, I think it's great to do prospecting for sure. If it's not enough, uh, overall, then it's my, I'll say this too, it's my morning activity.

[00:31:21]
Austin Lorte (Unrestricted): It's like, I believe in having a healthy pipeline. So like every morning I just come in at like six, six 37, you know, like, I'm not like, rushing out of bed to get to work. know what I'm saying? But like the, up until eight o'clock in the morning, that's typically what I'll do. It's like, go surf around on LinkedIn. Like, let's check out what's happening on Instagram. Let's go over here and see what's going on on X, you know? So like, that's how I think about that is like, it's a morning activity where like the only other thing I can do in that time box admin work anyways.

[00:31:51]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): And I'm just like, I like to get out of bed and like get started early in my day. It just like helps set me up for success long-term. So that's how I think.

[00:32:00]
Austin Lorte (Unrestricted): About that, it's like doing that early in the morning.

[00:32:02]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Yeah, so there should be a lot. Like if you're adding to conversations on SearchFunder, the EBIT WhatsApp group, like Twitter is also. Mike Okraby has been like trying to get me out there forever because there's a huge searcher community over on Twitter. So I can share my list of all the people that I follow that are like, you know, but then I'm like, is it a silo too? People that already know about this is why I started posting more on LinkedIn because I'm like, I know there's a bunch of people trapped in a job that like don't want to be there that may not even realize.

[00:32:41]
Austin Lorte (Unrestricted): Like I didn't realize this was a thing until a couple of years ago and I was like, wow, this is amazing.

[00:32:49]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): So yeah, and if you if you need like any of the premium subscriptions on LinkedIn or whatever, we can get that set up.

[00:32:58]
Austin Lorte (Unrestricted): So yeah, I'm not too concerned. I'm like, it's. For the purposes that I use it, you can just use the search bar at the top, and you don't have to go into sophisticated lists and sales nav or anything like that. I don't really need it. It's not really helpful, to be honest.

[00:33:16]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Oh, sorry. Go ahead.

[00:33:22]
Austin Lorte (Unrestricted): I think that's it. The only other thing is, can I read through your agreement in the next couple of days, just some time this week, so as I'm getting objections for that, I have a good understanding of the agreement and where those objections are coming from, as opposed to just shooting for the hip on a call.

[00:33:43]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Yeah, I am going to have to change it, though.

[00:33:45]
Austin Lorte (Unrestricted): Yeah, yeah.

[00:33:46]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): The SOP guidelines, so... we're done.

[00:33:50]
Austin Lorte (Unrestricted): We're done. No hurry there.

[00:33:52]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): No, I can send you the current one, but yeah, I think I'm going to have to rewrite it so that it's compliant. These guideline changes, you know, I think it puts us in a stronger position too in the sales process because it's like, can't we just do success fee? Like, no, nobody's going to work with you if you ask for that and you're using SBA, you know? I've heard that objection.

[00:34:16]
Austin Lorte (Unrestricted): Like, I'm not even kidding you hundreds of times. So like, I'm, I'm like, I know how to overcome that objection really, really well.

[00:34:25]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): I think it, like, once you get settled here, if you'd be up for it, I'd love for you to, like, maybe drop in and look at what the team's doing for, like, sell-side sourcing. Because it sounds like you'd have a lot of, like, great ideas for us there.

[00:34:45]
Austin Lorte (Unrestricted): Yeah, I'm like, I want to run your business first. That's why, like, last week you're, like, asking me about pricing and I'm like, oh, I'm like, sure. I'm like, raise the price. That's my opinion, though. I'm like, you're not getting asked for payment plans. That means we should be charging. You know, so I'm like, I'm all for 70k up front. And if we're seeing resistance, like, okay, let's have that conversation. What would you do? You know, like, we're reasonable people, we've got to be able to cover our costs, you know, but we'll work with you to make it work, especially if we think you're going to close, you know, so I think that's it. I'm like, that's all I have on my side. But I'm like, some of it, we already talked about, like SBA regulations. The other one was like, maybe like, are you having buyers do QoE on every opportunity? Or is that up to their discretion?

[00:35:37]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): No, SBA does not require it. We guide people through a process to like, just sense check things before they get to the QoE, because that's going to be like a 15k investment. So usually the way it works is we'll get them to sign an LOI, then go out to several lenders. And get term sheets from lenders and then choose one to get a commitment letter from. Like the lenders will throw up a bunch of questions or problems before we even get to QoE. So that's a better way to like do a first pass before like firing off the QoE. Once we've got term sheets and the lenders are like happy with the deal, that's when I would like, okay, we sign one of the commitment letters with the lender. And alongside that are going to have them do a QoE because the lenders are only going to look at it from their risk. They're not going to do a QoE process. So they will often refer to it or, you know, be happy that it's done, but it's not required for most SBA deals to do a QoE.

[00:36:52]
Austin Lorte (Unrestricted): That makes sense.

[00:36:53]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): But I advise people that it's the best 15K you're ever going to spend, right? They're like, oh, I'm like serious. Like knowing that all the money that they said is there is actually there in that format, having like a good idea of your working capital, like how cash flow works. You're going to know the numbers better than the owner when you step in and up at business. And then following the QoE, that's when they should like start drafting the purchase agreement because, you know, they don't want to initiate all the lawyer fees pre-QoE because there might be things that come up that are absolute deal breakers, right? That they can't negotiate. We also work with them on like what to negotiate when. So like what most people are going to do is they're going to negotiate a point every time it comes up and create deal fatigue instead of like, like getting it all into one place. And there might be like one or two moments throughout that process where they're going to, they're going to need to negotiate like a bunch of things. And the way that we tell them to do it ends up being more collaborative and feeling less like scary for the owner. And as opposed to like, you know, what most first time buyers are going to do, this came up, we get to talk, you know, you know, and the owner's just like, oh my God, you know, like, and then it came up initially might not be that big of a deal when other things come up down the line. And then, so it's like, okay, let's prioritize like what's a like absolutely must change, what's nice to have, and what's a, you can give them a concession in order to get what you want kind of thing.

[00:38:32]
Austin Lorte (Unrestricted): That makes sense. Yeah, I think that's all I have on my side. I'm like, we can just walk through this call if you want.

[00:38:38]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Yeah, great. What's best to support you in this? Just play along?

[00:38:44]
Austin Lorte (Unrestricted): Yeah, just treat me. I'm like, the thing I'm going to do after this is talk to myself all day and go through your deck. That's the one I'm worried about. This one I think will be really, really easy. But we're about to find out how easy it's going to be. So, beautiful. Well, thanks for hopping on with me today, Athena. Really excited for our conversation. Obviously, had a chance to kind of go through the form that you submitted on your website. And yeah, again, really excited for our call today. Main purpose is I want to really dive into your experience, really what your skill sets are, and what transfers into a new organization, what sort of goals you have. And then finally, likely most important is your likelihood to move forward, right? I just want to make sure that this is a good fit. We don't have the bandwidth to work with everyone. So we really want to make sure that should you move forward, that you are going to see the results that you're looking for. So if that works okay for you, can kind of dive into things from here, Athena.

[00:39:40]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): That sounds great.

[00:39:42]
Austin Lorte (Unrestricted): Perfect. Well, my first question, I always love to understand. It's like, where'd you hear about us?

[00:39:47]
Austin Lorte (Unrestricted): Was it a podcast, just on LinkedIn, or how'd you find out about us?

[00:39:49]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Oh, I heard someone mention you on the Acquiring Minds podcast.

[00:39:56]
Austin Lorte (Unrestricted): Oh, nice. Yeah, Anon, he's an incredible, incredible. Cool story. So I'm glad you found your way to us. But I guess to kind of kick things off, have you guys, have you bought a business before, Athena? Is this kind of your first time really looking at one?

[00:40:11]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Or where are you at in your journey? Oh, I, in my, you know, career, I've been involved in acquisitions, but I've never bought one myself.

[00:40:21]
Austin Lorte (Unrestricted): Okay. Yeah, that's helpful. And it's always good to really just understand kind of like your background, where you came from. And I guess, like, why are you looking for a business?

[00:40:31]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Like, why do you want to buy a business, I'm just sick of taking orders from people. Like, I want to be able to go to my kids' recital without asking for permission. And like, I want to be able to make decisions.

[00:40:49]
Austin Lorte (Unrestricted): Yeah, makes sense. And what are you doing for work right now, Athena?

[00:40:53]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Um, I am a CMO at a tech company.

[00:40:59]
Austin Lorte (Unrestricted): I gotcha. So long hours, there's always too much to do and not enough time to do it, it sounds like. And you're like many others, right? They just, they want that freedom. It's not that they dislike what they do. It's really that they want the time to be able to spend with their kids or to spend with their families. How many kids do you have, by the way?

[00:41:19]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): I've got one.

[00:41:21]
Austin Lorte (Unrestricted): He's 17. Oh my goodness. That's an important time to be around for sure.

[00:41:25]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Are you married currently? No, we'll be soon. Oh, amazing.

[00:41:31]
Austin Lorte (Unrestricted): And what's your kid's name?

[00:41:33]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Jaden.

[00:41:35]
Austin Lorte (Unrestricted): Jaden. That's a great name. I love that. Well, guess, talk to me a little bit about your end goal with buying this business. Like, what are you hoping to accomplish? I know you mentioned, like, freedom of time. Is that really it? Is there anything else that you're really looking for in terms of an acquisition?

[00:41:53]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Well, I mean, I know I'm not going to get wealthy just having a W-2. to know wealthy, but not... So I'd like a business that creates generational wealth, and I'm looking at businesses like 500 to a million in SDE and want something that's been in existence for 20 years and has strong recurring revenue and a growth trend over the last couple of years.

[00:42:30]
Austin Lorte (Unrestricted): Yeah, that makes sense. So really looking to mitigate risk, it sounds like you want to buy something that's been around for some time, really long term and stable, you know? And I guess like talking 500K to a million in SDE, like, what are you after in terms of like, income after debt service? Like, what do you need to take home to make this worth your time and really risk hopping out of more of a W-2 position?

[00:42:57]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Well, I'm currently making like... $250,000 with my bonuses and everything as my total cost. So I'd want to release that, but ideally more long-term or over time because it's pretty comfortable right now.

[00:43:16]
Austin Lorte (Unrestricted): Yeah, that makes sense. You're comfortable with not getting rich. So really looking to, at a minimum, cover that $250,000 where you're at today and potentially with some upside. We buy past performance, not future opportunity. But you want something that fits your skill set and really what you're good at. So you do have that upside long-term. You have the ability to grow this business to new heights. Makes a ton of sense. And I guess, how soon are you looking to do this? Or maybe let me back up, Athena. Apologies there. How long have you been looking for a business? Have you just started this process? Have you looked at biz by sell? I mean, I guess talk to me a little bit about... where you're at in your journey and what you've done so far.

[00:44:04]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Yeah, I mean, I heard about it like last year and I read Buy Then Build and I've just been, you know, kind of looking at listings, I guess, maybe for like six months.

[00:44:16]
Austin Lorte (Unrestricted): Oh, nice. And any success so far? Have you talked to any brokers, gotten any SIMs? Like what's been your experience so far?

[00:44:26]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Well, I've like asked for information on a couple of businesses, but mostly just like looking at listings and like learning as much as I can. I have looked at a couple of SIMs, but they were bad SIMs.

[00:44:42]
Austin Lorte (Unrestricted): Yeah, that makes sense. Was it represented by a broker?

[00:44:47]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Yes.

[00:44:48]
Austin Lorte (Unrestricted): It's one of those situations where, especially as a first time buyer, Athena, like you really have to, to know what you're doing in terms of evaluating a business, right? You might be the perfect person to run that business. might might person to business. business. Thank But you may not be skilled in terms of buying businesses yet, right? And that's not your ultimate goal. Your goal is not to be a broker trading businesses or taking businesses from one market to another. Your goal is really to get into the weeds and grow that business long term and be the operator, you know? So I guess, like, talk to me about a timeline. Like, how soon would you like to acquire a business? Obviously, you've been at it for six months. Seems like you're in pretty good spirits compared to some of our other clients. But I guess talk to me about your goals in terms of a timeline.

[00:45:36]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Yeah, I'd like to have something, like, closed by the summer.

[00:45:40]
Austin Lorte (Unrestricted): Okay, beautiful. So we're in April now, two months. I guess, how did you come to that timeline or what's the trigger in the summer?

[00:45:50]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Um, well, I was just listening to, like, Cody Sanchez, and she made it sound like you could do this in three months.

[00:46:00]
Austin Lorte (Unrestricted): Oh, my goodness. They call us the dream killers here, Athena. the reason for it is there's just, there's so much information online, right? And it's all phenomenal. They're driving awareness around this, but it's like closing a house, right? It's like if you went out and found a home that you like tomorrow, it'd be at least 30 days before you were able to close on that, right? You've got a home inspection, things of that nature that you need to get through and make sure that you're not only de-risking this for yourself, Athena, but also de-risking this for the bank. And the same thing is true for a business, but it gets a bit more convoluted in the sense of like diving into their financial performance. Like, does this business meet my skills as well as my needs in terms of monetary goals? Um, and a whole lot of other things is the owner representing this correctly. Like, is this, um, going to, or are there any risks around customer concentration? How am I going to finance this? And then the whole underwriting process, um, with the bank, as well as like the legal. Out. Respect as well. I guess, have you put thought into how you're going to finance this business yet, Athena?

[00:47:07]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Yeah, I want to use SBA for it.

[00:47:12]
Austin Lorte (Unrestricted): Perfect. And then what are you working with in terms of investable assets today?

[00:47:18]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): I'd be willing to put like 200 cash into it. Perfect.

[00:47:23]
Austin Lorte (Unrestricted): Yeah, you're definitely in line, especially looking at that more down market, that 500K market, maybe up to 750, but a million bucks, you're probably talking a four to five million dollar business at a minimum. So if you are looking at the higher end of that SDE range, it's going to be a situation where you either need to pull from other assets, whether that's a hell lock or retirement accounts or things of that nature. Or if you're going to go out outside and really bring in investors to help you fund the project, I guess, talk to me about the next 90 day. And maybe let me back up for a second, Athena. I just want to shoot you straight. Acquiring a business in three months would be an absolute miracle. I won't say that it never happens, but very, very rarely. I've been doing this for quite a few years at this point, and I haven't seen somebody be able to accomplish that yet. So just to kind of manage your expectations, we're really looking at a 12-month time limit. Like, it's going to be 12 months before you're signing on the dotted line, and maybe even 18 before you're actually transitioning into business ownership. How does that sound to you?

[00:48:37]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Well, it's a lot longer than I thought it would be.

[00:48:41]
Austin Lorte (Unrestricted): Mm-hmm. And I guess, what are your concerns around that extended timeline, or are there concerns? Or is it more just like, hey, Austin, I've got to wrap my head around, like, I was thinking this is going to take three months, but realistically, it's going to take 12 to 18.

[00:48:57]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Yeah, maybe a bit of that. I just, I want to get out of this. John, I don't know if I can do another 12 to 18 months.

[00:49:05]
Austin Lorte (Unrestricted): The nice thing is, is 100% of our clients have been able to successfully get under LOI. So although it's a 12-month timeline, at the bare minimum, you're going to be able to see that light at the end of the tunnel, right? Where you're not in the mundane day-to-day grind, and you'll be able to allocate some of your free time to really finding success in the CERT process. And that maybe bridges to my next question for you, Athena. like, how much time on a weekly basis would you say you have to invest in a CERT?

[00:49:37]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Well, I'm spending like one to two hours a day after work right now, I think. And then a couple hours on the weekends, so maybe 15.

[00:49:47]
Austin Lorte (Unrestricted): Nice. Yeah, so that should be plenty. We ask for at least five up front, right, like as we're evaluating deals. And then once you find the right one, that's going to ramp up a bit. And typically that 10 to 15 hours a week that... it sounds like you're currently investing. I guess, talk to me about the next 90 days. I mean, obviously, we're hoping to have a business across the finish line in the next three months. But knowing that that's not realistic, what would you consider success or a win over the course of the next 90 days?

[00:50:21]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): I guess seeing businesses that I get excited about. I haven't really seen any yet.

[00:50:27]
Austin Lorte (Unrestricted): That makes sense. So if we could put some, well, I guess, first and foremost, if we could really refine your deal box, and maybe let's talk about what types of businesses are you looking for right now, Athena? Like you mentioned, $500K to $1 million in seller discretionary earnings. Do you have geographic restrictions, like a specific location that you're focused on? Have you put thought into the types of business? Are you looking for brick and mortar or something maybe a bit more remote like e-commerce? Maybe talk to me a little bit about your deal box, Athena.

[00:50:59]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Well, I live. I was in New Braunfels and I don't want to really have to commute. So, you know, something within 45 minutes of here. Like Austin, like up to Austin and down to San Antonio. And then industry-wise, like I'm still kind of figuring that out, but I know I don't want restaurants or franchises or retail.

[00:51:29]
Austin Lorte (Unrestricted): That makes sense. Do you have maybe a list of industries that you don't want to focus on?

[00:51:36]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): No, just like the ones that I just mentioned, like, you know, restaurants and retail and franchises for now. But no, I guess I don't have an actual list.

[00:51:52]
Austin Lorte (Unrestricted): Yeah. And one thing I'll say, especially like if you're going to confine the geographic area in which you're searching. Obviously, it limits the number of options, and as a result, kind of extends that timeline, right? If you said, Austin, I'm willing to move anywhere in the country tomorrow, maybe that three to six-month timeline is a bit more realistic. Especially if you're talking in a specific geographic region, we need to really ingrain ourselves with the brokers in that market, as well as identify some off-market opportunities that we think would be a fit for you. And as a result, it does extend that timeline a little bit, looking at about that 12 to 18 months, as I mentioned. And are you planning to operate this business, Athena? Are you planning to bring in a partner to run it for you?

[00:52:39]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Well, I mean, I'd like to eventually get an operator to run the business, but I'm willing to do it initially and get it off the ground and get it to a good place.

[00:52:55]
Austin Lorte (Unrestricted): So, and I guess, like, talk to me about a timeline around that transition. Like, what do you think? It would take you to get that to where you know the business intimately. It's in a good position where you feel comfortable kind of putting in an operator to really take your place.

[00:53:10]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Maybe six to 12 months.

[00:53:15]
Austin Lorte (Unrestricted): Talk to me about that six to 12 months. It just, it seems a little bit aggressive to me. Are you, like, so you envision, I guess, like, what do you envision needing to know prior to transitioning that to really a new operator in place? And I'm sure it's going to depend on the business a little bit, obviously. But, like, what are some of the things that you think about that, like, you need to know about that business or about that organization prior to really implementing an operator?

[00:53:48]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): I guess what the owner was doing before and kind of how the day-to-day runs, but, you know, I, I'm just. Like, been following people where, you know, it's like, this can be a semi-passive investment. You just take it over and, like, you know, learn how it goes and then get somebody in to run it every day.

[00:54:17]
Austin Lorte (Unrestricted): Like, and can and should are two very different things, Athena. And, like, you're a CMO, right? So, like, you're sitting in board meetings and, like, are aware of all the different faucets of the tech company that you're currently in. And, like, as you go down market and look at more mainstream style businesses, like, does that simplify? Absolutely. But, like, you still have an operations component. You've got the marketing component to fill the top of your funnel. Then you've got the sales component to actually convert those leads. And then, finally, delivery, right, where you're actually delivering those services. And coming into a new business, like, it would be like them at your tech company, them changing a CMO. No, every six to 12 months, right? It's like the employees that work there, that's naturally going to create fear and friction within that organization. And you create massive risk for yourself and not from a financial perspective, but more on the non-monetary side where at the end of the day, what's a business, right? It's a group of people directed toward the common goal, right? Without the people in that organization, like it becomes really hard to run that semi-passively as they say, right? So our recommendation is always like, get in there, get to know the people that you're working with, like sit in the operation seat, sit in the sales seat, sit in the delivery seat, right? Know that business intimately prior to making a transition to a new ownership. And that's going to do a couple of things for you, right? When things break, you know exactly how to fix them. But more importantly, I would say number two is you'll actually have the trust and buy-in from the employees that just went through a massive shift. Enjoy. So then the... In terms of a new owner coming in, and the fears, and really the things that stir up inside them more as individuals from an emotional perspective as opposed to a logical one. Does that make sense?

[00:56:12]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Yeah, yeah, I guess I hadn't thought of it that way.

[00:56:17]
Austin Lorte (Unrestricted): And I guess you mentioned you started this six months ago, but how long have you wanted to buy a business, or how long have you seen yourself as an entrepreneur? I mean, if you're a CMO at an early-stage tech company, my guess is maybe you found out about ETA six months ago, but you probably wanted to be a business owner for longer than that, I would assume.

[00:56:37]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Yeah, I mean, I started quite a few businesses when I was a kid, but I just watched my parents struggle so much that I went into what I thought was more stability, but I hated taking orders from everybody my whole career.

[00:56:55]
Austin Lorte (Unrestricted): Stability is always kind of a funny word to Athena, right? It's like when you look at it. A W-2 position. It's like, you have one customer. One. And that's your employer, right? So if they decide that they want to go a different direction tomorrow, do you have a phenomenal resume? Absolutely, right? But you're back on the market looking for a role. And the fact of the matter is, sub-5% of startups ever get venture funding. And the number that actually make it past five years is absolutely atrocious. So especially working in that startup landscape, like there's a tremendous amount of risk as a W-2 position as well. You know, and really entrepreneurship through acquisition or ETA really helps you mitigate that, right? It allows you to apply the skills that you built over your entire career to a new organization, but one that you actually own, right? And so that gives me a pretty good understanding of what you're looking for. It sounds like you have experience at least like running teams from a marketing perspective. Thank you. Have you worn any other hats in the C-suite as well, Athena, or like any other like management or like directed business experience in the past?

[00:58:11]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): But I helped my parents with their company a bit, but yeah, I've always just kind of managed teams and companies. So I looked after brand. I've, you know, done some operations, but mostly marketing.

[00:58:27]
Austin Lorte (Unrestricted): Mostly marketing. The operations side is super interesting. And I'm curious, what do your parents do?

[00:58:33]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): They ran a construction management company.

[00:58:36]
Austin Lorte (Unrestricted): That's a tough business. Tough business with low margins. Do they do a lot of like subbing out or do they mainly like is it vertically integrated and they're doing everything in-house?

[00:58:48]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): They, they ended up starting a construction company and that, that was doing really well because they, they found really good people, but you know, they're, they're tired. They've been doing it a long time.

[00:59:00]
Austin Lorte (Unrestricted): Time.

[00:59:03]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Shut it down, you know?

[00:59:05]
Austin Lorte (Unrestricted): Oh man, I'm sorry to hear that. It's probably what we were just talking about in the sense of like, it's at the end of the day, like running a business is simple, but it's not easy, right? It's like that who, not how. It's like having the right people in the right seats to help you go out and execute. And that can be an extremely heavy lift, you know? And the benefit of buying an existing business that's been around is like, people are already in place. It's about building those relationships and building that trust and really having a vision long-term that you can all rally behind and kind of move forward. I guess you mentioned seeing the right opportunity. It's like, outside of that, like, what do you think has been the biggest challenge in terms of like getting started? Yeah, think it's time.

[00:59:57]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Like, I don't feel like I have a lot of time to... like, go through the listings and, you know, brokers aren't getting back to me. So I feel like, you know, just not enough deal flow.

[01:00:10]
Austin Lorte (Unrestricted): Yeah, it's crazy these days. It's just more buyers than sellers, despite what the internet might tell you, right? As these brokers are being inundated with people like yourself reaching out. And they come from a different generation, more of an old school pen and paper kind of workflows, you know? Like, having a Google Calendar, the ability to, like, send an email or manage a pipeline on their phone, it's just, like, not something that they're real familiar with. So with this recent boom, they're just absolutely drowning. And, I mean, people have mixed opinions about brokers, I think, for the most part. They're doing the best they can. They're pretty good. But we have someone on our team, their full-time job is literally to chase after brokers and actually get that information and have those conversations. But we're oftentimes sending them an email. Reaching out on LinkedIn, sending them a text message if they actually read it, picking up the phone and calling them, you know. So it can definitely be a process just to get that information without even evaluating the business, you know. And I guess, like, what's stopped you from moving forward? Is it just really not finding qualified opportunities? Like, if I put a deal in front of you tomorrow that was $500K in a service-based business that needed help with marketing, like, would you pull the trigger on that right away? Or what's been stopping you from moving forward, I suppose?

[01:01:35]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): I think so, as long as I was interested in it, you know. I just haven't seen anything really interesting, so.

[01:01:43]
Austin Lorte (Unrestricted): What is interesting?

[01:01:48]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Just, I don't know, like, I just, I'm not getting excited about any of the businesses that I'm looking at. I don't see how I fit into them, you know.

[01:01:57]
Austin Lorte (Unrestricted): Yeah. So, like, really saying, like, how you can, is it more like... The industries are boring. You couldn't see yourself waking up and doing that for 40 hours a week. And oftentimes more, especially as you initially transition into that business, where it's more like I'm not finding businesses that meet my skill set where I can actually add value.

[01:02:18]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Yeah, I think maybe the latter. I'm just not seeing how I can fit into it and run the business. But also, I'm not really sure what would be interesting. I don't know if I've looked at enough things yet to figure that out.

[01:02:38]
Austin Lorte (Unrestricted): Yeah, that makes sense. And a lot of what we do is I can put to the letter of the law what's in your deal box in front of you. But until you actually dig into those and start evaluating transactions, to your point, you really don't know how you fit in as the chief executive at one of those organizations. You know, we... I find that really evaluating what on paper is a good fit opportunity is a great way to better understand the types of businesses that you're looking for. And it sounds like you've done this more or less on your own, Athena. Have you reached out to somebody else for help? Are you in any networking groups or things of that nature? mainly just kind of got the bug via social media and kind of dug into this on your own?

[01:03:25]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Yeah, I'm doing it by myself. I mean, I've read the Buy Then Build book, and I'm in a WhatsApp group where people talk a bit, and I go to the local, like, Austin meetup. But, you know, yeah, I'm basically doing it by myself.

[01:03:44]
Austin Lorte (Unrestricted): Walker's incredible with Buy Then Build. I mean, he's been doing this for a couple decades, right, before ETA was probably even taught at Harvard, to be honest with you. But, and then just slowly but surely, it seems like in the past couple years, a lot of this information that was... ... ... Fathom the upper echelons of society has really made its way out to the general public. So I think it's largely a good thing. But to your point, there's a lot of question marks. I mean, what do you feel like you don't know? I mean, I know that's a hard question, Athena, because we don't know what we don't know. But what do you feel like your gaps are when it comes to finding a business and furthermore, evaluating it so once you take over, you do find success?

[01:04:30]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Yeah, I guess, like, how to find more businesses. I don't feel like I'm seeing enough right now. And maybe, like, the, like, modeling, like, you know, how to structure it for SBA. You know, I come from, like, you know, private equity experience and seeing that, you know, so I think I know how to look at deals, like, and model them. But, like, I know. SBA has some restrictions.

[01:05:03]
Austin Lorte (Unrestricted): So it sounds like you're fairly equipped from a financial modeling perspective, like really need help putting together more or less a credit packet for the bank, right? Something that's going to get them excited and really not create additional friction in that process. The second is like obviously deal flow, right? It's like especially if you're only doing this for 10 hours a week and you're just scrolling kind of the major websites out there, BizBuySell and the others, BizQuest. I think Cody Sanchez has a new one called DealScout as well. But really like getting in front of the right opportunities, right? And that's not an easy thing to do, like getting your reps in. Like we have over 100 different sources that we're actually pulling from. And we're looking at hundreds of deals to deliver you maybe two to four on a monthly basis that actually meet your specific criteria. But we have a team and their full-time job is going out and hunting opportunities on your behalf. So I'm doing. I'm... This is an individual I can imagine is a heavy lift, not to mention a 17-year-old son, you know, I'm he's involved in one. I guess let me ask, what does your son like to do for fun?

[01:06:11]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Like, what sort of extracurricular activities does he do? I love Jiu-Jitsu.

[01:06:17]
Austin Lorte (Unrestricted): Oh, fun. I'm like, I love Jiu-Jitsu. It's super, super, super interesting. A lot of people just, like, think of those guys as, like, dumb meatheads, you know, but it's, like, it's really, it's like a very engaging sport. It takes a lot of, like, mental know-how as well as a lot of physical well-being. So do you go to his matches and stuff? Is that fairly common? Or does he just train every single day like a lot of them do?

[01:06:40]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): I know it's... Yeah, a lot of trainings. He hasn't had any competitions yet, but we go to his trainings.

[01:06:47]
Austin Lorte (Unrestricted): Soon, soon, I am sure. Well, that's exciting. Well, I'm trying to think of anything else to ask you. I guess maybe the last question on my side, Athena, is, like, have you gone out? Well, and... been pre-approved with a lender yet?

[01:07:05]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): I got a letter of support from Live Oak Bank.

[01:07:10]
Austin Lorte (Unrestricted): Oh, nice. What was the letter for? I guess more specifically. Did they give you a specific dollar amount on that?

[01:07:19]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): No, they just said that they would support me.

[01:07:22]
Austin Lorte (Unrestricted): There wasn't a dollar amount on it. Yeah, that makes sense. So in order to go shopping, we've got to have money. So one of the first things we'll do once we get you into the program is actually go out and secure an approval letter. But based on our conversation today, it sounds like you're a pretty good fit based on what we're doing. Typically what I do from here, Athena, is bring this back to the team. Again, we obviously have a long wait list, a lot of folks that want to work with us. But we need to be really, really mindful about the types of individuals that we bring in. Right. Right. Right. So I want to present this to our committee, really understand, hey, are we working with anyone in your market? Do we feel like based off your deal box, or at least what it looks like today, that we're going to be able to actually go out and find success for you? And then from there, can do a much deeper dive into the program and things of that nature, exactly how it works. But I guess one concern I'd have, Athena, and I guess twofold. One is, are you comfortable waiting 12 months? Knowing that it's going to take 12 months to go out and find a business, does that scare you? Or is it really like, I just need a light at the end of that tunnel to know that, like, I'm not going to work this W-2 job for the next 10 years of my life, right? And not go out and build that generational wealth for my family. Like, are you comfortable with that 12-month timeline?

[01:08:53]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): I think if I was seeing deals I was excited about, then, you know, I don't... I don't to do this the right way, but it's 12 months of not seeing anything good. I don't think I'd feel good about that.

[01:09:09]
Austin Lorte (Unrestricted): I wouldn't feel good about that either, Athena. If I wasn't putting qualified deals in front of you in your first month, I wouldn't feel good about that either. And maybe to follow that up, if I put two to four deals that have already been qualified, we know they meet your deal box. We've already had a conversation with the broker. We've been able to gather the investment memorandum or the SIM. Is that enough volume for you to stay focused on this path? Because it is going to take 12 months. If I could show you two to four on a monthly basis that are specific to you that I know you'll love, and again, there's going to be that bit of a calibration period as you're evaluating opportunities, understanding what types of businesses your skill set best matches, but is two to four on a monthly basis enough volume for you to keep it?

[01:10:02]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): It sounds like not that much.

[01:10:07]
Austin Lorte (Unrestricted): What do you mean by not that much?

[01:10:11]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Well, I guess that, you know, two to four, I was expecting it to be like 30 or something.

[01:10:22]
Austin Lorte (Unrestricted): And I guess like in the past six months, how many deals do you think you looked at?

[01:10:30]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Um, listings, maybe like thousands.

[01:10:34]
Austin Lorte (Unrestricted): And how many have you actually talked to?

[01:10:38]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Like actually spoken to the broker?

[01:10:41]
Austin Lorte (Unrestricted): Mm-hmm.

[01:10:43]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Um, maybe three to four.

[01:10:46]
Austin Lorte (Unrestricted): Okay. And have you seen more than three or four investments in randoms as well? Or is it mainly just been those broker conversations?

[01:10:56]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Um, yeah, I got, I got maybe like... six sims. Yeah.

[01:11:06]
Austin Lorte (Unrestricted): And then post that broker conversation, the three or four that you've had, like how many of those were you actually interested? Like met your buy box, were a viable candidate for an acquisition? Something that you could see yourself run?

[01:11:20]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Maybe one, but it went under offer before we got to keep talking much.

[01:11:26]
Austin Lorte (Unrestricted): Mm-hmm. So four total that you actually spoke with the broker on, right? And that's over a six-month timeline. So like if you wanted someone to, and this is an us by the way, right? And like if you wanted somebody to load your calendar with a bunch more work, right? Like evaluating 30 deals on a monthly basis from a bandwidth perspective, like you're talking, and let's say it takes you an hour each, it'll take more, right? Like probably more like two to four, but let's call it an... you're talking 30 additional hours on a monthly basis divided by four. You're in that 10-hour-a-month or a 10-hour-a-week range that you're doing right now, but that doesn't allow you to evaluate any other opportunities. So if you find 30 that you like and you dive into due diligence with them, or not diligence in the traditional sense, but you do at least a surface-level evaluation, that's going to take so much time from your day that you're almost going to drown in opportunity, if that makes sense. So the idea here is, I don't want to flood you with unnecessary work, Athena. I want to make sure the two to four that I give you on a monthly basis, there's a strong chance that a lot of our clients are making offers on the first deals that we put in front of them because they've already been evaluated. So I want to put two to four heavily qualified deals where it's, hey, this is something you're extremely, call it 80% plus, likely to move forward on. As opposed to drowning in work on the other side. Does that make sense?

[01:13:05]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Yeah, yeah. Thanks for explaining that.

[01:13:07]
Austin Lorte (Unrestricted): That makes a lot more sense. So the two to four probably sounds a little better now.

[01:13:12]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Yeah. You know, if they're ones I get excited about, then yeah, that would be great.

[01:13:20]
Austin Lorte (Unrestricted): Absolutely. And I want to taper expectations here a little bit, Athena, right? Because like, your deal box is a theory. And it sounds like you have a pretty good idea on the types of organizations that you're looking for. like, there is going to be that calibration period. It could make sense from an economics and monetary perspective, and even a skill set perspective. But like, if you can't see yourself waking up and working at that business every day, like, it's not something you're going to be happy with. Like, you're trading one master for another, right? The master being your W2 position, to the other master being like, a business that like, hey, it makes good money. But like, I don't love when I'm... Right. I think one thing that's often left out when you're looking at a buy box is like, what, what excites you? What's going to get you up in the morning and, and really make you want to do this because like, is there a risk? Yeah. You know, but like, they're pretty, these are pretty stable assets, right? It's like, it's been around for a long time. Like it's produced consistent cashflow, but like at the end of the day, like things will get hard. Like this is business. Like you're not going out and talk to real estate investors, right? Like go talk to people that do fix and flips or do rental properties. And they'll all tell you like, that's not a passive investment. And business buying, like takes that to a whole other level. Like you're committing to the next 10 years at a minimum, right? And not necessarily like, we'll gladly help you sell it if you decide that like, Hey, this isn't, this isn't something that makes sense for me. But like, realistically, you want to be able to see yourself for a minimum of the next 10 years investing in actually building this. And like, that takes time and takes a really specific opportunity that like, gets you excited. So I want to taper expectations a little bit, but like, we'll do our best. But like, some of that's going to come from you and really understanding like, what makes the most sense for Athena? What's going to make Athena happy? So any anything else you feel like I should know? From our conversation today?

[01:15:29]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Um, no, I don't. I don't think so. I kind of told you everything I was looking for.

[01:15:35]
Austin Lorte (Unrestricted): Beautiful. Well, typically, what I do from here, I'll give you a bit of context, at least a high level in terms of what we do. And then if it sounds like something that piques your interest or that you'd like to pursue further. And again, like the two things I want to harp on is, it's going to take 12 months. And like, you need to be committed to this process. Right? the end of the day, like, we want to work with people that actually want to be business owners. A lot of people... will glorify this idea, but, like, when it comes time to put pen to paper and actually move forward with it, people do crazy things. But if it's something that it sounds like you're interested in, I'll bring this to our committee. We'll schedule a meeting maybe a little later on this week, tomorrow, Wednesday, depending on your schedule. And I can walk you through in a bit more detail their feedback as well as exactly what we do. But, yeah, how's all that sounding so far, I guess, on your side, Athena?

[01:16:29]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Yeah, good.

[01:16:31]
Austin Lorte (Unrestricted): Perfect. So what we do at AcquiMatch is really we're a search and match firm, right? And what that means is, like, our job is to go out and find you that perfect business. Like, doing this as an individual, like, I'll give you an example. There's fresh MBA students that will go raise millions of dollars in capital. They'll have a team around them, and they plan for this process to take two years, right? So our goal is to really provide you that support and that advisory that you get. With a lot of these larger, more institutional organizations, but to you as an individual, right? So that's number one. We want to go out and actually find businesses and opportunities that need your deal box as well as your personal goals. And that's not always monetary, right? And we don't just send listings. We're actually going to dig in, qualify these opportunities, and make sure that, hey, this is a highly attractive asset. And then it's just a matter of like, does this make sense for Athena, right? It's going to make sense from a financial and monetary perspective, but that doesn't necessarily mean that that's the right business for you as well as your skill set and goals. So that's really what we do. We'll go out, we'll find on-market opportunities. We're reaching out to brokers, understanding what sort of deals are in their pipeline. Because if you're looking at BizBuySell or some of these other platforms, those are the deals that didn't get sold transparently, Athena. like, they're the ones, it's kind of that list it and forget it. Mindset where they just throw it up and then they hope and pray that someone's going to come in. So we're going to go out and find these deals before they make it to those websites. We're going to evaluate those transactions as well as start reaching out to some off-market opportunities as well. Identifying, and this is maybe going to happen a little later as we better understand the types of organizations that you're looking at. But we want to bring in some proprietary deals that no one else is seeing as well. And then once it comes time, we'll help you put together an LOI, submit that, and then we'll help you through that entire negotiation as well as due diligence process, providing the tools that you need to be successful and ultimately move into business ownership in 12 to 18 months from now. So how's all that sound to you, Athena?

[01:18:47]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Yeah, that sounds great.

[01:18:50]
Austin Lorte (Unrestricted): Beautiful. Well, if it's something that makes sense, and again, the two things I want to harp on is it's going to take 12 months. And you need to be committed to this process. But if all of that makes sense to you. Thank you. I'd love to schedule a meeting maybe tomorrow afternoon to discuss, again, the feedback from our team, as well as what that process looks like a bit more granularly.

[01:19:11]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Great. That sounds great.

[01:19:13]
Austin Lorte (Unrestricted): Perfect. Okay. It was okay.

[01:19:18]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): I think you did great, you know, considering, like, you've just been watching it for a week. So, I mean, I would be comfortable putting you on now. I know if just have some, like, refinement points and things that I would point out to you maybe and just see how you feel about adding those in. But I think you did awesome.

[01:19:41]
Austin Lorte (Unrestricted): Yeah, I'm like, throw me your refinement points.

[01:19:44]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Let me, one second. I need to clean my, I've got one of these remarkable cards.

[01:19:50]
Austin Lorte (Unrestricted): I'm like, give me 30 seconds, too.

[01:19:52]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Okay. don't, don't, think, like that. I'm like, do you think you. Sorry, made a run for it, too.

[01:21:23]
Austin Lorte (Unrestricted): You're good, don't worry.

[01:21:25]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Okay, so, oh gosh, it's still not working, come on.

[01:21:37]
Austin Lorte (Unrestricted): My structure, my questions need to be a little bit more structured in a sense of like, who are you, why do you want to buy a business, and then dive into like acquisition specifics and then doubt and solutions. So my questions were kind of scattered, and then my elevator pitch, I didn't do a great job of gathering tie-downs throughout that process, like I did okay. Okay. Um, and then my elevator pitch could have been better.

[01:22:05]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Um, yeah, I think that's all fair to say. Okay, let me restart it and see if I can get to the top of it. So let me see if I can remember at the beginning. Um, a lot of people are getting on the call wanting to know how much it costs. So that's why in the beginning I say like, you know, on this call, I'm going to figure out if you're going to fit. And we're not going to talk about costs today, right? To just cover that off. Because then if like when I wasn't covering that off, people would ask at the end of the call. So if you don't want to bring that up, then just know it's coming. Well, I just want to know how much this costs, right? Um, so that's why at the beginning, I'll be like, hey, you know, like I need to figure out if you're a fit for services. Um, might be, I like the whole committee thing and everything, so I don't know if it's worth saying that, like, at the beginning, like, I'm going to gather some information, I'm going to go back and talk to the team, uh, just to, like, preface that in their head. And then also the important thing that I always say is, like, hey, I'm recording these calls for note-taking purposes, just get their buy-in there. Um, so, and it's, it's another just yes, you know, moment, too, so, um.

[01:23:28]
Austin Lorte (Unrestricted): counting yeses.

[01:23:30]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Yeah, okay, so, um, spending at front costs, what did I talk about that? Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, that, that was the point I just made, okay, um, so oftentimes when you say, why do you want to buy a business, people, like, go into the 500 to 700 SD, blah, blah, blah, they'll start going through their deal box, and then I'm like, okay, that's great, but, like, what's the actual why? You know, like, what is this going to, how is this going to change your life? And just get more of that emotional, like, there's emotional reasons behind it, which you can use later. And then you'll see in the summary, Paul, it's like, you're disillusioned with your workplace, you can't spend time with your kids. So I kind of said some of that stuff, but sometimes you need to pull it out of them because they're so in like, my deal box was this, right? And everybody's deal box is exactly the same. They all have the exact same criteria and they're not the same person. So like, that's something you can use to like pull out, right? So, and then another thing is like, when they say they see bad sims or like the deals are bad, I'm like, well, you just don't know how to, I don't say this to them, but like, they don't know how to evaluate deals, right? And brokers are not marketers. And oftentimes those hidden gems can be like, like found by actually going through the process. But most people see something they perceive as, like, a bad deal or a bad sin or a bad broker, and they just eliminate it. So they eliminate a bunch of stuff before it would be good. And then, what's that?

[01:25:14]
Austin Lorte (Unrestricted): I said before actually having a conversation.

[01:25:16]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Oh, yeah. And also, if somebody says that they have investment experience, like, that's a big, like, you got to re-educate them, right? Because it's, like, the way things go at, like, private equity level is not how they go in small business. So things that you would normally, like, perceive as a deal killer at the private equity size is not. It's just normal in small business. They're all, like, financials. And, like, so tell me you haven't run a small business without telling me you haven't run a small business, right? So when I know that there's, like, no exposure or understanding of small businesses, that, to me, is, like, perceived risk. So I'm probably not as good as bringing that up as you could be, but it's, like, hey, you've never worked in a small business. And you're bringing criteria from like big business into small business. We're going to have to like reteach you how things work because you're going to be eliminating things that are normal. And you're going to be looking for a really long time because you're looking and assessing against criteria for like large businesses rather than small ones. And then also like the bad sim thing. It's just like, yeah, they're all bad. Brokers are awful. I mean, they're not awful, but they're just not good at marketing. They're not good at like putting together like documents where they put together like somehow it's a one page document. Some it's like a 67 page, you know, market analysis. So you have to know how to like review that and like pull out the ones that are worth talking to. And because we have a whole team, like we'll schedule calls, whereas somebody might not have done it because they just don't have the bandwidth to do that. And it's on the calls that we discover like, oh, there's something here, right? I love the dream killers point. That was awesome.

[01:27:04]
Austin Lorte (Unrestricted): I really, oh my God, I can't spell your name, the dream killer.

[01:27:12]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): I love it. Yeah, I mean, you know, like that to me is like showing that we have integrity and that we're not just here to sell on something. And like, it's genuine. Like, I don't want to put someone into, I don't want to sell someone, you know, a dream because I was in a community that did that. Like, Cody's community was just like, yeah, you can do this in three months. And it's totally unrealistic. So, oh my gosh, this thing is frozen. Again, this is so frustrating. Let's see if I can get it open.

[01:27:44]
Austin Lorte (Unrestricted): You're good. And I'm like, we're at time, Athena, and I know you have to jump.

[01:27:48]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Let me just pull it up on my computer real quick because I have the app. So that will probably be a bit easier because there's a few points while it's fresh I wanted to make.

[01:27:59]
Austin Lorte (Unrestricted): And leave.

Austin Lorte (Unrestricted): And I heard you talk about this on another call as well, but you're just talking about like self-directed IRA and making an investment into the business.

[01:29:46]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Say that one more time.

[01:29:48]
Austin Lorte (Unrestricted): For 401ks, you're talking about like making it self-directed and then making a direct investment into the business, correct?

[01:29:54]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Yeah, it's called a Rob strategy. So it's, it's not like self-directed. It's like... this actual process that you have to go through, it's called Rollover Business Something. It's called a ROBS. We have a ROBS provider that's great at this, but basically you can take 401k funds, not IRA, so it has to be 401k, and you create an entity that then invests into the business and it becomes a shareholder of your business. But I don't give people the specifics because it's like, this is one of our tools and our toolkit to help them do it. So I'm just like, you can use your 401k to invest in your own business and it does not count as a taxable event. So do you have 401k? Do you have a HELOC? Now, SBA just cleaned up the documentation on HELOCs that they have to have an independent source to pay off that HELOC if they're going to use that money. So that independent source could be rental income, it can be a spouse's income, but it can't... it can't just be like their own income that pays off that HELOC. So most people that we've talked to have a spouse that also has income there. But it's like, do you have equity in your home? You know, because we can potentially use a HELOC there to get some more cash also. But it's just good for us to understand what their full financial situation is.

[01:31:24]
Austin Lorte (Unrestricted): Cool. That's good. Noted.

[01:31:32]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): And then, okay, let's see. It looks like it's, there we are. Also, on the search, so something that you didn't quite dig into, but I think is really important about the way that we operate, is spending a lot of time with them, figuring out what they're good at, what their vision is, what their goals are, what their skills are, like that. Yeah, we do. That before we even start the search, and it's like a 30 to 60 day process. But like, you know, that whole, your criteria is probably the exact same as everybody else, and you are not the exact same as everybody else. So we're going to look at businesses that you will be a good fit for. When we're looking at those businesses, we're thinking about will you fit into this? So just getting a little bit more under the skin and like, the vision. So that's why I asked like the non-monetary goals, like what is a business going to allow you to achieve? And just like really getting them to like lock into what is like life as a business owner look like for them. The investment parameters, you need to ask separately, because they're important points, like industry, not so much, but geography. Like, because you kind of tell me your geography industry, like you rattled off a lot all at once. And actually, they're intentionally to be separate because they're important points. So if they only want to go within 45 minutes of their house, that's a discussion where it's like, okay, that kind of geography can take even longer because you're super geo-restricted. And if you are open to other places under certain conditions, then that might widen. So then it's a discussion like, have you ever thought of relocating or would you be open to going to a place a couple times a month or once a week or whatever, but just digging into the geo more. Um, and then, um, industry is like the watch out there is if they only want one industry, like we can't work that way, you know? So like, if they're only like, I only want manufacturing businesses, then they're not going to be a fit for us because our model doesn't work for that.

[01:33:56]
Austin Lorte (Unrestricted): Yeah, perfect.

[01:33:58]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Cool. Um, I love that. How long have you seen yourself as an entrepreneur? That was great because some people just found out about this like a couple months ago, but like getting them thinking, the timing of that is getting them thinking again, like how long this has been going on. Um, BizScout sucks. Just letting you know. I was an early user of it and like the things that she's doing. I'm just like, you're crazy. Um, we sift through thousands of businesses a month for people. You said hundreds. So just a small point there. Um, the letter of support, just, you can, you can, if they say, sorry, I just, I didn't know what that meant. I'm like, exactly. Yeah. I think you did good. Right. So that's, that's just a point for me to teach you. So, um, Live Oak gets hit up like all the time. People that are like, I'm trying to buy a business. And they're like, okay, here's a letter of support. But we have people that will give like an actual, they'll look at their personal financial statements, they'll look at their background, they'll have a conversation with them, and they will give them a letter that puts an amount that they would be willing to, like, lend to them under the right circumstances. So Contact at Live Oak does that with every single one of our clients. But a lot of people just end up getting a letter of support because the bank's like, whatever, here you go, you know, like, and it means nothing. It doesn't get you in the door with the brokers. Um, I love the tenure commitment thing. I think that was awesome. Um, yeah, and then I just put a note, personal goals and defining that toolbox is really important point just of how we're a little bit different than just like, you know, putting businesses in front of people. Um, the biz by so we use biz by sell. When you say businesses that are on BizBuySell, we use all of them. We don't just have non-listed sources, so I just don't want to plant the wrong thing in people's minds there. It's like we will get oftentimes brokers that will send us things before it goes to those listings, but we have a team that scans and scrapes hundreds of different sources, including BizBuySell.

[01:36:26]
Austin Lorte (Unrestricted): Do you know the term undue emphasis?

[01:36:31]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): No.

[01:36:32]
Austin Lorte (Unrestricted): That's like a concept in selling. There's a couple things that I like undue emphasis. It's just like, hey, it's important to mention these, but you don't need to go and emphasize that specific point. Talking about where we're sourcing deals from is like, I should have been lighter on where they're sourcing deals, and I shouldn't have been as specific as where we're sourcing deals. So I think that that was like a place there was like some undue emphasis where like, I am... Besides those things too much to the point where it almost would have created an objection. So I agree.

[01:37:05]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Yeah. Or an unrealistic expectation that we're only getting private broker listings.

[01:37:12]
Austin Lorte (Unrestricted): Right.

[01:37:13]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Yeah. Cool.

[01:37:14]
Austin Lorte (Unrestricted): 100%. 100%.

[01:37:16]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Okay. And then another thing that you'll learn this as you get into it more, but how put a financial offer together. A lot of people don't. They just do the basic structure. And then if they can't make it competitive and it doesn't meet SBA requirements, debt service coverage ratio isn't good. So it's not just about getting an LOI together. It's like, what's the financial structure behind that offer? And so I always kind of describe it as like door number two and door number three. Like you think your biggest problem is deal flow, but what are you going to do when you find that deal? You know, like you don't know what's coming next and you can't be learning. You're in a competitive situation. So door number two is like how to actually win that deal. And door number three is how to actually close on it. Because like 20 to 50% of deals that fall apart after a signed LOI are because the buyer didn't know what they were doing. So people think they're like, yeah, yeah, they just have this overinflated confidence. So they haven't even thought that far because they haven't found a deal. Or they're like, yeah, I like submitted LOIs, but I didn't win it, you know, or like somebody else came in all cash or like, you know, didn't get your back or whatever. And I'm like, you didn't structure it properly and you probably didn't negotiate it properly or you didn't get in there earlier enough. Like you can't just blame other circumstances. Or they didn't think you were a serious buyer. They could, you know, get it done or whatever. So there's all these variables that might be like behind the scenes on why they're not getting it. You know, and we'll, we'll like, we push our clients to get... feedback, like, if they lost it, right? Or we'll even go back to the program and be like, what happened there? So that's all good as a starting point. So that was all the, but I mean, like I said, if you were to run that tomorrow that way, I would be ridiculously happy with it.
ACTION ITEM: Prepare for tomorrow's practice call w/ Athena
- WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/286321237?timestamp=5950.9999
I think you've grasped everything really quickly.

[01:39:20]
Austin Lorte (Unrestricted): More or less. I'm like, by the end of today, but if we do this tomorrow again, which we should, that'll be it. Much more better.

[01:39:32]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): We'll do this again tomorrow morning, and then we'll also go through her deal record and just see what she's been, like, texting. It's a woman that saw me do my, like, lecture at UT, so I'm like, is she actually buying or, like, what? Like, it's a weird one because I'm like, does she actually want to buy or is she just, like, getting in touch?
ACTION ITEM: Clean up HubSpot pipeline, add notes on deals past form stage
- WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/286321237?timestamp=5995.9999
Because she was like, I saw you talk. I want to talk, you know? But we'll see. And then I... I still owe you a cleaned-up pipeline.

[01:40:03]
Austin Lorte (Unrestricted): I don't even have access to HubSpot yet. No, it's because I've needed to clean up the pipeline. Oh, yeah. I'm like, that's how you do it. I'm not worried about it at all.

[01:40:15]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Great. It's not unclean. I just need to make sure I add notes and stuff. But there's still two pipeline stages that you'll be able to start diving into immediately, which is they qualified based on the criteria, and they didn't book.
ACTION ITEM: Set up Austin's scheduling link + Zoom account
- WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/286321237?timestamp=6028.9999
Or they didn't qualify, and they weren't given the option to book. They were just told they were on a wait list. So you can reach out to all of them, give them a link, and that sort of thing. So I think Aka's going to schedule some time with you to get your link set up, make sure you have Zoom, and that sort of thing. So you can just start running calls next week. We can open up your schedule, and you can start reaching out to all those folks this week. So we'll get access either today or tomorrow with the latest. So I'll tell her, go ahead, and then just.
ACTION ITEM: Practice & refine sales script + deck presentation all day
- WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/286321237?timestamp=6061.9999
Just don't pay attention to anything past the form stage. I'll make sure that I update notes and everything on where those are at later today.

[01:41:09]
Austin Lorte (Unrestricted): Yeah, yeah. That's perfect. That's perfect. I'm good on my side. I'm just like literally my plan is to like role play this script and then more importantly the deck again and again and again and again all day long. So that's like I have a wide open calendar, but that's like that's what I'm doing all day long. So I've got plenty of stuff to do just to get that a little bit more fluid and structured because like I don't love the way that that calls look.

[01:41:37]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Well, I think for your first one, it was awesome. So I like that you hold yourself to standards, but I think you're doing fantastic. And yeah, any questions in the meantime, let us know. But Anka should be in touch if she hasn't already to schedule some time to go through.

[01:41:54]
Austin Lorte (Unrestricted): We've got time all week and then maybe tomorrow we'll talk. Objections and your thoughts on like my. Yeah, I think for the most part they're pretty spot on.

[01:42:05]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): There's probably just a nuance that I can give you behind some of those or like context on like where I think those objections are coming from. Yeah. I love it. Sweet. Have a great day. Thanks, you too. Bye. Bye. Bye.
