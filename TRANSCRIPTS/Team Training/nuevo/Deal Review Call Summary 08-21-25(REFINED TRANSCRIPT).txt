[00:00:32]
Anke Jordaan: Sorry, we're a bit like me, Athena ran over a call, and she'll be running with us. I'm excited for the first write-up calls tomorrow, Cash. Are you excited?

[00:00:45]
Ryan Cash: Yeah, I mean, just scrambling to get NDAs, actually, for those deals. But, like, barring I actually get NDAs, like, it should be pretty good. Yeah, we'll see. Yeah, one of them I was actually going bring up on this call because I had to call the broker to get the NDA sent to the client. And on that call, the broker told me this deal now has two IOIs and two LOIs and we're closing bids on Monday. So, yeah, Michael's, the power line machinery show. Yeah.

[00:01:58]
Athena Simpson: What's your plan, Cash?

[00:02:00]
Ryan Cash: Well, I think it's like there's a lot more utility in this call on like the life cycle of the customer in general and getting them updated on like our process and making sure that they understand the NDAs and what our write-ups look like. So I think it's important for us to have this call because we're going to need to have it regardless, right? That said, I don't know. Obviously, I want Michael to look at the write-up and get familiar with our write-up process. That said, I don't really see a world where – because Michael's not even going to – I guess he's going to get the write-up after that call that said, you know, obviously like three days until a deadline. It's going to be pretty crazy for – First deal. So I definitely wanted to bring that up in here and see what best way to communicate to Michael is on this situation.
ACTION ITEM: Inform Michael about broker's update on deal (2 IOIs, 2 LOIs, Monday deadline). Explain NDA process, write-up process, and manage expectations for first deal review call.

[00:03:11]
Athena Simpson: Yeah. What are your thoughts before we feed you the answer?

[00:03:18]
Ryan Cash: Use it as still use the meeting as a learning opportunity to go through the NDA process and the write up process. But also just be transparent with them about what I just learned from the broker on the opportunity. That said, I don't want to stop him, right? If he gets gung-ho about this and wants to put an offer out, I don't want to stop him from doing that or frame it negatively in any way. If he gets really gung-ho and crazy about it, the broker told me, like, hey, I work on weekends and be working all weekend on this. If you have any questions at all, I'll be open for a call. So if Michael gets really crazy about it and wants to move, like, I'm happy to help him with it. But it is just a little bit of a unique situation. So I definitely wanted to get feedback from the team, given it's my first time going through this process at all.

[00:04:22]
Athena Simpson: Luke, you've got a ton of experience with this. Do you want to feed in?

[00:04:26]
Luke Gillespie: Yeah. So what did the broker say exactly, Cash? Like, they're going to sign an LOI on Monday or are saying an IOI deadline on Monday?

[00:04:34]
Ryan Cash: They've got two IOIs, two LOIs. No more offers after Monday will be accepted.

[00:04:42]
Luke Gillespie: Interesting. Okay. Well, yeah, this is like a learning experience. Next time on the call, you can ask more details about the deadline. Like, oh, is that an IOI deadline or an LOI deadline? Because only having two LOIs on the table isn't that strong. And then if two IOIs are in the mix, that doesn't sound like a very... strict deadline. So brokers do this a lot and will tell you there's going to be a deadline when the deadline doesn't always happen. So like you were saying, you should be upfront and honest about it to Michael. Just like, hey, we were sourcing this for you. And then when I called the broker back to get the NDA sent to you, he told me they're not accepting any more offers on Monday. We don't know how strict of a deadline that is. And then you want to tell Michael in the write-up, right? They've received two LOIs, two IOIs. Explain to him maybe the difference of an IOI and an LOI and how unserious an IOI really is. And you can give him a little caveat of, hey, we're still putting this in front of you because we had sourced it. Yeah, the broker unfortunately gave us that unfortunate update when I was having him send the NDA. But hey, look, use this as your first opportunity. Read over the write-up, practice analyzing a deal. And honestly, brokers put deadlines like this all the time and they don't always end up exactly on. So there could still be a chance for you to get in the mix. Just like give them those caveats, you know?

[00:06:06]
Ryan Cash: Yeah, no, that's totally what I would expect. Good to hear it from the team.

[00:06:16]
Athena Simpson: Yeah, and your timing will be speeded up. Like the time to get the deal in front of the client will be speeded up the more you do this and you get experience and stuff. So it's not a, like, I think it's a plus, right? Like if he loves the deal, I'll just be like, okay, this is going to be, it's reiterating how quickly they need to move on deals when they like it. You know, so we have a lot of, I mean, Luke and I are living this with Dustin and Lindsay right now. They slept on quite a few that they really liked and lost it, you know? And it was like, those were all totally viable, really interesting. Solid deals that we sourced for them and they didn't move quick enough and they lost the opportunities. So now we're having to do more work. So I understand you're probably disappointed with that, but like Luke said, brokers. Two LOIs isn't that many. And also if they've only gotten two IOIs and they like one of the IOIs, they're still going to have to go back to that person and ask for an LOI. Um, so, uh, yeah, but no, I, I'm totally like, I wouldn't say disappointed at all.

[00:07:39]
Ryan Cash: Like if it would have been like closed and all this work had like gone to nothing, then I would be not, uh, disappointed, but pretty pissed. But, um, like the fact that these are the conditions, like, it's just more like logistically making sure that I communicate it effectively. I guess I'm just trying to make sure of that. And, you know, we are going to, especially with this being like a first call with the client, just making sure that we are able to communicate it the best way we can.

[00:08:13]
Athena Simpson: Yeah. And also you can say like, look, it's, you know, we need to make sure that you know what you're doing when you're signing NDAs. So there's a little bit more of a time drag in this. When a brand new search starts warming up too, it's like there, there's a density thing that happens. So like, we're just warming up the bearings and, you know, you can say that to Federico too, like you're in the right place. It's all good. You did an amazing job of handling his wobbles, by the way. I think Charis and Luke should have a look at how you handled that because you did it better than I could have. So well done on that, but it's just reminding them like, Hey, you've signed up for a 12 month process. You know, we told you it's likely going to be at least, you know, six to 12 months before you make an offer on a deal. So the first ones, and you guys have all heard me say this on the calls, what's more important now is them getting their reps in, learning how to talk, learning how to get through to brokers, learning how to look at deals and learn our process. So it's very unlikely the first one's going to be the one that they move on.

[00:09:26]
Ryan Cash: Yeah, 100%. Yeah, definitely. And appreciate the shouts on the Federico thing. I mean, he's a really nice guy. I wasn't really seeing him as like wobbly or shaky. He's just kind of reaching out and trying to get some more information. So luckily I was online and working, was able to kind of get it in front of him in time.

[00:09:47]
Athena Simpson: Yeah. Well, I mean, it's a wobble because they start getting nervous, right? Like he's like, has this been going on for three months and I still haven't seen a deal? No, bud. It's like 20 days. It's all good. You handled it really well. But he also had unrealistic timelines in his head from the start of how long it'll take to acquire a business.

[00:10:08]
Ryan Cash: So we have to keep reiterating that and managing expectations there. I'm concerned a little bit about if there's anything else going on with Federico in the background that's causing these timelines to just keep getting shorter. I actually went back and watched the call. His expectations were actually managed pretty well from the first call with Austin. It's something that he's been educated on multiple times that keeps coming up. So it kind of makes me kind of wonder if there's anything else like causing a necessity with him to really need to get started with this quicker.

[00:10:53]
Athena Simpson: Very interesting observation. And like, depending on the rapport that you build with him, it might be. Worth saying that. Like, hey, I noticed that, you know, we've told you quite a few times, like, this can take a long time, but I noticed you seem to have a different timeline in your head. Is there anything else going on that we should be aware of? That's like, you know, say it in your own cash way, and you've done enough sales to know, like, if you've got that rapport built to be able to, like, say that yet, but it's a really good observation and something to be addressed, because if it keeps coming up, despite us telling him and managing his expectations, like, we need to be able to have the time with you to do our job and get you upskilled for this, you know, is there something else going on?

[00:11:36]
Ryan Cash: Yeah, no, that's totally good way to put that, for sure.

[00:11:43]
Athena Simpson: It's a good spot. not something I'm worried about.

[00:11:45]
Ryan Cash: It is just something I'm more curious about, if anything, but if it comes out.

[00:11:49]
Athena Simpson: It could, you know, and it's, those things will become issues, you know, like, for, like, their perception of this not happening fast enough, or us not understanding things. Their timelines, despite us telling them what our timelines are, so it's good. Or he just needs to have yet another conversation to manage his expectations on how long this takes, you know?

[00:12:11]
Ryan Cash: Yeah, no, it's totally fair.

[00:12:13]
Athena Simpson: It makes your life easier, like reiterating that and managing the client's expectations, you know? I mean, like SMBash, the top like ETA conference that exists, they were saying strap in for three to four years, you know? If you're doing it on your own, so us saying six to 12 months, it's like 25% of the time than what the top ETA events are telling people. So I always like to tell people that so that they manage, like, oh, we're moving fast here. You know, this is moving fast. And strap in, because as soon as we start putting deals in front of you, you're going to have to move really fast. And then likely, you know, when you start getting in your groove and putting deals in front of them, it's going to be them that is the issue for. The deal not coming through, not us. So we're just warming them up. Like what we're seeing with Dustin and Lindsey, you know, like people run on a different timeline than they need to run for deal time. So it's like being patient while also being like super rapid. And it's a weird thing to kind of teach them how to do that. Cool. So what's on the agenda, Anke? Guys, I need to end at like 45 past so that I have time to recharge before Buyer's Club.
SCREEN SHARING: Anke started screen sharing - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/386206877?timestamp=807.441379

[00:13:29]
Anke Jordaan: It's going to be big energy. Okay. So we've got Cash asking a question about some Quiet Light CIMs. Charis is asking or mentioning something about the buyer profiles. She has a question about Falcon deal. And Athena, these are the items that you asked me to put into the agenda for today. Real estate; peer review; AI. Okay. So let's do the first one.

[00:14:00]
Athena Simpson: We already addressed, so we can take that off. Let's do peer reviews first on mine, and then Cash. I bet Luke will have a really great answer for your question.

[00:14:23]
Anke Jordaan: Cool. Yeah.

[00:14:26]
Luke Gillespie: Yeah, we can talk about that first. So you're seeing a lot of Quiet Light CIMs that are saying not going to qualify for SBA. That depends on the client. So for most of our clients, that would be a no, because most of our clients are looking to only utilize SBA financing. However, for Steve and Polly, they're open to using outside capital sources. If it is a much larger deal, they're open to pulling in investors. Or if it's a much smaller deal, they're open to doing it themselves with cash down. And, and, and, uh, Seller financing. So it's not exactly a deal breaker for SP, but for most of your other clients, it probably will be until you have that conversation with those clients and they say they're open to outside investors. Going to be kind of hard, kind of a deal by deal thing. If you're ever unsure about a deal, like send it to me because I know SP and I can tell you if it would work or not work without SBA. But yeah, for SP, doesn't have to be an automatic deal breaker, but for most of our clients, that would be a deal breaker.

[00:15:30]
Athena Simpson: Just to add on that, good answer, Luke. Michael said he was open to private debt, which is another one, depending on who you're looking at for the client. And we typically see, you know, when you go through it, if it looks like a good deal, you'd want to dig into the reason why it won't qualify for SBA, like why they're saying that. It's usually a number of things. The business has not been around that long. There's some volatility in the revenue. Are there some risk factor or something else? you know, understanding the reason behind why it wouldn't qualify for SBA will help also add that layer on and deciding whether it's an automatic disc call or not for the client.

[00:16:17]
Ryan Cash: Yeah. I mean, that's good feedback. Sometimes these Quiet Light CIMs have some kind of detail. Like one of them was just like, it won't qualify due to like tax returns, whatever that means. And then, but like, I'm also curious, like even with Steve and Polly, like, I don't know if things have changed since they have first started, but I know it seems like even with Steve and Polly, like we brought him a deal that was, you know, that was SBA qualified for like, you know, but they had to put like 30% in and they almost. Like completely walked away from that without even like taking a look at it, you know, so I'm kind of concerned that even with Steve and Polly, it like seems like a huge uphill battle with some of these. And I wonder if it's worth the time, like I'm getting to a point where I have to really make decisions on like what I spend my time going into and looking at. But this is just something that probably like half the CIMs that I looked at today were like in this category.

[00:17:36]
Athena Simpson: Yeah, I think it's going to be a good learning exercise for you to find out why. Right. So then then you're kind of learning the characteristics of like SBA qualification versus not and then how to overcome those. So if you bring those examples here, we can be like, oh, we can actually structure it this way. We can get private debt. So, you know, sometimes the owner is willing to do seller finance if it doesn't qualify. for SBA because the types of buyers that come in won't be all cash buyers. And or, you know, private debt, which is different than SBA, where they don't have to put it, they're not going to be putting in, you know, 30% or whatever, they're just going to be going to a private debt lender. That essentially functions as a loan. It's just a different setup, a different category. Usually that needs to be bigger deals, like a million in EBITDA plus. But I would say don't disqualify them without knowing why. then once you know why, bring some of those examples here and we can talk through what might be the solution for the client and that sort of thing. Cause it's, it's always going to be nuanced depends on the client, depends on the deal, depends on the reason. Um, so I see these as good learning opportunities for you to kind of learn that stuff because the more quickly we can get y'all up to speed with like SBA stuff, um, the better so that you can kind of help the clients navigate like, well. It says it's not SBA qualified, but it's because of this, seller's willing to do this, you could do it this way, kind of thing. So you kind of need to know what are all the potential solutions bobbing and weaving around that.

[00:19:13]
Ryan Cash: Yeah, no, that's fair and that's good feedback. I can definitely make a note to just dig in and try to figure out why. It also kind of puts me shaky that it is Quiet Light because I get this kind of, I don't know how much of Quiet Light's terms are just like them putting forward what they think they can sell versus like what is actually like getting SBA approved for certain amounts, if that makes sense.

[00:19:38]
Athena Simpson: Digital businesses are tough. Digital businesses are usually harder to qualify for SBA, but I'd say of all the brokerages, Quiet Light is like one of the most reputable. and well regarded. So I would trust their CIMs over Transworld and everybody else at this point.

[00:20:00]
Ryan Cash: Okay. Alright. Okay.

[00:20:11]
Athena Simpson: Cool. You good on that, Cash?

[00:20:14]
Ryan Cash: Yeah, I'm good. I'm good. Thank you for helping me go through that.

[00:20:22]
Athena Simpson: Awesome. Charis, you're up.

[00:20:30]
Charis Siau: Thank you, Luke. Since we're on the topic of SBA, Gil did have a question because the three partners in the company, they're open to different structuring, right? Whether they stay on or do a full exit. He mentioned that he heard somewhere about SBA that if an owner wants to stay on for longer than a year, even if they transition out of the ownership seat, that... But that disqualifies them for an SBA.

[00:20:34]
Athena Simpson: It's not disqualified.

[00:21:05]
Athena Simpson: The owner can't stay meaningfully involved past a year.

[00:21:10]
Charis Siau: Why?

[00:21:11]
Athena Simpson: It's because the SBA SOP is stupid. I think what they were trying to do is to avoid business owners getting upside. Yeah, exactly. So if somebody is truly doing 100% change, then they say that the owner should be out within a year. Gil is very black and white, but you can kind of get him to see gray. As long as the SBA loan payments are being made, then they're not really scrutinizing what you're doing after the year. So if he wants to keep them on as a consultant or whatever, you know, like Lindsay's keeping her owner on as a designer, a contracted designer. So you. you know, this is one of those gray areas where it's like, well, are you going to, you know, be super strict with that yourself? Usually the bank's kind of like, if we don't know what's happening, like, and loan payments are being made, then okay. But technically, yeah, an owner shouldn't be more, like, meaningfully involved post one year. Um, now, if they want equity in the new business, they will have to fully guarantee the loan for two years. So most of them aren't going to want equity in the new business, but they could get, you know, a salary commission, et cetera.

[00:22:37]
Charis Siau: Okay. Okay. Interesting. So there's some, some options there that we can do. Yeah. I was curious about that because to me that makes little to no sense. I feel like it would help the business for the owner to stay on meaningfully.

[00:22:51]
Athena Simpson: Right. Yeah. SBA has all sorts of wild and wacky. So this is, this is why I'm saying for like you and Cash and, you know. Luke's heard a lot of this, but he's still learning too. And we're all still learning after the SOP shakeup in April. And the lenders are all making, they're still making their interpretations of the SOP change. So I wish it made sense, but I don't understand it, but that is how it's written. So then it's, it's down to, would Gil feel comfortable? Maybe it's not going to be written in the agreement and the APA beyond one year, but, you know, after that, they can kind of decide what they want to do as long as loan payments are being made.

[00:23:37]
Charis Siau: Yeah. Or if they're open to like the, the equity rollover, um, or, um, what was the other one that you said? Not equity rollover.

[00:23:51]
Athena Simpson: Consultancy. Consultancy.

[00:23:52]
Charis Siau: Yeah. Consulting. Yeah. They could do that.

[00:23:55]
Athena Simpson: Yeah. Okay. just won't be written into the APA beyond a year.

[00:24:00]
Charis Siau: The SBA is going to review the asset purchase agreement and everything.

[00:24:04]
Athena Simpson: So this is one of those gray areas, handshake, verbal, whatever. But what he could always do to make him feel a little more comfortable because he is so by the book, doesn't want to do anything wrong, etc. You could say like, look, Gil, what you could say to the owner is like, let's write it in for a year. We'll see how it goes. And then we can always revise something and do something from there. My view is when we write owner agreements, I always advise the clients to say up to the number of hours that they want an owner available. So rather than saying like, I'm going to keep you full time for a year, or I want you working 20 hours a week, we say we would like you available up to 20 hours a week, or we would like you available up to 40 hours a week. At this rate, this hourly rate, so that if things are starting to go south with the owner, that our client has the opportunity to get them out when they need to, as opposed to committing to pay them a year of salary, and then they realize that they don't want to do that.

[00:25:17]
Charis Siau: Yeah, that's true. That's a good point. Yeah.

[00:25:20]
Athena Simpson: I mean, Lindsay and Kevin, like,  the  they went through with the owners on Holdsworth and Nicholas. Like, it was wild. Like, someday I hope we can get them on Buyer's Club sharing it. And they did everything right, you know? And then they had the ability to get them out.

[00:25:41]
Charis Siau: Nash, same thing. He thought he was going to want the owner on, and then he realized, like, as long as he's around, these guys aren't listening to me, because he's the jefe, you know? So he's like, okay, it's time for you to go golfing.

[00:25:53]
Athena Simpson: Please be on the other end of the phone for when I need you. And that's really when he stepped in the role as owner, because as long as the owner's there. Where everybody's going to default to them. So we want to give our clients and plant that seed with them early is like, yes, you want the option to have that person available. But was that, was that a little like time warning Anke that you just did? Okay. I'm learning. She's trying to help me stay on time because I like spending time with you guys and talking about this stuff. So, so yeah, you can, you basically want him to have the owner available, but not committed.

[00:26:33]
Charis Siau: Right. Yep. That makes sense. Don't marry to it. Okay. Thank you for that. So on the going through like their first write up, signing the NDA process in the playbook right now, it's saying that we, we fill it out and then where we can, we're putting like the profile link in there for highlighting credibility. So for the sell side perspective, I'd say that they'll get a lot of rolling eyes because we're not going to their process and filling out information where it's going to be readily available for them. Most likely, it's not the biggest sell point to see, oh, they're working with like, you know, they would think just automatically like buy side advisory. And then they're not filling out their information, which might be tied to their CRM. So I'm just putting it out there that it might not be the best recommendation to just put profile links instead of the actual answers for the clients.

[00:27:43]
Athena Simpson: Luke has a lot more experience with this than I do, but at the point that we're having them fill out the buyer profile, you guys have already talked to the broker and developed a relationship. So we're just kind of going through their process. But Luke, what do you think about that? Yeah, no, Charis, you're right.

[00:27:59]
Luke Gillespie: I totally agree. I agree with you from the sell side. Yeah, the broker would rather see that. But we're trying to serve our clients first and then the brokers second, right? So we care about our clients' experience more than the brokers. And like Athena said, anytime our buyer is filling out the buyer profile, the NDA, we've already talked to the broker, built rapport, we've established credibility. And hopefully by that time, the broker should be excited and happy to work with us and meet with our buyer, right? Like sometimes the brokers will still be sticklers and they'll tell me on the phone and make sure your buyer fills out the buyer profile. And I'll tell the buyer, hey, can you please fill out the buyer profile? The broker asked for it specifically. But, you know, we're trying to serve our clients first before the broker. So we want to make our clients' lives as easy as possible and make them think that we already did the work for them. We already established credibility with the broker. So I agree with you, Charis. You're right. From the sell side, they probably would rather see the buyer profile fully filled out. But we're here to make our clients happy first rather than the brokers. And I haven't.

[00:29:00]
Charis Siau: Experienced it to be that much of a deal breaker in my experience. I get that it's efficient and I get the standpoint of serving our clients, but I want to make sure that we're serving our clients in the way that won't make them option B, C, D, times a thousand for some businesses. Serving the clients better, I think they would rather, you know, they're getting two to four write-ups a month. I think they'd rather it be a quality fill out and completion of where they stand out. And I know, I mean, we're making rapport with the brokers, but they have so much on their plate and, you know, they're not organized. And so they're not going to seriously remember all the details we talked about, you know, on 15 minute call. Again, I love the efficiency with it and I love the approach. But thinking about the long term with clients and the long term with brokers, I don't. I it's the best service at the end of the day.

[00:30:05]
Athena Simpson: So Charis, this is an opportunity for you to think of a solution that saves our clients time and accomplishes the outcome that you're talking about. Because what we can't do is ask our clients to type from scratch and do all that work. Like the whole reason they're hiring us is to make this process as easy and efficient as possible for them, which is why we do the buyer profile, put that link in there and like, hey, please click here to see the full information about me. So I would love if you go away and maybe think of some ways to meet in the middle there. Like how are we doing good by the brokers, but also doing good by our clients and saving them the time of having to like go through and fill things out from scratch every time we put it in front of them.

[00:30:50]
Charis Siau: I can do that. Awesome. And then lastly, on the Falcon deal, Luke, I know that was your deal for Gil. So he's officially passed on it now. So I don't know if you want to like take that for any clients you have. It is a solid deal. So I wanted to check with you before I made any moves with it.

[00:31:13]
Luke Gillespie: Yeah, I don't think it's really that good. It's not really a fit for any of my clients. If I could think of anyone, I would think of maybe Steve and Polly because Steve actually trades stocks. He could literally be a customer for that business. That's what I was thinking. If the cash flow pens out.
ACTION ITEM: Review Falcon deal details from Charis. Assess fit for Steve and Polly, considering Steve's trading background.
- WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/386206877?timestamp=1889.9999  But for my clients, mean, thanks for offering, but it's not a fit for my clients.

[00:31:36]
Charis Siau: So that's cash.

[00:31:40]
Ryan Cash: Steve and Polly is me. I have no idea what Falcon is or what that means at all.
ACTION ITEM: Get written confirmation from Gil that he's officially passing on Falcon deal and OK to present to other clients. Slack message for record.
- WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/386206877?timestamp=1906.9999

[00:31:46]
Charis Siau: Yep. No worries. I can send you the deal details and then you can take a look at it. Let me know if you want to look at Polly. Sounds great.

[00:31:57]
Athena Simpson: Oh, sorry. So just to jump in real quick. Charis, you want to get written confirmation from Gil that he's officially passing and okay for us to pass it to a different client.

[00:32:09]
Charis Siau: I have gotten the official word that he's passed. So you want me to ask if it's okay for the client? Yeah, because he's, you know, it's still kind of like, well, I'm letting you know where I'm at and leaving the door open kind of thing.

[00:32:23]
Athena Simpson: So what you want to do is just be super crystal so we don't get in any hot water with our clients. Um, cause he's passed on other deals before kind of in the heat of passion, but I think if they came back, he would still want to work on him. I feel like this is one of those. So, and you can stress test that by being like, Hey Gil, um, I have another client that I think this might be a fit for. Are you cool? Like, are you officially passed and okay with me putting this in front of another client? And if he's like, wait, wait, wait, wait, then, know, like, okay, he's just doing that emotional. I'm out. So it's a really good. You know, conversation for all three of you to hear because, for all three of you, like, I love the, like, repackaging a deal and get it to another client. I had Steve and Polly in mind, too. But you just want to make sure you get the official, like, you are passing to the point you're okay for me to put this on someone else's desk. So just make sure you guys get that official written in Slack so that there's no, like, what the ? You gave it to somebody else. Yeah, I could see Gil doing that.

[00:33:58]
Charis Siau: And I could see him being like. Wait, wait, wait.

[00:34:00]
Athena Simpson: No, no, no. I still want to leave the door open.

[00:34:03]
Charis Siau: Make sure to cover that off before we pass it over.

[00:34:08]
Athena Simpson: And then Steve and Polly. So Cash, Steve, as you know, is like a trader. And this business is building bespoke computers for traders to spec for them to be able to do the like microsecond thing. So, and it's a remotely-ish run business. So it's an interesting, very interesting one potentially that Steve might really like.

[00:34:34]
Ryan Cash: Yeah, that's super cool, actually.

[00:34:37]
Athena Simpson: Yeah.

[00:34:38]
Ryan Cash: Like I might nerd off on that as well.

[00:34:41]
Charis Siau: Right?

[00:34:45]
Athena Simpson: And I think Steve has the sales and marketing and community chops that he could get the revenue for that. Whereas like Gil had the technical expertise, but Steve actually is actively a part of those trading communities. So sales knowledge is also like no joke.

[00:35:05]
Ryan Cash: Like that guy's pretty, pretty damn good at what he does. Yeah, for sure.

[00:35:14]
Athena Simpson: Awesome. Okay, good stuff. Peer reviews. Okay, so I am very conscious that I am the bottleneck and all of you getting your write-ups out right now. Um, and there's an element of like making sure that there's some like quality control, uh, making sure that you guys are getting what you need in terms of like knowledge and that sort of thing. There's so many nuances to how we do things and SBA and that sort of thing. But the three of you have such exceptional perspectives and backgrounds and they're, they're all different. So I was trying to think like, what's a way that we could get you guys collaborating, learning from each other and remove me as the like bottleneck of reviewing the deals. And I wanted to talk to you. All about how you would feel of having like a review check by a peer, right? So you do a write-up and say like, hey guys, can one of you do a peer review of this for me? And I think you're going to be able to learn through each other that way and probably iterate and do these quicker than trying to put them on my desk and get all my feedback. But I wanted to talk that through with you all and see how you felt about it.

[00:36:30]
Luke Gillespie: Yeah, I think that'd be great.

[00:36:35]
Charis Siau: Yeah.

[00:36:37]
Ryan Cash: Yeah, I think that solves a lot of, I mean, one, the bottleneck, and two, it's an additional like learning opportunity for myself and Charis to look at more reviews and jump into more write-ups. So it seems like value add that solves problems. So all for it.

[00:37:01]
Athena Simpson: Awesome. And then Luke, for you, it's getting different sets of eyes, you know, from the different experience. I think you guys could be like, oh, I've looked at a deal like that before. Like, let me, let me have a look of it. So, you know, what I wanted to do with these meetings was like create collaboration between y'all, but also that to me felt like a easy, quick way to do it. So you can give a review and give feedback on, you know, things that you've experienced before in that industry or just giving it a review from like a business perspective or, you know, each of like Luke has the AcquiMatch experience and has done, you know, hundreds of broker calls, knows all those sorts of things, carries on the sell side cash with your, you know, business and sales experience. it's like, I, I got really excited when I thought about this. And I also get really excited about thinking of removing bottlenecks, especially when I am the bottleneck, but maintaining that kind of quality assurance for the clients. And I thought that was kind of a cool thing if we add it into the write-up. Like reviewed by so that they see like, wow, like we're getting multiple sets of eyes on this and it's a good deal.

[00:38:11]
Ryan Cash: Yeah, it sounds good. guess just probably just need to understand like exactly what the process is we're going to do for that.

[00:38:24]
Athena Simpson: So, well, what might it look like if, if we were to, so I'd come up with the idea, but like, what would you guys, cause you know, also conscious of not wanting to hold you up and add more work. I think as we do, you know, we're kind of at the stage now where we don't have to do the intensive onboarding sessions and training and that sort of thing so that you guys can just start cracking on with your work. So what might a review process look like?

[00:38:54]
Luke Gillespie: I think just asynchronous, like how you've been doing it, Athena, we can just send our write-ups to each other and we can review. can those write-ups, write down comments like, oh, interesting, or write down questions like, what's the price of the real estate? Basically the same thing you've been doing. If I see anything that I know from my experience, I can add a critique. If Charis or Cash sees someone just a question about the deal, what about this? It'll bring up some extra information for me to think of to add into the write-up, things like that I think would be the best way to do it.

[00:39:24]
Ryan Cash: Yeah, mean, that sounds good to me. think just do what we've been doing, post it in the analyst channel, and then make some notes in Notion.

[00:39:41]
Athena Simpson: How about you, Charis? What do you think?

[00:39:44]
Charis Siau: Yeah, I think we just try it the way you've been doing it. And then if we want to, you know, make that just kind of like a living practice, right? And seeing, okay, maybe we have another way, better way of doing it, more efficient way of doing it. But I think because it is a newer process. We'll just take over, adopt what you've been doing, do async, I think is probably the most efficient at this time. And then if we think through it and we're like, hey, actually, like, you know, who knows, getting on a call altogether, who knows, might be more efficient. But yeah, I think just keeping it kind of like living to be able to modify need be.

[00:40:23]
Athena Simpson: So I think that we can do a really cool test run. So my mother's coming to town tomorrow, and I'm going to be out for like an event, my mom next week, something else. So I'm pretty much going to be in all the interviews I'm doing. I've met with 15 advisors, I think, so far.
ACTION ITEM: Start peer reviewing write-ups. Post in analyst channel, review others' write-ups, provide comments in Notion. Trial run for 1 week.
- WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/386206877?timestamp=2439.9999
So you guys have all been through the interview process. You know what it's like on my end. So next week, I'm pretty much going to be out. So maybe we could trial this for a week with y'all doing it amongst yourselves. And then the following deal review Tuesday after Labor Day, we could talk about it. See what we need to tighten up. See if it springs any ideas in terms of like how we could make it a good process, a helpful process, collaborative process. How does that sound?

[00:41:11]
Luke Gillespie: Right. Yeah.

[00:41:13]
Athena Simpson: Give it a trial run for just over a week. And then I guess the request is, you know, just try to keep it equitable so that one person's not reviewing way more deals than somebody else, you know. So I don't know how we keep track of that. But I think you guys could just, you know, if you have some time, jump on it. See what that looks like.

[00:41:36]
Ryan Cash: I don't think it's unreasonable for like with I mean, it's not like volume is going to be too crazy for like if one of us post a deal for the other two to be able to hop in and put their thoughts. Right. I don't think it's too much to have, you know, both sets of eyes on a deal, like rather than try to do this whole like balance, like reviews and all that. Like I think it's easy.

[00:42:05]
Athena Simpson: So keep an eye on what that does for y'all's individual write-up production, if it unnecessarily slows it down, and timeliness in terms of getting those write-ups out. So I guess when you post it, how quickly do we want the reviews done so that we can get the write-ups out to clients? Those will all be things that I think just a week of  around and find out will give you some insight in terms of what do we want to set? Do we want to do an SLA? Hey, review it by end of day, and then I send it out or whatever. But I like it if you guys are up for doing it, everybody on everyone, just to get a sense of what that feels like. Thank you.

[00:43:00]
Anke Jordaan: And then, so if you guys posted in the analyst channel, like you've been doing, just add like the deal link, the scorecard and the buyer profile just to make it easy enough for the other analysts, because you guys don't all know each other's clients. I think Luke knows most of your clients, but with the new people on board, it's just easier with the, or I don't know if, you know, when you were doing it today, was it easier with the buyer profiles just on hand when you were reviewing the write-up if it's somebody else's client?

[00:43:26]
Athena Simpson: I mean, yeah, I'm, I'm less, especially with the new clients. I'm like, I'm less attached to the buyer profile. So it's more to keep me honest. So I'm not like making up stuff about the buyers. Um, and I think it's helpful to just add the buyer profile with the write-up so that you can go and kind of, you know, sense check that person. So, um, and it'll be good to have everybody kind of have a, a cross knowledge of the different clients because, you know, you each are going to want to go on vacation at some point. Right. I'm going to have to cover various clients and that sort of thing, too.

[00:44:03]
Anke Jordaan: I think it's also an opportunity for, you know, hey, Luke, love this write-up. If your client doesn't want it, I'm first in line.

[00:44:10]
Athena Simpson: Like, it's next coming to me. That's a good point. It's going to be a toss-up.

[00:44:16]
Anke Jordaan: Like, who can grab it the first? Athena, you need to go.

[00:44:21]
Athena Simpson: Awesome. I just want to say everybody's been doing awesome. I know it's a lot to learn and get up to speed. Jade and Luke, really appreciate how you've been jumping in and helping. You know, really excited to see you guys taking on the client meetings, the client responses. I'm seeing such great stuff. So I'm really excited about you guys just getting in your groove. Feels like we're really close.

[00:44:49]
Luke Gillespie: Yeah, thank you. So I realize I didn't get to real estate today.

[00:44:53]
Athena Simpson: We'll do that next week, unless there's any, like, super burning questions about real estate. Just throw them in the channel. Um... Anke can get a hold of me. And yeah, I'm excited for this next tax conversation too. I think it'll be things for all of us to think about talking to the client about with the tax side of things as they go into deals.

[00:45:15]
Anke Jordaan: So it should be a fun one. Cool.

[00:45:18]
Luke Gillespie: Enjoy it.

[00:45:19]
Anke Jordaan: Awesome.

[00:45:20]
Athena Simpson: Okay. I'll see you guys in a couple minutes. Thank you.

[00:45:23]
Luke Gillespie: That's good. Bye.
