Below is a focused analysis of likely ASR transcription errors and a mapping of business-relevant vs. removable small talk. I prioritized high-impact business terminology, acronyms, numbers, names, and semantic breaks. I also flagged sections to remove and one borderline section for review.

ERRORS

[Error #1 - Category: Business Terminology (CIM misheard)]
Location: 14:26 / Speaker: Luke Gillespie
Transcript excerpt: "you’re seeing a lot of Quiet Light Sims that are saying not going to qualify for SBA."
Issue: "Sims" used where the industry term is "CIMs" (Confidential Information Memorandums).
Likely intended: "Quiet Light CIMs"

Reasoning: In M&A, brokers share CIMs; "Sim" is a common ASR error for CIM.
Impact: High - Impacts understanding of what document is being referenced.

[Error #2 - Category: Business Terminology (CIM misheard)]

Transcript excerpt: "Sometimes these quite like Sims have some kind of detail..."
Issue: "quite like Sims" likely "Quiet Light CIMs."

Impact: High

Location: 9:47 / Speaker: Athena Simpson
Transcript excerpt: "You handle He it really well."
Issue: Extra/garbled pronoun; sentence malformed.

Location: 2:00 / Speaker: Ryan Cash
Transcript excerpt: "If you're fired, I have any questions at all. I'll be open for a call."

REMOVALS

[REMOVAL #1 - Type: Small Talk/Personal]
Location: 0:00-0:32
Speakers involved: Ryan Cash, Charis Siau
Content excerpt:
"Ryan: The that I'm sure that the content, I'm like a 90s kid, do you know how much my body is filled with microplastics?
Charis: Oh yeah, we're all .
Ryan: Raised on microplastics. Multi-colored microplastics, that neon, neon-colored microplastics from the 90s are just like circulating everywhere."
Reasoning:
Pure small talk unrelated to deals, financing, or client processes.
Context impact: None—the conversation shifts directly to meeting logistics and deals afterward.
Recommended action: REMOVE 0:00-0:32

[REMOVAL #2 - Type: Off-Topic/Meta-Banter]
Location: 33:08-33:18
Speakers involved: Anke Jordaan, Athena Simpson
Content excerpt:
"Athena: ...why do you keep doing the thingy?
Anke: Because I don't want to cut you off.
Athena: Are you saying that because you want to say something?
Anke: No, I'm saying that to keep you on track of the time you have listening."
Reasoning:
Meta-timekeeping banter; not related to deal analysis, clients, or process substance.
Context impact: Low—the surrounding discussion on passing deals and client communications stands alone.
Recommended action: REMOVE 33:08-33:18


BORDERLINE SECTIONS

[BORDERLINE #1 - Requires Review]
Location: 40:23 (within Athena’s block about next week)
Content excerpt: "So my mother's coming to town tomorrow, and I'm going to be out for like an event, my mom next week, something else. So I'm pretty much going to be..."
Business relevance argument: Explains Athena’s limited availability and directly sets up the peer-review trial run and action items for the team.
Personal content argument: Mentions family visit; personal scheduling detail.
Recommendation: KEEP — Provides necessary context for the operational change (peer review trial) and timing expectations.


ADDITIONAL PATTERN NOTES

- Repeated mishearing of "CIM(s)" as "Sim(s)" when referring to Quiet Light materials. Consider an ASR vocabulary boost for CIM, LOI, IOI, NDA, APA, SOP, SBA, Transworld, Quiet Light, SMBash.
- Frequent name errors for "Charis" (heard as "Kara," "Paris") and inconsistent spelling of "Steve and Polly/Pauly." Consider custom speaker profiles and client name dictionaries.
- Occasional truncations/omissions mid-sentence and stray filler insertions; likely due to overlaps or latency in audio. Review timestamps with overlapping talk.

SPEAKER ATTRIBUTION CHECKS

- 20:30 block: The line "It's not disqualified." attached to Charis conflicts with the question Charis is asking and is immediately corrected by Athena in the next line. This may be an ASR fragment or misattribution. Flag for manual review at 20:30-21:05 to ensure the Q/A flow is intact.
