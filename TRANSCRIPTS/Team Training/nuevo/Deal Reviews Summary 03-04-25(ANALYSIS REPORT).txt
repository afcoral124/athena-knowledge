Speaker attribution validation
- No definitive speaker swaps detected, but “AcquiMatch Team” is used for multiple voices; consider verifying who is speaking around 10:16–11:36 where multi-sentence guidance is given, to attribute quotes to Ryan if needed (Athena references Ryan’s approach).

Context preservation checks
- Removing 0:08–1:41 will not break the flow; the meeting naturally pivots to business at 2:06.
- Keep 1:41–2:04 to maintain a clean transition into agenda.
- Analogies (poker, dating) serve as sales coaching; KEEP for educational value.
