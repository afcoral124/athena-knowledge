  He killed it, that's, that's crazy how you just get experience how much, you know, how much you have to share.

0:12 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Oh Kevin, you mean after you go through that?

0:15 - AcquiMatch Team
  Yeah, exactly.

0:18 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah, he presented very well too, it was good at talking about it.

0:24 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, and it's not like... It's really hard to find information like that.

0:36 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah, you're right.

0:39 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Like what the process is going to be like as you go through it, you know, like every lender is different and what's a deal breaker and not.  So I just love the two of them, they're so, they're such a just like rock stars. Yeah, they're cool.

1:33 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  No, Justin's our newest client.

1:35 - Luke Gillespie
  Oh, okay. Nice. Yeah.

1:39 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Have you not watched his thing yet?

1:41 - Luke Gillespie
  Okay, maybe not. Oh, we haven't set up his search yet. don't until Onka brings it up in our morning meetings.

1:46 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  I don't, I don't really touch it. Oh, yeah, Justin's our newest client. So we after they go through the onboarding sessions of me and Ryan, we let them join buyers club now so that they don't feel like they're sitting there waiting for because he's not going to start until March 1st.  But he signed up with us like early January.

2:04 - Luke Gillespie
  Cool, cool. It was his background.

2:08 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  He and Kevin actually worked together. So he's here in part because Kevin told him about us and then he got reminded of us again in the WhatsApp group.  And then he reached out. So him and Kevin worked together at a previous company. So he's got a sales background also.  He's awesome. Like, I just like, he's, he's, how did you describe Ryan?

2:39 - AcquiMatch Team
  He said like, nice, nice guy. He's a good communicator. pretty open to what we do. Working with us seems flexible.

2:53 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, I still have like enough competency and like taking action and stuff. It's like, I don't think we're going to have any.  and the like fear around filling out a model kind of thing with him, you know, he just needs the direction and like kind of like Lindsey and Kevin, it's like they need to talk through stuff, but as soon as you talk about it, like they take action, which is amazing, you know, because like a lot of people you talk about it, you talk about it, talk about it, they won't do the thing, you so he seemed like an action taker, which is great.

3:25 - Luke Gillespie
  Right, like I got asked what write up did you send in the consultant guy as the example.

3:34 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Oh, you're talking about the guy you sent me the write-ups from last time. Um, which ones did I use?  I used, uh, it was like a six million dollar one, I think, on the like height distributor company.

3:50 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah, yeah, that was Aceco.

3:53 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  And then, um, I can't names and the locations on everything.

4:00 - Luke Gillespie
  But it was one of the more further down ones.

4:03 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay, but he was looking at fairly larger deals. So I wanted him to see like kind of a larger deal right up, but yeah, I haven't, I haven't heard back from him after that, but he did ask if he could like be a referral partner to us and I was like, are you talking about just like referring people or business development.  So I sent him a clarification.

4:27 - Luke Gillespie
  Nice.

4:28 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Or we're sending him a clarification email today. yeah, so. Yeah, cool. So how's it going? How are we looking first, first week of fun?

4:40 - Luke Gillespie
  Pretty good.

4:41 - AcquiMatch Team
  want me to start the only thing is, I gotta leave this office in 20 minutes.

4:47 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, it's going to work on finding new times for us to my schedule is just booked out a couple weeks or having to figure out where we can move it around.
  ACTION ITEM: Call JB to discuss HVAC deal negotiation strategy; model different scenarios; prepare market comparisons for HVAC businesses - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/225271576?timestamp=291.9999

4:57 - AcquiMatch Team
  Okay, cool. Yeah, I can start. That's not good.

5:00 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yep.

5:02 - AcquiMatch Team
  OK, so the first thing I want to start with is JB. We got a response from the seller. JB is a little bit upset about the response.  I actually think it's not terrible. OK, so I of want to just walk you through this and see what you think.  Can I share my screen?

5:27 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah. Yep, there you go.
  SCREEN SHARING: Acquimatch started screen sharing - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/225271576?timestamp=331.892523

5:31 - AcquiMatch Team
  Awesome. JB sent over an offer for $2.1 million with a 5% note. He also sent another offer for $2.5 million with a 40% seller note.  OK, now when JB modeled out his offer, he included $150,000 paying himself $30,000 for for insurance, $30,000 to his 401k.  He's like, that's what I want, okay? He included that when he's calculating his debt service coverage ratio, right? So I remodeled this out.  When I saw the message, I modeled this out for me to discuss, and this was my feedback. like, hey, I think he's coming out with this other offer.  I think there's probably room to meet in the middle that might work for both of you. I modeled something out, wanted to show it to you.  I modeled out two, so again, the offer from the seller is $2.5 million with a 5% seller note. I just modeled out $2.4 million with a 10% note, okay?  Now, what that does, I guess to a 1.6 DSCR, 1.59, 1.52, 1.5, okay, it looks pretty good. That's with zero growth.  Okay, so it still looks decent with a 10% seller note and $2.4 million at no growth. The question here that Joe is concerned about is he's like, yeah, but you're not accounting for everything that I want, right?  You're out accounting for check, for my salary, for these insurances, these I want all that to work. And my explanation to him was, well, the free cash flow that are coming out of the business, so after you service the debt is $230k, right, that's zero growth.  So the total of these is 210k, which is how I got to this model. was like, how do I get him to get his enough that he can do all these things he wants to do and still service the debt?  And so that's how I came up with that number. But he's like, well, I want it to be 1.5.

8:00 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Everything all that included and I want to get your thoughts on that a few Yeah, I think I think what you're coaching him on is correct To get an HVAC business off-market it less than like a 4x multiple That's what I told him.

8:29 - AcquiMatch Team
  said I said if this goes on market, it's gonna be, call it, 4.2x. So I like maybe even higher because strategics are buying up  HVAC.

8:37 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So like Are you getting a pretty good deal there is there anything? Okay, so the two offers were 2.1 with 5% and 2.5 with 40% That's correct So and then the seller came back and said 2.5

9:00 - AcquiMatch Team
  at five percent. Right. So we need to counter a little bit higher, I think.

9:07 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Either pull the purchase price down like to 2.3 and do 10 percent or 2.4 and like reduce like increase it to 20 percent.  I feel like that's coming way down from like what? Because it was like you can have it at this.  So you can have it at this. So like meeting in the middle needs to look like meeting in the middle.  But I think it's good to know where the floor is for JB. So is there any way, was the seller doing sales or is there any way to kind of like tie them to commission or like sales or anything after?

9:46 - AcquiMatch Team
  It doesn't seem like the seller's very, no, doesn't seem like he's like a sales guy or anything like that or like really driving sales.  Mentions his wife is doing marketing. She's going to stay off of the company. So that's already been factored in.

10:04 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  One thing I keep meaning to ask y'all too is what is going to be the cost to get a new license?  what does that actually look like in Florida?

10:18 - AcquiMatch Team
  Yeah, that's going to be something that it's going to have to come up. I didn't, I, I thought about discussing that with Joe, although bit further detail, but I wasn't sure if it was the right time in the process.

10:31 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Absolutely. That's a pro forma adjustment, right? Like that is a cost he is going to after transition. And that needs to be added to the pro forma.

10:40 - AcquiMatch Team
  Well, I'm not, I modeled it out here. So we did get confirmation on how much it’ll cost to lease the license.

10:46 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  we, okay.

10:47 - AcquiMatch Team
  Yeah, so we have that already confirmed. But in terms of him acquiring the license and like that process and what that's actually going to look like, I haven't gone following it through that.

10:59 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  What's that? Show me the revenue changes to overtime.

11:04 - AcquiMatch Team
  Yeah, 1.6, 1.9, 2.1.

11:09 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  What's your read or your gauge on the opportunity, like the growth opportunity? Is he saturated? there a lot more that can be done here?

11:20 - AcquiMatch Team
  Everything every time I talk to an HVAC business, they'll say super competitive, meaning that there's tons of opportunity of just taking up more jobs, taking up more bids, just being aggressive, working on operations, doing some marketing, going out visiting accounts.  You know, we have a competitive market. means that you just go out there and just do a little, do that little extra, and there's room to grow.  And he's showing that here, 1.6, 1.9, 2.1, and now he's retiring, right? He's 63 years old.

11:53 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Hmm.

11:56 - AcquiMatch Team
  I think that's the computer.

11:58 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  No, the reason why I'm asking. It's like Joe's basing it on zero growth, but like, you know, it's an HVAC business that is growing, that's off market.  You know, some multiples are typically like risk and also if it's growth. Like there's no variability in the numbers.  Like he hasn't fluctuated. Also like no  maintenance CapEx. Like is that even real? Like does he not need trucks or any equipment to run the business?

12:34 - AcquiMatch Team
  We just did it in the three years to average depreciation, but it's possible that that CapEx number could be pumped up a little bit.  I think you need to remind Joe what he's got. Yeah, so so anyways, I did every time I did, he kept pushing at me.  He was upset and I was like, I was like, He thinks It kind of goes back to the thing that you said about it.  He thinks He's being dishonest. This guy is being dishonest and I'm like, I'm like, know, everyone is dishonest. So I said, look, this is part of the process.  This is an off-market deal. Like he didn't know what he had Right. He's like, he's like, started with $2 million and now he went $3 million and now he's now he came to 2.5 And he said he'd be open to this such and such and now he's saying he doesn't want that.  I'm like, look I think he's literally just he's built this thing for over 20 years He's just trying to make sure he's getting the most out of his value without just giving away on your first offer He was literally the first fellow that I've spent it I said the fact that he if you look at what he did, he literally looked like the opposite direction on pretty much all just points He went from up to asked for a few things there for me.  I don't think anything's like Uh, like a deal breaker. I'm like and and I agree with me about I think the the next offer should be actually little lower than this but what I was trying to show it to Joe is that if we just go a hundred thousand down from what he wants and we just go an extra five percent of note you're still servicing the debt and getting exactly so my goal is like how can we how can I show him you can I can get you what you want and still get him what he wants that doesn't mean we have to submit that all for right yeah show me show me 20 percent on the note yeah that's with zero growth yeah that's just a  sales guy too like it's like you have the skill set to be able to increase it what's a three percent growth rate

15:07 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  But the other thing that Joe's not considering is like the resale value of this.

15:16 - AcquiMatch Team
  Just so this is exactly what I told him, said, he said, look, look how much money I'm making. I'm like, yeah, but you're at year 10, as as you just literally go zero, so I keep modeling out the zero because it's so obtainable.  If you go zero at year 10, your salary goes up $700,000 a year and you own a $2.5 to $3.5 million.  That's the difference.

15:42 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  More. Like HVAC is so  hot. So like go back to the financial model. Do a four exit multiple.

15:56 - AcquiMatch Team
  Here.

15:57 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah. Oh, um, go down to the the service, um, the free cash flow to owners go all the way over.  Oh, it's not multiplying. Hang on, go back up to the exit 2.7. That's on 0%. Go to, um, like 3% growth.  Go back over to the right. Yeah, 4 million, you know. Oh, wait, it's not calculating the exit on this one.  I  it up. Anyways, like he's going to get a minimum of a 4 multiple for this. He doesn't have to stay in it for 10 years too.  He can do it for a couple of years, get reasonable growth, another one, potentially package it up, and then he can  get an even higher multiple with PE.  so he can get in there, do some improvements to it. And so, that if he wants to, but also like an off-market HVAC business within 45 minutes of his  house that has had steady growth and has an owner that wants to retire, that's run this business for 20 years, like this is going to trade for 4-5x easily if it goes off-market.

17:23 - AcquiMatch Team
  Yeah, he's missing it. And I didn't want to, I didn't want to push him because he was so, he was like upset.  So I just kind of like, I said, look, do this. said, send him a message saying, thank you for your offer.  Let me take some time to think about it. Take, take tomorrow to just chill and then take a look at what I said and re-write up and then let's do another call and talk about the next steps.  I think the next steps are draft up a couple different models more, just like you did before. Send him an email and say, hey, um,  I love to discuss us, you know, reach an agreement here. Are you available for lunch or coffee? Get him to the table and go through the terms, talk through what you guys discussed and see if you can get him closer to the middle.  I think he'll meet you in the middle because I said his response time, I've like, I've been doing this for a long time, his response time is very fast.  It's because he's engaged. And Jenna's like, I think the opposite. I think he's trying to he to you after the first day after the weekend.  He's been asking, sending me messages, asking how are things going? I think he's ready to sell. I think you just need to just keep negotiating here.

18:42 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  I think you need to call Joe out at this point because we're seeing a pattern in him that he's not maybe seeing in himself.  Just like when Justin would like deep dive on all the reviews and stuff and like just end up losing deals because he was so terrified of getting it wrong.  I think there's also some. And they do a dress and Joe here like, hey, you have a pattern now of, and we think it's a protective thing, you know, you don't want to get it wrong.  But you do always default to somebody is trying to screw you over or lie to you or be dishonest.  And you hired us because we're advisors to you and we're not seeing anything that would dictate that kind of response, but it is your automatic default response.  And it's usually something that people do to protect themselves through this process. Negotiations are normal, right? Everything that we're seeing here is normal.  And we have seen hundreds of deals between the whole team, like, if not more, right? maybe thousands, I don't know.  So like, I just also take a beat and kind of reflect on, you know, the response is a survival response and something that you're doing to protect yourself, but you might be scared.  And it's okay. Okay, there are going to be multiple checks during this process to make sure that this guy is not screwing you over lying to you.  This is all normal. It is normal to have negotiations at this point. And you want to kind of reframe that you're going to be doing a lot of negotiations a lot more throughout this process.  So I would like to call him out and just be like, Hey, I'd like to bring something in your attention.  We're seeing that's a pattern of yours that you might not realize might hold you back throughout this process. Because if he keeps defaulting to somebody's lying to me, they're screwing me over like they're like, this is this is Joe.  And he knows this about himself. Like, he doesn't want to get it wrong. So everybody has the weird thing that they do when they're scared or whatever.  And it's like, this is Joe's thing that he thinks everybody's trying to lie to him or screw him over.  You know, he's just not trusting. it's like reframe and operate from a place and it's hard to do. Right.  And so I think you can say, like, we know this is really hard. But if you reframe. from a point of I believe this person is operating from a point of wanting to be collaborative and just trying to have a dialogue and a communication and I know that negotiations and changes are normal and I also know that I've hired and I have enough people in my corner that are going to advise me if they see something that would warrant someone being dishonest or you know operating outside the norm that's what we're here for right so trust us to do our job and advise you and also know that you have multiple people the vanks your due diligence the lawyers that are going to catch out if we feel like somebody is doing something dishonest or inappropriate or trying to screw you over I'll do that I think I'll just ask him in the morning and see if he wants to call the afternoon or the next the following right because like it's it's just an emotional response it's not it's not a right  One and sometimes you just need to call it. You saw what I did with Eli when he was  having like he  up like he let his Elle whylaps and then you They're trying to be in a big war Like no,  up, I couldn't directly be like you  up, you know, okay, you know, like You're having an emotional response and don't want you to burn this to the ground here's what you need to do And so sometimes it just helps them to be like you hired us because you trust us right like We're gonna we're gonna we're not gonna advise you from a place of like Knowingly knowing someone's doing something that's not normal or that could be potentially screwing you over a line to you or whatever Like we would tell you if we saw that obviously So if you trust us and also know that you're gonna get people in throughout this process Let's try flipping this and operating from a place of negotiations or normal Changes are normal and this person is probably operating from a place of you know You  Like, they're just wanting to have an honest deal and get rewarded for all the work that they put in.

23:06 - AcquiMatch Team
  Yep. Yep. I'm going to say all that. And I'm also just going to go on market, going to grab two to three off on market HVAC.  So I'm just going to show the whole bottom just so you can get behind the deck. Look, here's a model.  Here's this. Here's this. Here's this. Here's what you have. Right. And it's only going to go up, oh, that's ten years, you know, perfect position right now.  Right. We're the only ones interested. Anyway, I'm going to sell. I'm going to sell. But anyways, yeah, I've got to run, but everything else is going really well.  I'm just going to get a couple quick updates as P's have a call today with a broker seller. They're going let me know how that goes.  And I'm going to try to get them to Model E for this one. Really good one. Excited about that.  Good job, Luke. Hey, I want to try several calls, but I'm all that we're going to. while she did some modeling.  So that's good. She did some she did some stuff. She just told me she entered some data. So I'm gonna get on the call there and just go walk her through and show her some stuff.  So we're gonna do that. It's good. She's actually she's making some progress there. JJ submitted an L.O.I. got the client.  So we're gonna talk through that but she's just since I can L.O.I. got another power washing business. So we're gonna talk about modeling that one out this week.  then and then Jason's talking to lenders and watching what's going on with Chrissie working with Chrissie.

24:42 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  I heard MS for QoE.

24:44 - AcquiMatch Team
  I'm that right now.

24:46 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So everyone else is right. I think you're right to tell Jason like lean on Chris. Chris has been through a million of these.  So like don't ask us what do we do if we don't have the documents ask Chris. Keep us lifted on that conversation.  Like Chris will know what to do or different ways that, you know, sometimes it's getting access to the bank account, so he'll be able to like rebuild things, but don't get the QoE started until he gets his term sheets.

25:12 - AcquiMatch Team
  Yeah, okay, cool. Yeah, I got that's my, well, I'm going to go up to this. I'm going to go home and then I'm going to look through that sheet and just make sure I understand everything in there and then I'm going to respond.

25:21 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  But like, again, like it's good for our learnings and stuff, but you're right. Like Chris is asking for a bunch of things if you can't provide them or the, like tell the owner what's, or tell Chris what's going on with the owner, but also don't start the QoE until you get the term sheets.  So I think he's over confident and kind of running before he's gotten the lending conversations in a good place.

25:44 - AcquiMatch Team
  Okay, cool.

25:45 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So like it's, it's okay to like get your docs to get there and like all the things that you're going to need and that sort of thing, but one first thing's first.  Also, I'm worried that Jason's trying to speak to so many lenders and do this like bidding or things. um, I  I just found another amazing set. Jared guy that was at the event, out of all the lenders, I think I love the sound of his process the most and how much support he gives of the searchers.  He's got a whole team, like he sounds amazing. And also he's totally fine with us, his equity injection, and he said they're willing to stretch on deals and on terms when they know that they have an advisor like us involved.  So the bank actually loves having advisors like us on deals for searchers. Yeah, so I'm gonna probably he likes doing talks on working capital.  So depending on where we get to with Chris next week, I might have Jared come back. But I told Jared I was like tell me all the topics that you love talking about that you think first-time searchers need to know and we'll have you come and do a buy yourself on it.  He loves working capital. He capital and show a QoE report. So if we don't Good enough, like, understanding from that, then I'll have Jared come back and do another one there.

27:04 - AcquiMatch Team
  All right, sounds good.

27:07 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Awesome. Thanks, Ryan.

27:09 - AcquiMatch Team
  OK, awesome. See you guys later.

27:11 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  OK, Bye. Bye. Hey, Luke.

27:17 - Luke Gillespie
  Hey.

27:18 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  How are Luke and beginning of the month?

27:21 - Luke Gillespie
  So far, so good. We're only two days in, but I've been doing a lot of the kind of front end loading into the pipeline.  So the last two days, I pushed 110 RFIs.

27:34 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Holy .

27:35 - Luke Gillespie
  He doesn't have a work cut out for her. Yeah, exactly. was really busy yesterday and today, and then we decided to move forward on that diesel repair shop for Andrew and did the write up.
  ACTION ITEM: Write up corn hole business for Andrew; prepare caring business write-up for SP; follow up w/ broker re landscape co for BH - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/225271576?timestamp=1669.9999  I presented the write up to him and the channel today. Other than that, I have a third report. I can share my screen real quick.
  SCREEN SHARING: Luke started screen sharing - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/225271576?timestamp=1674.880431  OK, there's this other business that interesting. I have it as high priority. I'm going to work on for Andrew.  It's a corn hole. They sell the corn hole tables and the bags online, but then they also create events and run like a little league or like a little tournament or something for corn hole.  So it's a really unique interesting company. I brought it up to Ryan. was like, do you think this would work for Andrew?  he was like, yeah, it looks like an interesting company. So let's move forward on it.

28:24 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So I'm going to work on that one. Great. Corn hole? Is that like a, I feel like that's kind of from his area too.

28:58 - Luke Gillespie
  It doesn't seem like maybe the that would like it would like cornhole though but yeah let's see um as far as new opportunities i have a caring business that i'm planning on doing a write-up for sp i'm getting some more clarification on details from broker so hopefully that i'll turn to write up i'm not getting any huge red flags yet and then there is a landscape company that we want to do a write-up for uh bh but it's not working for sba right now the broker told me they're gonna get the new 2024 tax returns from the owner and then try to get it rechecked by the by an sba lender and try to get that um pre-qualified so if that kid the sba will worry then i could present that to brian but if not it's not gonna work because he doesn't have that flippant cash uh-huh yeah and that's that's all the new concrete deals i have right now  L. Yeah, I was working on a lot of off-market means on Monday. Nothing really concrete turned up.

30:09 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  What about DL?

30:11 - Luke Gillespie
  DL, yes, I again, pushed a bunch of RFIs. I got one Sim for them so far. It's a corporate events party rental business.  And it looks decent. just there were no financials and it was more of a teaser Sim than a real Sim.  So I asked the broker for more details and as far as their deal flow and notion that a lot of really good deals I've been pushing a lot.  So yeah, just waiting to get the Sims in.

30:39 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Let's make sure the first one is a bang. Yeah, because it's kind of the first impression with us. So it's like they've been waiting all this time for their search to start.  So I think we can send some of the wild cards after the fact, but they know it can take two to three weeks from their search to start to get the  first one, ideally sooner, right? Like, I love when you guys get one out immediately, but make sure it's a good one on the first one.  And then we can send the wild cards as like the follow-ups.

31:11 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah, yeah. mean, Dio is one of our top priorities this week. I should be getting it right about this weekend.  Yeah, we, Ryan and I already talked about that.

31:18 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  only go for the best one once their first deal. Love that. Cool. And then any challenges or anything that you're having with brokers or off-market?

31:30 - Luke Gillespie
  How's that all feeling? No, the only challenge I would bring up is just what I've kept flagging since last month, JB's deal flow.  just, I really have nothing for him. that's why Ryan was saying this morning, like, we have to get this off-market HVAC to work.  And it's not like we're trying to push him into a bad deal. an awesome deal. So we, yeah, we really need that to work out for JB because I consistently just see nothing for him and Preston.

31:55 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, we still have to keep sending deals though even when they're like moving on an offer and under offer.  So So it's not really like, we can't stop, we can't not send deals, you know, until they tell us I haven't had this yet, because we haven't had anyone on the new model, like get under offer, but if they wanted to pause, but if they pause, then they don't get us from advisory services in that perspective either.  So I don't think anyone's going to do it.

32:22 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah.

32:22 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So we want to still keep sending them deals.

32:31 - Luke Gillespie
  I mean, I'm just like, I can push for deals that are just like way below his SD target that he wants and then there's really bad fits is all the deals I'm seeing.  Or just I see a lot of e-commerce deals for him, which he was originally interested in, but as time went on, he kind of decided he doesn't want that.

32:51 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah. Well, let's keep looking maybe little bit outside of the radius to might get something that you could like just expand the  Brady's just a little bit like an hour and a half and be like, hey, this came up. It's a little bit outside.

33:06 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah.

33:07 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  like if it's a great deal, maybe that's an option. Also, I haven't heard back from the team, hopefully, David will be letting us know if he wants to start.  So that'll be in areas like Andrew and JB.

33:32 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah, that'd be great. And also, he can take over like the notion stages for me. Sounds awesome.

33:41 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, cool. Well, it was like going to say to you also, no, thank you for sending through all the write-ups.  That was helpful to send over to him. Any like really good write-ups that you're just like, this is  awesome.  I'm like, just send him to me and then maybe me and Anka so we can just have a bank because I used to on the sales process like show people write up.  don't really do that anymore. I'm probably going to revamp the sales process just to give them a little bit of a preview and stuff, but oh, it was an SP one.  It was the like third bridge creative digital marketing one.

34:25 - Luke Gillespie
  was like the music. Oh, no, it was a console tech services.

34:28 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yes, that one was the other one that I because it was like a husband and wife one.

34:33 - Luke Gillespie
  Exactly. I was trying to sell Steve and Paulie on that.

34:36 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, I reduced the selling them a little bit on that front.

34:40 - Luke Gillespie
  I like took out some of that.

34:41 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  I know I know you're doing with them, but I took a little bit when I sent it over to him because I'm going to be like, he's going to be like, what?  He's selling them so much. Well, because it took him six months just to sign an NDA. we have to sell them hard.  Great. Okay. How is

35:03 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah, so we got him both of his write ups last month pretty early in the month. So he's been working on those videos.  Thankfully, he's moving forward on both of them. Ryan said he's trying to. He's going to try to get him to get close to drafting an L.O.I.  believe this week or something. So yeah, we haven't gotten him any new opportunities in quite a couple of weeks now.  So that's another one of the top priorities this week that Ryan Ryan said this week. So he's he's one of the top priorities.  I had car wash that I know we don't like car washes, but for some reason in New Jersey, New York, the only time I've seen that actually profitable car washes.  And there's quite a few of them surprisingly. Oh, is that HedgeStone? Oh, yeah. Are they not accurate?

35:46 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  No, they don't. They don't really know. They're weird and wild.

35:51 - Luke Gillespie
  So like.

35:53 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay, ripple check the HedgeStone before you send it over because they're a bit shady in terms of how they convey the number.  furs and stuff.

36:01 - Luke Gillespie
  Okay, interesting. Yeah, because they never include financials.

36:04 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So I have to ask them for financials. Yep. What else was I going to say? Should it was really important?  Oh, something you mentioned at some point, and I'm sure you guys have addressed this in the call, but you said you're like falling behind on the off-market stuff.  So, like, talk me through that, because the idea is that we're kind of like working everything equally.

36:41 - Luke Gillespie
  that was only last week, because it was the last week of the month. I was rushing on market to get client minimum right after everyone.  So that was only last weekend. Just yesterday I picked up, cleared up all my off-market tasks.

36:54 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  I was only behind by a few days last week. Okay, cool.

36:58 - Luke Gillespie
  But you're feeling like you can do... Yeah, I do the off market every day that day comes in and I do it just last week, know, into the month is it's rough for us.

37:09 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So yeah, because you're seeing now firsthand how valuable those off markets are and like how, you know, like we're already getting clients making offers on them.  So they are, you know, on market is good. you know, we people make offers on on market, but just to be able to put them in non-competitive situation and like, you know, it's amazing.  So I just want to make sure we're not over indexing on the on market.

37:38 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah, no, don't worry. thought it was one of my top priorities. It's my first thing I do when I start my days, my most important priority.

37:45 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Great, cool, awesome. I think that's great. Do you have anything else you want to chat through or anything I can help you with?

37:55 - Luke Gillespie
  No, I think, yeah, I mean, like I said, start of the month. So I might not don't necessarily have that many deals.  I could help, but I'm looking forward to what I think is going to go well. I'm hoping to hear good things about this stuff.  guys hopefully won't get them on to the team. yeah, I'm looking forward to seeing JB and hopefully, like, actually getting close to closing and hopefully it's key.  really want them to, I want this fencing business to work out for them.

38:19 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, I really, I mean, they've, they've been a client now for a year. they need to go get out of here.  Open a business. Well, I was just going to say something else to you My brain is not working today.  Oh, it's exciting when, when you see them like actually, you know, now that you're, you're involved in these deals and you get to see like the next steps, it means it hits differently.  I think when you get to see them like making offers and going through the process, right?

38:57 - Luke Gillespie
  Exactly. You see more of the results of your work. Whereas in before. before I was just like, I was just doing it right up and it maybe didn't mean that much.  now I see like Ryan bringing up the bottling situation and the talks he's having with the clients in these calls today and so it's always nice see that and see where things are going, know.  because like, and then I'm, I know I get better at my job because I might have presented some businesses businesses to ask people like, I know them, just going to turn this one down.  But then there's fencing one I knew, I'm like, oh, they're going to love this.

39:26 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, so cool. Amazing. good work. I don't think I have anything else.

39:37 - Luke Gillespie
  Got anything else? Nope.

39:39 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Cool. excited. Y'all are just absolutely killing it and performing really well together, which is amazing. So it makes my job a lot easier that I can go off and sell what we're doing to people.  The lender that we just I just talked to, I'm like, he's awesome and like, he's really excited about what  we're doing too.

40:01 - Luke Gillespie
  So, yeah, sounds good. I love hearing about all the connections you make.

40:06 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, well, you know, a lot of it is conveying the support that the team give, you know, that it's like, if it was just me, it wouldn't give them nearly as much confidence as the fact that I have all of you brilliant people that are supporting the clients through this process and, you know, just more and more.  We go through this and more exposure we're going to get, the more, you know, we're going to help people and make really great relationships that are going to help us too.
