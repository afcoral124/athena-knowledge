[Error #1 - Category: Business terminology distortion]
Location: ~1:52 / Speaker: Athena Simpson
Transcript excerpt: "...the lenders firewalls won't let them access google documents... the Unders can't access it."
Issue: “Unders” appears instead of “lenders.”
Likely intended: “the lenders can’t access it.”
Confidence: High
Reasoning: Context is lender firewalls/Google Docs access; “Unders” is a phonetic ASR slip.
Impact: High — changes subject of the limitation.

Location: 2:30 / Speaker: Athena Simpson
Transcript excerpt: "There’s three people ... about doing the modeling and doing new like modeling, but she's for clients, but."
Issue: Garbled/clipped sentence; pronoun/phrase doesn’t resolve (“she’s for clients”).
Likely intended: “…doing new modeling/budgets for clients…” (exact wording unclear)
Confidence: Medium
Reasoning: Sentence construction breaks, indicating ASR truncation.
Impact: Medium — obscures point about modeling resource status.

[Error #3 - Category: Semantic inconsistency]
Location: 2:52 / Speaker: Luke Gillespie
Transcript excerpt: "I can give you an update on deals on looking at following that report..."
Issue: Ungrammatical, unclear phrasing.
Likely intended: “I can give you an update on deals; I’m looking at/following that report…”
Confidence: Medium
Reasoning: Function words misrecognized; intent is to give a deal update aligned to a report.
Impact: Low-Medium — minor clarity issue.

[Error #4 - Category: Entity/Initials misheard]
Location: 3:56 / Speaker: Luke Gillespie
Transcript excerpt: "And then D H then This is a commercial, it's a pressure-washing business in Jacksonville."
Issue: Client initials likely misheard as “D H.”
Likely intended: “BH”
Confidence: High
Reasoning: Subsequent references consistently use “BH” for this client.
Impact: Medium — could misattribute client.

[Error #5 - Category: Semantic inconsistency]
Location: 4:22 / Speaker: Luke Gillespie
Transcript excerpt: "One Ida is horrifying and skinny in our pipeline..."
Issue: Phrase is nonsensical in context.
Likely intended: Possibly “One of those is qualifying and staying in our pipeline” or similar.
Confidence: Low-Medium
Reasoning: Severe phonetic distortion; context is two deals from Slack being added to pipeline.
Impact: Medium — confuses status update.

[Error #6 - Category: Entity/Initials misheard]
Location: 5:19 / Speaker: Luke Gillespie
Transcript excerpt: "Next, I have another age deal... they forgot what they taught on."
Issue: “age deal” likely the client initial “AH”; “they forgot” likely “I forgot.”
Likely intended: “another AH deal… I forgot what they teach on.”
Confidence: Medium
Reasoning: AH appears throughout; first person fits surrounding narrative.
Impact: Low-Medium — minor clarity on client/deal.

[Error #7 - Category: Omissions/Truncations]
Location: 5:58 / Speaker: Athena Simpson
Transcript excerpt: "How are we looking otherwise? is in local businesses for him."
Issue: Stray “is”; truncated clause.
Likely intended: “...as in local businesses for him?”
Confidence: Medium
Reasoning: Common ASR drop of lead-in words.
Impact: Low — meaning mostly recoverable.

[Error #8 - Category: Semantic inconsistency]
Location: 6:17 / Speaker: AcquiMatch Team
Transcript excerpt: "I'm also working in off-market form... seller is engaging me... It’s an age factor of $2 million a year of revenue..."
Issue: Multiple distortions: “form” vs “for him”; “is engaging me” likely “isn’t engaging me”; “age factor” likely “HVAC.”
Likely intended: “off-market for him… seller isn’t engaging me… it’s an HVAC that does $2M/yr revenue…”
Confidence: High (HVAC), Medium (isn’t), High (“for him”)
Reasoning: HVAC is a recurring category; “going pretty slow” conflicts with “seller is engaging me.”
Impact: High — changes core deal status and category.

[Error #9 - Category: Misheard word]
Location: 7:37 / Speaker: AcquiMatch Team
Transcript excerpt: "Sorry, can you beat that?"
Issue: “beat” for “repeat.”
Likely intended: “can you repeat that?”

Transcript excerpt: "…I want to get you a business, you know, that you get an alloy under…"
Issue: “alloy” in M&A context.
Likely intended: “LOI (Letter of Intent)”
Confidence: High

Transcript excerpt: "Luke founded on Fireflippers."
Issue: “Fireflippers” is not a known marketplace.

Impact: Medium — proper marketplace identification.

[Error #12 - Category: Misheard Acronym]

Issue: “a lot” likely “LOI.”
Likely intended: “went under LOI.”

Location: ~9:20 / Speaker: AcquiMatch Team
Transcript excerpt: "…got a call where we walk through all the pulp, think I like about it…"
Issue: Garbled; key noun missing (“points,” “bullets,” “pulls”?).
Likely intended: “walked through all the bullet points I like about it.”
Confidence: Low-Medium
Reasoning: Patterned truncation; unclear noun.
Impact: Low — gist remains.

[Error #14 - Category: Homophone/near-homophone]
Location: 11:16 / Speaker: Luke Gillespie
Transcript excerpt: "I can take an accident on the call or something."
Issue: “accident” likely “action.”

Location: 12:16 / Speaker: Luke Gillespie
Transcript excerpt: "They have like a million dollars to even dust…"
Issue: “even dust” in financial context.
Likely intended: “of EBITDA.”
Confidence: High
Reasoning: EBITDA is core metric; phonetic confusion common.
Impact: High — critical financial detail.

[Error #17 - Category: Word choice (minor) / Truncation]
Location: 14:27 / Speaker: Athena Simpson
Transcript excerpt: "So don't agree. Excellent."
Issue: Sentence fragment likely misrendered.
Likely intended: Possibly “So let’s agree—excellent.”

Location: 15:56 / Speaker: Athena Simpson
Transcript excerpt: "If this one ends up not freaking out…"
Issue: “freaking” likely “working.”

Issue: Word salad; missing connectors/pronouns.
Likely intended: Transitioning to AH status update (not feeling well).
Confidence: Medium
Reasoning: Multiple clipped words typical of ASR under crosstalk.
Impact: Medium — initial clause hard to parse.

[Error #22 - Category: Semantic inconsistency]
Location: 24:46 / Speaker: AcquiMatch Team
Transcript excerpt: "…it’s Minnesota, it's not like there's, if she wait eight inches, there's the only four brokers there…"
Issue: “eight inches” nonsensical in time context.
Likely intended: “waits eight weeks/days” (time period).

Impact: Medium.

[Error #23 - Category: Grammar (pluralization)]
Location: 28:52 / Speaker: AcquiMatch Team

Issue: Singular “lender” where plural intended.

Transcript excerpt: "She really likes the business look, the power washing business."
Issue: “look” likely misheard name “Luke.”
Likely intended: “the business Luke [found]/the power washing business.”

Impact: Low.

Location: 28:52 / Speaker: AcquiMatch Team

Impact: Low.

[Error #27 - Category: Entity name misheard]
Location: 41:53 / Speaker: Athena Simpson
Transcript excerpt: "…letting them into buyer's blood after we get their like deal box…"
Issue: “buyer’s blood” for “Buyers Club.”

Impact: Medium — program name.

Removals

[REMOVAL #1 - Type: Personal/Off-Topic]
Location: 32:26-37:23
Speakers involved: Athena Simpson, Luke Gillespie, AcquiMatch Team
Content excerpt:
"Athena: I mean, God, mine was almost 20 years ago… they're not concerned about that…
Luke: And I mean, I don't even know what would you guys do if you didn't have Uber back then?
AcquiMatch Team: That's the thing. have to drive…
[…extended stories about taxis, buses, risky rides, bar nights, concert story, crying to police officer, parents in the 70s, etc…]
Athena: …No, actually… then I stopped drinking six years ago.
Luke: Ryan, have you had a DUI?
AcquiMatch Team: But I have stories.
Athena: …our parents… in the 70s… they just drove drunk…"
Reasoning:
Extended personal anecdotes about past DUIs, nightlife, transportation, and personal history. No business relevance beyond earlier brief reassurance that a past DUI won’t block SBA.
Context impact: Low — Business thread about SBA letter is closed at 32:16 (“we already checked and told her it was fine”). Conversation resumes to business at 37:25 with “Anyways… Gil.”
Recommended action: REMOVE lines 32:26-37:23

Borderline Segments (Requires Review)

[BORDERLINE #1 - Requires Review]
Location: 31:57-32:01
Content excerpt: 
"Athena: I had a D.U.I. Everyone has a D.U.I."
Business relevance argument: Brief reassurance aimed at normalizing a client’s SBA concern; ties directly to SBA pre-qualification letter discussion.
Personal content argument: References personal legal history; could be considered anecdotal and not strictly necessary since the prior line already notes “we checked and told her it was fine.”
Recommendation: KEEP — It’s a brief, context-relevant reassurance before the conversation veers off-topic (which is removed).

[BORDERLINE #2 - Requires Review]
Location: 11:46-12:10
Content excerpt: 
"Athena: …can just hire people to run around in t-shirts… ‘sell me your towing business’… have brand ambassadors on the ground…"
Business relevance argument: Brainstorming off-market sourcing tactics and local direct outreach approaches.
Personal content argument: Light, hypothetical imagery; could be seen as tangential.
Recommendation: KEEP — It pertains to deal sourcing strategy in targeted geographies.

Speaker Attribution/Consistency Notes
- Multiple initials (SP, AH, BH, JB) used for clients consistently; one likely mishearing “D H” should be “BH” (Error #4).
- Long mid-call paragraphs attributed to “AcquiMatch Team” likely Ryan; content fits role (coaching clients), not a misattribution issue.

Patterns Observed (useful for ASR improvement)
- Acronyms/terms: LOI → “alloy”/“a lot”; EBITDA → “even dust”; DUI → “D.U.”
- Industry categories: HVAC → “age back/age factor”
- Roles/entities: broker → “burger/breakers”; Buyers Club → “buyer’s blood”; Empire Flippers → “Fireflippers”
- Common truncations/repairs and dropped function words in fast speech or crosstalk segments.

Notes on Context Preservation
- Removing 32:26-37:23 eliminates extended personal chatter without affecting the SBA letter thread (which is resolved by 32:16) or subsequent deal discussions (resume cleanly at 37:25).
- All client/deal/financing/strategy content retained to preserve business flow.
