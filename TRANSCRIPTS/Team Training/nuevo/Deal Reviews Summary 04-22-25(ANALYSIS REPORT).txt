[Error #1 - Category: Misheard Acronym]
Location: 3:30 / Speaker: AcquiMatch Team
Transcript excerpt: "he said that he's going to submit D. L.I. for the clients business today."
Issue: "D. L.I." appears in M&A context
Likely intended: "LOI (Letter of Intent)"
Confidence: High
Reasoning: LOI is the standard term for an acquisition offer; “D.L.I.” is a common ASR mishearing.
Impact: High - changes key deal status detail

[Error #2 - Category: Misheard Acronym/Terminology]
Location: 3:45 / Speaker: AcquiMatch Team
Transcript excerpt: "we got them to put together an L.I. Non-IOI and a video of himself."
Issue: "L.I. Non-IOI" and pronoun "himself... she's done"
Likely intended: "an LOI (not an IOI) and a video of himself... he's done"
Confidence: High
Reasoning: In deal flow, teams distinguish LOI vs IOI; pronoun slip likely ASR error.
Impact: Medium

[Error #3 - Category: Entity Name]
Location: 1:47-2:11 / Speaker: AcquiMatch Team
Transcript excerpt: "JSN gave the same feedback... the Crown Office sweet spursiness..."
Issue: "JSN" and "Crown Office sweet spursiness" are garbled

Impact: Medium

[Error #4 - Category: Business Terminology Distortion]
Location: 4:12 / Speaker: AcquiMatch Team
Transcript excerpt: "there was a portion of the node change model that seemed to be over time, DSCI was going down"
Issue: "node change model" and "DSCI"
Likely intended: "debt schedule/no-change model" (unclear) and "DSCR"
Confidence: Medium (model term) / High (DSCR)
Reasoning: DSCR (debt service coverage ratio) is standard; “DSCI” is a frequent ASR error. “node change” is semantically odd.
Impact: High (DSCR), Medium (model term)

---
[Error #5 - Category: Financial/Numerical Term]
Location: 5:03 / Speaker: Athena Simpson
Transcript excerpt: "there would be a slight decline over time with the SCR doesn't say exactly like 1.5."

Impact: High

---
[Error #6 - Category: Homophone/Near-homophone]
Location: 4:12 / Speaker: AcquiMatch Team
Transcript excerpt: "showing them how to model out the plants business."
Issue: "plants business" in deal modeling context
Likely intended: "client's business"
Confidence: High

Impact: Medium

---
[Error #7 - Category: Platform/Entity Name]
Location: 3:45 / Speaker: AcquiMatch Team
Transcript excerpt: "he just messaged it in his slide channel"
Issue: "slide channel" as a collaboration tool
Likely intended: "Slack channel"

Location: 3:43 / Speaker: Luke Gillespie
Transcript excerpt: "So, like I said, 19."
Issue: Utterance is truncated and lacks referent

Impact: Low

Location: 7:11 / Speaker: AcquiMatch Team
Transcript excerpt: "we need to have a draft in response to the big business... they were making for strategic. Higher overseas..."
Issue: Garbled phrasing; unclear intent
Likely intended: "response to the big business we discussed; they’re looking for a strategic buyer, possibly overseas"

Reasoning: “strategic buyer” is standard; “higher overseas” is semantically off.
Impact: Medium

---

Location: 8:12 and 14:15 / System/Athena
Transcript excerpt: "SCREEN SHARING: Acquimatch started screen sharing" and "ACRI match in the signature."
Issue: Inconsistent/misspelled brand name
Likely intended: "AcquiMatch"
Confidence: High
Reasoning: Official brand is AcquiMatch; mis-capitalizations/misspellings occur in ASR and system overlays.
Impact: Medium (brand trust/consistency)

---

Location: 10:00 / Speaker: David R
Transcript excerpt: "they are like a lot fewer term from Jackson view"

Location: 20:05 / Speaker: Athena Simpson
Transcript excerpt: "then it plants. seat of distrust... when there's anything that's a jar"
Issue: Misheard idioms

Location: 22:26 / Speaker: Athena Simpson
Transcript excerpt: "the capital K&M, know, always writing in the same way"
Issue: Company initials misheard

Location: 12:20 / Speaker: Athena Simpson
Transcript excerpt: "Jack's have the lawyer dot pro."
Issue: Garbled domain/identifier for the law firm

Impact: Medium

---

Issue: Subject pronoun "we are a law firm" contradicts role

Impact: Medium

---
[Error #20 - Category: Omission/Truncation]
Location: 20:05 / Speaker: Athena Simpson
Transcript excerpt: "the email address doesn't match the but this is like a long history of branding"

Impact: Low-Medium

---
[Error #21 - Category: Misheard Acronym]
Location: 15:38 / Speaker: Athena Simpson
Transcript excerpt: "wording must happen for SBA on performance based notes based on the lawyers."
Issue: Awkward phrasing around SBA policy/lawyer feedback
Likely intended: "specific wording is required for SBA on performance-based seller notes per attorneys"

Impact: Medium

---
[Error #22 - Category: Entity/Location]
Location: 8:31 / Speaker: Athena Simpson
Transcript excerpt: "we were like, uh we're not the right fit so i'd like to you know cover that off"
Issue: Minor truncation; acceptable speech, but “cover that off” okay
Likely intended: N/A (no change)
Confidence: —
Reasoning: Not an error per se; included here to note no issue.
Impact: —

PATTERN NOTE:
- LOI/IOI consistently misheard (LOI→D.L.I., L.I.; "Non-IOI" phrasing).
- DSCR consistently misheard as DSCI/SCR.
- “Slack” misheard as “slide”.
- Several entity names/locations garbled (Jason→JSN; Jacksonville; Crown Office Suites).
- Brand name “AcquiMatch” inconsistently rendered (Acquimatch, ACRI match).
- Multiple truncations/garbled phrases in mid-sentences indicate possible audio quality or crosstalk issues.

REMOVALS
No removal-worthy small talk identified. Conversation remains business-focused (deal status, LOIs, SBA/SOP, outreach/brand integrity, internal process). Brief greetings/closings are professional and should be retained.

BORDERLINE #1 - Requires Review
Location: 20:05-22:26
Content excerpt: "It seems very authentic... brand trust... concert merch analogy... plant a seed of distrust... Guinness World Records branding experience... brand trainings..."
Business relevance argument: Provides concrete guidance on brand consistency for outreach (email/signature alignment), directly connected to reducing spam perception and improving off-market responses.
Personal content argument: Extended anecdote about past role and branding theory could be seen as tangential to immediate deal reviews.
Recommendation: KEEP — It informs current outreach strategy and client perception; valuable internal training context.

BORDERLINE #2 - Requires Review
Location: 16:54-18:50
Content excerpt: "own it with the law firm... humanize the error... potential referral network... draft as Athena..."
Business relevance argument: Directly shapes response strategy to a mis-targeted outreach and explores referral opportunities; process guidance for future responses.
Personal content argument: Light humor (“tech gone wrong,” “oopsies”) and tone coaching could be seen as stylistic.
Recommendation: KEEP — Materially affects how team handles off-market replies and builds referral channels.
