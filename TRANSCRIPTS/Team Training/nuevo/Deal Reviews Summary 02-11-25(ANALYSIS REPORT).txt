Detected transcription errors
[Error #1 - Category: Business terminology/entity name]
Location: 3:39 / Speaker: Athena Simpson
Transcript excerpt: “I was going to tell uncle tends to deal team just to scrape for the letters IT…”
Issue: “uncle tends to deal team” is incoherent in context.
Likely intended: “I was going to tell Anka to tell the deal team…” (or “I’m going to tell Anka/the deal team…”)
Confidence: High
Reasoning: Anka is mentioned later as a teammate; phrase structure suggests instruction routing via Anka to deal team.
Impact: Medium — affects who should act.

[Error #2 - Category: Entity name consistency]
Location: 3:39 / Speaker: Athena Simpson
Transcript excerpt: “…I would, Ryan, like work with Gail and just be like, can you…”
Issue: “Gail” likely refers to previously referenced “Gil.”
Likely intended: “Gil”
Confidence: High
Reasoning: Earlier at 1:08 Luke references “Gil’s personality.” Same client context.
Impact: Medium

[Error #3 - Category: Misheard pronoun]
Location: 15:25 / Speaker: Athena Simpson
Transcript excerpt: “Did you run the offer past you before you sent it, Ryan…”
Issue: Reflexive “you” misapplied; asking if client ran the offer past Ryan.
Likely intended: “Did he run the offer past you before he sent it, Ryan…”
Confidence: High
Reasoning: Ryan later answers as reviewer; subject must be client (Chris).
Impact: Medium

[Error #4 - Category: Omission/truncation]
Location: 16:23 / Speaker: Athena Simpson
Transcript excerpt: “…if they’ve done something meaningful like some in an LOI or an IOI…”
Issue: Missing verb/object makes phrase nonsensical.
Likely intended: “…like submitted an LOI or an IOI…”
Confidence: High
Reasoning: Standard phrasing in deal reviews.
Impact: Medium

[Error #5 - Category: Misheard wording]
Location: 17:37 / Speaker: Athena Simpson
Transcript excerpt: “And I can’t doing IOIs instead of LOI…”
Issue: Ungrammatical; singular/plural mismatch.
Likely intended: “And kind of doing IOIs instead of LOIs…”
Confidence: Medium
Reasoning: Fits established point about competitiveness and offer type.
Impact: Low

[Error #6 - Category: Financial/metric term]
Location: 19:32 / Speaker: Luke Gillespie
Transcript excerpt: “…even at asking price, it’s priced super cheaply. And he still has a 2.5 DSCR and almost 600 KSD.”
Issue: “KSD” is not a standard metric; likely SDE.
Likely intended: “600k SDE”
Confidence: High
Reasoning: SDE is repeatedly used elsewhere; “KSD” is an ASR artifact.
Impact: High — misstates financial metric.

[Error #7 - Category: Misheard acronym]
Location: 19:47 / Speaker: Luke Gillespie
Transcript excerpt: “…the one where he got his eye rejected because he sent it under.”
Issue: “eye rejected” in deal context.
Likely intended: “IOI rejected”
Confidence: High
Reasoning: Discussion is about indications of interest and competitiveness.
Impact: High

[Error #8 - Category: Entity/brand name]
Location: 27:13 / Speaker: Luke Gillespie
Transcript excerpt: “…from that updating email and the Aquaman branding…”
Issue: Company name misheard.
Likely intended: “AcquiMatch branding”
Confidence: High
Reasoning: Company is AcquiMatch; “Aquaman” is a common phonetic mishear.
Impact: Medium

[Error #9 - Category: Semantic inconsistency/truncation]
Location: 27:09 / Speaker: Athena Simpson
Transcript excerpt: “We love catching a Marley.”
Issue: Phrase is nonsensical in context of early lead discovery.
Likely intended: “We love catching them early.”
Confidence: Medium
Reasoning: Conversation is about being first to a new listing.
Impact: Low

[Error #10 - Category: Misheard term]
Location: 32:25 / Speaker: Athena Simpson
Transcript excerpt: “Was this SBA pretty cool?”
Issue: “pretty cool” is off in lending context.
Likely intended: “SBA prequal” (pre-qualified)
Confidence: High
Reasoning: Immediately followed by Luke: “it’s been SBA pre-qualified…”
Impact: Medium

[Error #11 - Category: Business terminology]
Location: 35:28 / Speaker: Athena Simpson
Transcript excerpt: “…these blue column service businesses…”
Issue: Phrase should be industry term.
Likely intended: “blue collar service businesses”
Confidence: High
Reasoning: Common term in SMB services.
Impact: Medium

[Error #12 - Category: Business terminology]
Location: 37:00 / Speaker: Luke Gillespie
Transcript excerpt: “…growth opps, areas of concern… and Lord’s concerns.”
Issue: “and Lord’s” likely “landlord’s.”
Likely intended: “landlord’s concerns”
Confidence: High
Reasoning: Prior sentence: landlord is a stickler; seller experience requirement.
Impact: High — changes risk source.

[Error #13 - Category: Word substitution]
Location: 42:55 / Speaker: Athena Simpson
Transcript excerpt: “504, on the other hand, would be a separate loan. phone in addition to the seven a…”
Issue: “phone” should be “loan.”
Likely intended: “…separate loan in addition to the 7(a).”
Confidence: High
Reasoning: Explaining SBA 504 structure.
Impact: Medium

[Error #14 - Category: Word substitution]
Location: 46:06 / Speaker: Athena Simpson
Transcript excerpt: “Most of the time we’re actually going to want them to do two separate logs.”
Issue: “logs” should be “loans.”
Likely intended: “two separate loans.”
Confidence: High
Reasoning: Ongoing 7(a)/504 discussion.
Impact: Medium

[Error #15 - Category: Semantic inconsistency]
Location: 37:00 / Speaker: Luke Gillespie
Transcript excerpt: “…this guy doesn’t want to be in trouble for the new owner just to take it over at that value…”
Issue: Phrase is awkward/unclear.
Likely intended: Something like “doesn’t want to be difficult” or “wants an easy transition for new owner.”
Confidence: Low
Reasoning: Could reflect speaker’s rough paraphrase; ambiguous.
Impact: Low

[Error #16 - Category: Misheard acronym]
Location: 53:32 / Speaker: Athena Simpson
Transcript excerpt: “We’ve gotten nine signed L.O.5 since we’ve started too.”
Issue: “L.O.5” not a valid acronym here.
Likely intended: “LOIs”
Confidence: High
Reasoning: Context is signed Letters of Intent; “5” is a common ASR substitution for “I.”
Impact: Medium

[Error #17 - Category: Financial/numerical term]
Location: 24:xx (around 25:45-26:05) / Speaker: Luke Gillespie
Transcript excerpt: “…they’re adding back the 200 out of the 500. DK in advertising…”
Issue: “DK” likely misheard for “$500k.”
Likely intended: “$500k in advertising”
Confidence: High
Reasoning: Earlier he cites $553k advertising; shorthand “500k” is consistent.
Impact: Medium

[Error #18 - Category: Misheard term]
Location: 41:00 / Speaker: Athena Simpson
Transcript excerpt: “…it won’t be the 25 year mr but it’ll qualify for more like a 20 year amortization…”
Issue: “mr” is truncated.
Likely intended: “am[ortization]”
Confidence: Medium
Reasoning: She’s clearly explaining amortization terms.
Impact: Low

[Error #19 - Category: Grammar/possessive (only due to clarity)]
Location: 38:16 / Speaker: AcquiMatch Team
Transcript excerpt: “what was the reason for the plumbers selling?”
Issue: Missing possessive could confuse.
Likely intended: “plumber’s”
Confidence: Medium
Reasoning: Single seller context.
Impact: Low

Removals (personal/off-topic)
[REMOVAL #1 - Type: Off-Topic/Small Talk]
Location: 52:27-53:20
Speakers involved: Athena, Luke, AcquiMatch Team
Content excerpt:
“Athena: Oh my gosh, I didn’t show you guys. Hang on. I’m in swab hands still last. We got some new like thingies.
Luke: Nice.
Athena: I think these look a lot better than the original ones.
AcquiMatch Team: They’re cool. Hold Rick and Nicholas. That’s it. Okay. Wow.
Athena: …yeah, like we match. …it looked like a piece of paper stuck to a piece of acrylic… I want a lot more of these this year…”
Reasoning:
Show-and-tell about acrylic “thingies”/awards and branding aesthetics. No deal, client, or process content; purely internal swag/celebration banter.
Context impact: Low — subsequent section returns to LOI counts and wrap-up cleanly.
Recommended action: REMOVE 52:27-53:20

[REMOVAL #2 - Type: Personal]
Location: 11:40-11:54 (subset of the 11:40-12:12 block)
Speakers involved: AcquiMatch Team
Content excerpt:
“…she had a meeting scheduled with me for yesterday. Yesterday, she canceled and said that she had to be in hospital. So she is in the ER. So that’s unfortunate…”
Reasoning:
Personal health information about a client/contact; not necessary to retain beyond noting that the meeting was canceled and follow-up is required.
Context impact: Low — keep the follow-up/action item notes while removing medical details.
Recommended action: REMOVE 11:40-11:54; KEEP the subsequent plan to follow up.

Borderline segments (requires review)
[BORDERLINE #1 - Requires Review]
Location: 11:40-12:12 (remaining portion after removing 11:40-11:54)
Content excerpt: “ACTION ITEM: Follow up w/ VH re broker intros made… So… we’re just gonna have to follow up with her in a couple of days to see what the latest is on her.”
Business relevance argument: Explains status of a client/broker-intro follow-up and sets next steps.
Personal content argument: Surrounding context references a personal ER visit (recommended removed).
Recommendation: KEEP the non-health portions (meeting canceled, follow-up planned, action item).

Systematic ASR patterns to note
- LOI/IOI misheard as “L.O.5”, “eye”, scattered casing/punctuation (LOI/IOI). High priority to train on deal acronyms.
- SDE misrendered as “SD”/“KSD”. Financial metrics and units (k) need tighter models.
- Company/brand names: “AcquiMatch” → “Aquaman”.
- Real estate/lending terms: “loan” misheard as “phone/logs”; “amortization” truncated (“mr”); “landlord” → “and Lord”.
- Proper names: “Gil” → “Gail”; “Anka” → “uncle”.

Speaker attribution validation
- No clear turn-level misattributions detected; occasional pronoun/subject confusion (Error #3) appears to be ASR wording rather than speaker swap.

Cross-reference/consistency notes
- Financial discussion around plumbing business: ensure SDE is treated as ~$448k if advertising add-back is rejected; DSCR/SDE recalcs reference this consistently later (team aligns on this).
- SBA prequalification: Confirm that “$1.5 million” prequal (32:37-32:40) is clearly below asking; ensure write-up uses buyer’s minimum SDE requirement (200k) consistently.

End result
- Remove identified off-topic and personal-health details as specified.
- Review and correct high-impact ASR errors (especially acronyms, metrics, brand/entity names) to preserve financial and deal-structuring clarity.
