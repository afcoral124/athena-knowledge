Below is a structured review of potential ASR/transcription errors and a content map indicating what to keep vs. remove. I focused on high-impact business terms, acronyms, numbers, and any content that might be off-topic.

TRANSCRIPTION ERRORS

[Error #1 - Category: Misheard Acronym/Term]
Location: 24:24 / Speaker: AcquiMatch Team
Transcript excerpt: “...set up call for him next week, sorry, for Tuesday, submit the LMI, do a video...”
Issue: “LMI” appears in the M&A offer context.
Likely intended: “LOI” (Letter of Intent)
Confidence: High
Reasoning: “LOI” is standard terminology for offers. “LMI” is not relevant here.
Impact: High

[Error #2 - Category: Misheard Acronym/Term]
Location: 22:00-22:34 / Speaker: AcquiMatch Team
Transcript excerpt: “...it’s doing $1.3 million even though... it has no asking price... pushing the ds dr to about one point... at $5.5 million asking price.”
Issue: “even though” and “ds dr” do not fit; numbers garbled.
Likely intended: “$1.3 million EBITDA… DSCR… to about 1.x at a $5.5 million asking price.”
Confidence: High
Reasoning: EBITDA and DSCR are standard; “even though/ds dr” are classic ASR confusions.
Impact: High

[Error #3 - Category: Misheard Acronym]
Location: 33:43-36:08 / Speaker: AcquiMatch Team
Transcript excerpt: “...about a million dollars EBITDA, but you wanted... 10 million dollars, so you wanted 10 X...”
Issue: Minor clarity issues elsewhere in this section, but EBITDA use is correct here; flagging pattern instead: elsewhere EBITDA is misheard (see Error #2 and Error #10).
Likely intended: N/A (note pattern)
Confidence: High
Reasoning: Consistent mishearing of EBITDA in other places; documenting pattern for ASR improvement.
Impact: Medium

[Error #4 - Category: Financial/Numerical Error]
Location: 29:18-29:47 / Speaker: Luke Gillespie
Transcript excerpt: “...did like 350k revenue... before that he said he was doing more like $1 billion of revenue.”
Issue: “$1 billion” for a tree service is implausible and contradicts context.
Likely intended: “$1 million”
Confidence: High
Reasoning: Scale mismatch; tree service doing $1B is not credible in this context.
Impact: High

[Error #5 - Category: Business Terminology Distortion]
Location: 14:03-14:29 / Speaker: Luke Gillespie
Transcript excerpt: “...Sims that are sitting in the Simbang... these really low-quality internet online companies... those online Sims...”
Issue: “Sims / Simbang” likely intended to be “CIMs / CIM bank.”
Likely intended: “CIMs” (Confidential Information Memoranda) and “CIM bank/repository”
Confidence: High
Reasoning: In buy-side workflows, “CIMs” is standard; “Sims/Simbang” is ASR artifact.
Impact: High

[Error #6 - Category: Homophone/Near-homophone]
Location: 10:24 / Speaker: David R
Transcript excerpt: “Because that’s where the throwing company is.”
Issue: “throwing company” in context of Florida markets and earlier towing/catering references.
Likely intended: “towing company”
Confidence: High
Reasoning: Earlier references mention towing; “throwing” is nonsensical here.
Impact: Medium

[Error #7 - Category: Homophone/Near-homophone]
Location: 19:47-20:03 / Speakers: Athena / Luke
Transcript excerpt: “He used to run a cheap rental company out of Hawaii... There was like those RVs, those spritter vans...”
Issue: “cheap rental” and “spritter vans.”
Likely intended: “Jeep rental” and “Sprinter vans”
Confidence: High
Reasoning: Common market terms; context of vehicle rentals fits Jeep/Sprinter.
Impact: Medium

[Error #8 - Category: Idiom Misheard]
Location: 21:50 / Speaker: Athena Simpson
Transcript excerpt: “Well, we know, we know he shoots from the head.”
Issue: Idiom incorrect.
Likely intended: “shoots from the hip”
Confidence: High
Reasoning: Standard idiom; “head” is a mishearing.
Impact: Low

[Error #9 - Category: Misheard Acronym/Term]
Location: 39:58-41:05 / Speakers: Luke / AcquiMatch Team
Transcript excerpt: “Double digit, even the multiple valuation price... Double digit, even the dot.”
Issue: “even the”/“even the dot” in discussion of earnings and multiples.
Likely intended: “double-digit EBITDA... double-digit multiple”
Confidence: High
Reasoning: M&A valuation context uses EBITDA and multiples; phrasing is garbled.
Impact: High

[Error #10 - Category: Business Terminology/Proper Noun]
Location: 40:40-42:00 / Speakers: AcquiMatch Team / Athena
Transcript excerpt: “...legally avoid capital gains tax, it refers to Lehman Formula Agency... reverse laymen issues...”
Issue: “Laymen” misspelling and phrase confusion.
Likely intended: “Lehman Formula” and “reverse Lehman”
Confidence: High
Reasoning: Standard industry term is Lehman Formula.
Impact: Medium

[Error #11 - Category: Omission/Truncation]
Location: 1:07:16-1:08:07 / Speakers: AcquiMatch Team / Athena
Transcript excerpt: “...he asked for no explicitly. 70.” Followed by “We agreed on 60 days and 70 90...”
Issue: Missing words create confusion around exclusivity duration.
Likely intended: “no exclusivity” and “60–90 days”
Confidence: High
Reasoning: Subsequent discussion clarifies exclusivity; dangling “70.”
Impact: Medium

[Error #12 - Category: Semantic Inconsistency]
Location: 26:08-26:29 / Speakers: Athena / AcquiMatch Team
Transcript excerpt: “...forgive it will not go if he really likes that.”
Issue: Phrase is not coherent with surrounding discussion about customer concentration and doctor’s office.
Likely intended: Something like “forgive it” is off; likely “figure it will not go” or “if he really likes it.”
Confidence: Low
Reasoning: Hard to reconstruct exact phrase; meaning unclear.
Impact: Medium

[Error #13 - Category: Misheard Term]
Location: 38:51-39:15 / Speaker: Athena Simpson
Transcript excerpt: “...Diogation consideration wasn’t in line...”
Issue: “Diogation” is not a relevant term in context.
Likely intended: “valuation consideration”
Confidence: High
Reasoning: Fits the valuation alignment context.
Impact: Medium

[Error #14 - Category: Homophone/Near-homophone]
Location: 43:24-43:47 / Speakers: David / Athena
Transcript excerpt: “Oh, that’s the only response we got... It might take a more thoughtful response...”
Issue: This section is fine; pattern note instead: Earlier “emails in the Congo.”
Likely intended: “emails in the convo”
Confidence: Medium
Reasoning: “Congo” likely “convo” (conversation) per context.
Impact: Low

[Error #15 - Category: Misheard Acronym]
Location: 1:08:39-1:10:18 / Speaker: Athena Simpson
Transcript excerpt: “...Q V reports... you’re going to pay a QV...”
Issue: “QV/QV reports”
Likely intended: “QoE (Quality of Earnings) report”
Confidence: High
Reasoning: Due diligence context; QoE is standard.
Impact: High

[Error #16 - Category: Business Terminology Distortion]
Location: 55:00-56:14 / Speaker: AcquiMatch Team
Transcript excerpt: “...model, stock recycling equity, a stock versus asset sale...”
Issue: Phrase “stock recycling equity” is nonstandard/garbled.
Likely intended: Something like “stock (share) vs. asset sale; equity rollover” (uncertain)
Confidence: Medium
Reasoning: Discussion is about stock vs. asset deals; “recycling equity” is unusual phrasing in this context.
Impact: Medium

[Error #17 - Category: Misheard Acronym]
Location: 1:01:33-1:02:04 / Speaker: Athena Simpson
Transcript excerpt: “...going under yellow I... they do a document review for yellow I...”
Issue: “yellow I” is not a term.
Likely intended: “LOI”
Confidence: High
Reasoning: Consistent LOI context; recurring ASR pattern.
Impact: High

[Error #18 - Category: Inconsistent Entity Name]
Location: Multiple (e.g., 32:17; 49:55; 50:48) / Speakers: Various
Transcript excerpt: “Eda’s off tomorrow...” vs. “Ida had in her report...” vs. “when Eda’s back on Tuesday...”
Issue: “Eda/Ida” used inconsistently for the same person.
Likely intended: One consistent name (likely “Eda”)
Confidence: Medium
Reasoning: Role context implies the same team member; mixed spelling suggests ASR variance.
Impact: Medium

[Error #19 - Category: Homophone/Near-homophone]
Location: 13:47 / Speaker: Athena Simpson
Transcript excerpt: “Okay, so Paul’s in his court on that last one?”
Issue: “Paul’s” vs. idiom “ball’s in his court”
Likely intended: “Ball’s in his court”
Confidence: High
Reasoning: Standard idiom; no person named Paul referenced in this context.
Impact: Low

[Error #20 - Category: Minor Mishearing/Idiom]
Location: 35:54-36:39 / Speaker: Athena Simpson
Transcript excerpt: “...I have it equity is not going to be 10 extra million and even either.”
Issue: Garbled phrase during valuation discussion.
Likely intended: “Private equity is not going to pay 10x for $1 million EBITDA either.”
Confidence: Medium
Reasoning: Matches context about unrealistic 10x ask.
Impact: Medium

[Error #21 - Category: Misheard Acronym/Term]
Location: 1:20:35-1:20:51 / Speakers: Kate / Athena
Transcript excerpt: “...what your wins are for the week... lots of Eloise flying.”
Issue: “Eloise” in deal context.
Likely intended: “LOIs” (plural of LOI)
Confidence: High
Reasoning: Frequent LOI discussion; “Eloise” is a person’s name, off here.
Impact: Low

[Error #22 - Category: Truncation/Omission]
Location: 31:19-31:34 / Speaker: AcquiMatch Team
Transcript excerpt: “...I also I had emailed him before and says there are you available the first thing called tomorrow called up with them and responded...”
Issue: Sentence broken/truncated, hard to follow.
Likely intended: Scheduling outreach with seller; responses unclear.
Confidence: Medium
Reasoning: Multiple missing words; meaning obscured.
Impact: Medium

[Error #23 - Category: Misheard Acronym]
Location: 19:12-19:42 / Speaker: Luke Gillespie
Transcript excerpt: “...anything with landscaping, construction, HV, plumbing...”
Issue: “HV” truncated.
Likely intended: “HVAC”
Confidence: High
Reasoning: Standard services category; HVAC commonly paired with plumbing.
Impact: Low

[Error #24 - Category: Inconsistent Location Name]
Location: 12:22-13:47 / Speaker: Luke Gillespie
Transcript excerpt: “...low deal flow and Jackson...”
Issue: “Jackson” vs. “Jacksonville”
Likely intended: “Jacksonville”
Confidence: High
Reasoning: Later clarified; client BH is in Jacksonville.
Impact: Low

[Error #25 - Category: Misheard Word]
Location: 29:53-30:27 / Speaker: Athena Simpson
Transcript excerpt: “...health powers is like they want to get out...”
Issue: “health powers”
Likely intended: “health problems”
Confidence: High

Impact: Low

[Error #26 - Category: Misheard Word]
Location: 30:37-30:45 / Speaker: Luke Gillespie
Transcript excerpt: “...I don’t remember the emails in the Congo.”
Issue: “Congo”
Likely intended: “convo” (conversation) or “thread”
Confidence: Medium
Reasoning: Internal discussion context; “Congo” is nonsensical here.
Impact: Low

REMOVALS

[REMOVAL #1 - Type: Small Talk/Tech Setup]
Location: 0:05-0:18
Speakers involved: Athena, Luke, Anke
Content excerpt:
“Athena: Okay, and someone talks so I can hear if my sounds working.
Luke: Yeah, you’re good. Sounds good.
Athena: It’s not connecting to my speaker though.
Anke: So let’s see. Test days one, two, Yeah, yeah, yeah.”
Reasoning:
Purely technical sound check and setup; no business relevance.
Context impact: None
Recommended action: REMOVE 0:05-0:18

[REMOVAL #2 - Type: Small Talk/Personal Aside]
Location: 7:04
Speakers involved: Athena
Content excerpt:
“Oh, one sec guys. forgot to close my door while you pull it up. Okay.”
Reasoning:
Brief personal aside; not adding business value.
Context impact: None
Recommended action: REMOVE 7:04 line only

[REMOVAL #3 - Type: Small Talk/Closing Pleasantry]
Location: 1:20:21-1:20:29
Speakers involved: Athena, Anke
Content excerpt:
“Anke: All right, that’s…
Athena: Tomorrow is my favorite day.”
Reasoning:
Non-business pleasantry; can be removed without affecting comprehension.
Context impact: None
Recommended action: REMOVE 1:20:21-1:20:29 (only the pleasantry line if line-level edit is preferred)


BORDERLINE SEGMENTS (Requires Review)

[BORDERLINE #1 - Requires Review]
Location: 1:02:47-1:05:06
Content excerpt: Athena’s anecdote about a yoga/dance teacher in Tulum with a broken bicycle to illustrate self-imposed obstacles.
Business relevance argument: Provides a useful analogy on buyer/seller psychology (self-sabotage) relevant to managing client behavior and deal momentum.
Personal content argument: Extended personal anecdote; not directly tied to a specific deal or client.
Recommendation: KEEP—It supports coaching/strategy on client management, aligning with educational/strategic guidance.

[BORDERLINE #2 - Requires Review]
Location: 27:18-27:47
Content excerpt: “She is in that position. She needs a double lung transplant.”
Business relevance argument: Explains seller motivation/urgency, materially affecting negotiating leverage and pricing/terms.
Personal content argument: Sensitive health information about a third party.
Recommendation: KEEP—Directly relevant to deal strategy and negotiation; provides material context.


NOTES ON SPEAKER/CONTEXT COHERENCE AND PATTERNS

- LOI acronym is repeatedly mis-transcribed (“ally,” “LMI,” “L.O.Y.,” “yellow I”). This is a high-priority ASR pattern to fix.
- EBITDA and DSCR are frequently distorted (“even though,” “ds dr”). High priority as these affect core financial meaning.
- CIM/CIM bank consistently misheard as “Sim/Simbang.” High priority terminology correction for M&A context.
- QoE consistently mis-transcribed as “QV.” High priority.
- Several homophones degrade clarity but are recoverable by context (“towing/throwing,” “Jeep/cheap,” “Sprinter/spritter,” “ball’s/Paul’s,” “convo/Congo”).
- Minor closing/greeting pleasantries are brief and mostly business-adjacent; minimal removals recommended to preserve natural flow.
- No clear speaker misattribution identified that would invert roles; “AcquiMatch Team” is used as a composite label for one participant (likely Ryan). Content flow is coherent.

If you’d like, I can cluster these error patterns (e.g., LOI/EBITDA/DSCR/CIM/QoE) into a cheat sheet for ASR engine tuning and provide a quick reference for reviewers.
