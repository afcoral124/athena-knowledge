TRANSCRIPT - CORRECTED VERSION

Athena Simpson: Hello.

Luke Gillespie: Hey.

Athena Simpson: How's it going?

Luke Gillespie: Good. about you?

Athena Simpson: I'm good. What's going on? Hey, David today.

Luke Gillespie: What was him?

Athena Simpson: Oh, yeah, I was going to ask where he is. thought he was going to be joining Buyers Club in these calls.

AcquiMatch Team: Yes. What do put him on? I was calling it. Um.

Athena Simpson: Okay. Um, cool. Is he going to enjoy these two?

Luke Gillespie: Cool for the rest, maybe even for the rest of the week, just keep him doing his training because we're we we're overloading him with a lot of calls to be listening to.

Athena Simpson: So he's got to use his time for that. Yeah, it's like 22 hours of calls.

Luke Gillespie: Yeah. He's good though. Definitely smart and he's ambitious and wants to work hard.

Athena Simpson: So he'll be fun. Yeah, I love that after all that too. He's like, how do we call David?

Luke Gillespie: I'm like, . Okay, David is. I was like, thank God I was gonna be so hard for me.

AcquiMatch Team: I was like, it's just so funny.

Athena Simpson: I was like making such a big point like after Ryan pointed it out.

AcquiMatch Team: like, let's call it by the right name, you know.

Athena Simpson: Okay, well, Just to get through that one. was a little trying to like fill the time.

Luke Gillespie: You know, good. It went well.

AcquiMatch Team: Paulie was very talkative.

Luke Gillespie: Stephen Paulie, your lifesavers.

AcquiMatch Team: Yeah, that's so true. Let's bring him on when you need someone to talk like.

Luke Gillespie: Yeah.

Athena Simpson: I love wedding. I'm like, I can see that they'll be so great for a wedding related. Like just their temperament and stuff, you know, like I can see Paulie not even getting phased with like crazy brides. Yeah.

Luke Gillespie: And you started connecting the dots. Before presenting this business, even after I didn't even know that they liked weddings and Steve and Paulie had experience in like a kind of catering, similar industries.

Athena Simpson: And you are connecting those dots. like, Oh, yeah, this excites them. So that's awesome. Well, and they said they wanted to get their daughter involved in whatever business that they bought. So I knew she. It was in marketing, so I'm like, and events, amazing, you know? So you see how that all works when you get them excited about like, uh, why they are a good fit for the business too. And it's just like, Hey, they're probably going to be more successful if they're actually excited about it. And they feel confident about it. But like Paulie saying, like, I'm not even worried about the seller called, like, are you serious?

Luke Gillespie: This is the same woman that it took us six months to get her to sign an NDA. You know, that's cool. Yeah. And I love the way Paulie talks about the broker. wants to say on the broker didn't know anything. she's like, she was really nice, like a really nice girl. And I was going to say that too. I think I told you guys about this in the interview calls. This brokerage is this hip new tech startup, like they're in San Francisco. So the, you know, tech startup, they're trying to do things differently. And just this SF girl. She's super nice.

Athena Simpson: But yeah, she doesn't know much about the business. Which broker does that?

Luke Gillespie: Um, it's cold and pull it up right now. Where is it? Is on I can't remember the name. Let me see—OpenFair. You just look at this website and you can see it's like a tech startup, probably venture-backed for sure. Um, so I haven't updated you guys on the conversation that I had with baton.

Athena Simpson: Did I? Like his valuation and Like they got money right you were telling us about that last week 15 million they've gotten in funding But he told me the stat that like I haven't been able to get out of my house Oh, yeah, did update you because of the buying thing. I don't think they're right because I've done like another hour of research and the real estate board of florida views a business as a property oh yeah so i'm just trying to find like i don't know i need to i'm gonna reach back out to him and ask him like see he's saying securities but it's like it's not a security it's a business which the real estate licensing body in florida views as a property it's an entity so it's interesting but um he was like you know only 20% of businesses that want to sell sell the only 2% of people that say they want to buy a business actually buy a business if for us that's that's status wild though like or say one more time only 20% of businesses that want to sell sell but only 2% of people that say they want to buy a business actually do

AcquiMatch Team: That was, that was what he said, interesting.

Athena Simpson: I said this out to multiple people now and they're like, Oh my God, that checks out.

AcquiMatch Team: And I'm like, well, no, they answered that actually sooner.

Athena Simpson: But people that pay us, like that, that is a commitment to buy, you know, like there's how many other people that come and they're like, Oh, right now or I'm going to do this myself or what, you know, it's like one foot in, but they're not willing to put money behind it.

Luke Gillespie: Yep.

AcquiMatch Team: Okay. So people just say they want to buy one, only 2% actually do.

Athena Simpson: Yeah. And I was on the phone with Wendy the other day and she's like, Oh my God, she's like, Yeah, she's like, that means I need to speak to 1,250 people next year to get 25 deals done. And like, so everybody that is on, know, that I mentioned this stat to and they're like, that checks out, because there was a part of me that was like, technically, like 33% of our original clients have closed, you know, out of the first three. But if we compare that to like the actual numbers that are happening out there, it's exceptionally higher. And hopefully one of the things I was going to ask you about was Justin's deal.

ACTION ITEM
Call Justin's seller tmrw, update Justin on situation

Athena Simpson: Hopefully we can get Justin's deal over the line. I hope so.

AcquiMatch Team: The seller canceled his call with me today. With a second time so. I got to get a little more aggressive with email of trying to getting them on the phone.

Athena Simpson: Unless you know that you're trying to like sort this. to deal out. Maybe he's canceling because he's actually wanted to keep the deal going with Justin. Will you let Justin know?

AcquiMatch Team: No, it was just this afternoon. I haven't talked to him. I was just thinking, I was going to run it by you, honestly, before I responded. My claim was that I'm just going to say, Hey, you know, the reason I want I want to do a call is that I spoke him with Justin. He told me he's still a eager and, you know, doing a deal with you. So wanted to just talk with you and get your thoughts on what was going on. That's pretty much it.

Athena Simpson: Yeah, maybe check in with Justin and see if sellers come back online for his deal or not. Like maybe he's canceling on it because he got in touch about speaking to other buyers. So if the thing with Justin is like, he's not wanting to throw that out. Maybe he's worried about speaking to you.

AcquiMatch Team: Yeah, okay. So yeah, I'm gonna send him that message and to let him know that's that's what I want to talk about and then I'll see if I can get him on but I thought maybe he would put two and two together. He's probably going to ask me about this deal. I mean, I'm surprised he didn't want to get on the phone. Getting him to this point, it was very easy. didn't he showed up for all the calls. He never blew me off. So this is the fact these blow me off two weeks in a row is unusual. So what we won't know until I speak to him. So I'll send an email explaining what I want, what I want to know. I'll get on a call.

Athena Simpson: Do you have his number?

AcquiMatch Team: Yeah, I tried calling him too.

Athena Simpson: Not today, necessarily, but tomorrow. And then you can say like, hey, you know, been chatting with Justin would love to just get an update on where you're at, see how I can support you. I'm going to try to give you a call tomorrow, you know, it's just like maybe, but I would I would almost just try to get him on the phone and okay, I can do that because sometimes the schedule call it's easier to like avoid it rather than you just being like, hey, like talk me through it, like, how can I help?

AcquiMatch Team: Got it, I'll do that tomorrow.

Athena Simpson: Worth it. mean, if we can get, it's so close, it seems so silly for it to fall apart at this point. 100%. Yeah. But yet another reason not to let people go to purchase agreement before LOI because like how much money is. and time is just an investment into all of this. Before he's even done due diligence.

AcquiMatch Team: Yeah, there's a lot of stuff I'm learning through this. know, all the processes, I mean, that's part of it, right? You know, Jason, this whole thing went to Tariq now. I mean, Jason had a call yesterday and he's like, man, and I kind of feel like he's like, obviously it's easier to say now, but I feel like we should have pressured him harder up at the financials earlier in the process. And I was like, yeah, of course I have that feeling too, but we did press him and he kept saying, I'm a CPA. He kept and we were both laughing. He's like, he just kept dodging us and saying, I'm a CPA. Yeah, he kept. I mean, I'm now looking at it's like you didn't even you don't even have basic financial concepts. You don't even It makes me want to go back to the very first time he pushed back against me And he kind of I was feeling a little bit stupid because he got he like threw at my face and said you just need to you know You just need this and this if anyone can't figure it out. I've questioned I questioned your ability That's what he said to me. I was like I kind of I got a lot of them take control there And so now I look back. I'm like, no, he just didn't he was scared And he didn't know what he was talking about and he kept hiding behind this. I'm in the CPA thing Now now I'm like, I should have put that together and pushed him harder, you know, so It's a learning experience I I would have faltered under that when somebody's like I'm a CPA like show me if you actually have a buyer, you know Like he he he was tough cookie and like and then we get this is why we got an LOI before

Athena Simpson: or purchasing. Imagine he pushed for a purchase agreement. Like went through all that drawing up a purchase agreement only to be like, Oh, , like the financials are in the state for anybody to be able to use them. So, but now, you know, and I've heard this time and time it's like if they're if they're digging in their heels and they don't So, yeah, good luck selling your business. We're trying to offer you a solution. Nobody else is going to do. Yeah, I was thinking about this, for future, if we were ever a broker, to just have like a specialty or a couple specialty bookkeepers that we could just fly into somebody's business to like do this , right? Like, how many more good businesses would we be able to scoop up just by having a resource already built in to get the financials where we want them to be.

AcquiMatch Team: Yeah. Yeah, this is a good guinea pig to potentially do that with.

Athena Simpson: Right, yeah, Jason doesn't want it and we believe it's a good business, you know, like can we find somebody that would be able to like go into the office and do this, get those financials in a good place and sell the business, you know, and like is that what it takes? Because lot of burgers aren't, they just take the financials that are given to them by the owners and like how many, how much more complicated are you making this, much money are you leaving on the table because you're just not doing a transfer of financial statements into something that people can use. Yeah, yeah, I don't think you did anything wrong, Brian, like I would have done the same thing but like it's a learning now and now you have a little bit more confidence to push back because you've seen once on the other side of somebody protesting that they are a CPA, I've never had that before, I would buckle up. under that too, because as much as I read this and do tax strategy and everything, it's such a complicated process.

AcquiMatch Team: So like, so when I ran the car rental company, man, that was such an experience, because essentially what I was doing as I was calculating risk every day, because I'm essentially everyone I would rent a car, I was essentially giving them alone, because they were just giving me a down payment and a deposit and I was giving them the $50,000 vehicle, know, and then I had to learn the hard way with like stolen vehicles, police chases, you know, you know, people I rented to regularly, they went to jail, they dealt drugs, they had boyfriend girlfriends stolen cars, like I had, and then this was my problem. And then I was spending my time trying to get these vehicles, talking to the police, spot, don't talk, drive to tow yards, going to body shops, checking the, and I was doing that instead of running the my business. And so every situation, something bad happened to me. I got good at like vetting everyone that wanted to rent a car and be like, no, not you. Like, I know what could go wrong here. I'm not even gonna write. And then as I did that, I drove my expenses, I brought my expenses down tremendously and I freed up my headspace. And I was just focusing on that. And that will be the same with this, right? It's just like, that's why a lot of times I talk about Luke, I'm like, at the funnel, when we are picking these businesses, it will make or break how much time we're spending if we pick the wrong business to push forward or the right business, right? That's why all the vetting, the video is so important, because it puts, it sets up our clients for success, right? so we learn these things, we can filter out all these problems, which ends up saving

Luke Gillespie: Pushing back to Jason and you guys kind of just are accepting it as a loss And I feel like Terry's clearly shown that he's committed and I don't know if he's necessarily lying about anything I don't think that's it I think he's just a stubborn guy to work with and I feel like if you can coast Jason to You know use the relationship He's built up with Tariq and tell him like look at like it's gonna be impossible We I literally can't get the loan to do this deal if you don't do this accounting work unless you want to give me 90% seller financing or else and then Jason also just needs to explain to Tariq like you can't sell your business to anyone If you don't do this like not to me not to the private equity company not to A broker listed on the market business tell Jason to tell him how like oh if you think you're gonna go to a broker And do this and the broker is gonna do all the accounting for you Well then the broker is gonna take this person out of your purchase price, right? Like I feel like I don't know I'm just I'm don't feel as pessimistic as you and Jason do but obviously you guys are a lot more tapped into it than I am but I think you guys should be a little more positive and I think you know these things are very dramatic like with Joe and Jason every time something happens like like Pino just pushes back on Joe for like two financial statements and Joe's ready to divorce Pino he's ready to dump him and move on to the next his next date like it seems like how immature I was like dating girls in college or something like that's I think everyone just really dramatic I I just wanted to say I feel like we could be more optimistic about Jason's deal I think we shouldn't give up yet like you should try to coach Jason to say that it there's there's still a chance and I like the two-week idea you know Tariq better than me and yeah I was listening to those calls but Ryan I'm a CPA man if you can't figure out these numbers I doubt who you are working what to do is what—what's his nationality, Tariq?

Luke Gillespie: Tariq. Tariq. The name sounds yeah He definitely has a Middle Eastern accent. Yeah.

Athena Simpson: Um, well, depending on, yeah, I did a lot of work in the Middle East and they definitely put things back on you. They're calling your credibility of the question. Interesting.

Luke Gillespie: I love that.

Athena Simpson: I, you know, there's an element of more of these off markets we're going to do the more we're going to get clear on like where people fall down on their own. And that's why I think like I, you know, I keep talking about the program. We're going to have to move into that, right? Because it's like, if we leave clients to do things on their own directly with the seller, how much time are we investing behind them rather than facilitating the conversation? Like how much quicker and easier would it be if we were facilitating the conversation rather than behind it?

Luke Gillespie: Yeah.

Athena Simpson: You know what I mean? Like, so the more of the we do, we're going to see where it just just like on market, like we're we're so dialed in on like what they need to do at what point. So we're going to learn more of like what are people falling down on and particularly like they don't have a broker educating the seller or working with the seller or incentivize to get the clothes and the seller has no skin in the game.

Luke Gillespie: You're right.

Athena Simpson: So apart from their time right they've invested into that and started doing that but like you know there's there's something to be said when you have skin in the game. So it'll be interesting to keep exploring that. think it doesn't sound like Ryan's giving up on it. I think the play is good like give Tariq some time to think about it and how he's going to try to sell from here, you know.

AcquiMatch Team: Yeah, yeah it's more than you mainly like the The rationality, we have it. It's more of that we're dealing with a 73 year old stubborn guy and that's, that's where we have to meet him, you know, because we can't force him to do this. Um, so we're without it. Yeah, some of that age we have to work with him, no matter what is kind of his thing is. So we'll see, we'll see what happens.

Athena Simpson: Yeah. Cool, I'll give you a few updates and then, um, I'll, I'll over to you guys. Um, so the secret guests on Thursday's—Renan. Um, who did the $8 million dollar finance deal nearly went bankrupt last year has had to go back into his W-2 with the business is still surviving and the seller even put 300,000 back into the business to keep it from going under. Yeah, it's wild. So, um, I just caught up with him today. He went back to his W-2 because he was literally. You're to have to put his house on the market. He's got—

Athena Simpson: Oh, I'll switch topics and when he comes back on, I'll pick up the Renan thing because this is more for you anyway. So I caught up with Dave Collinson today. Dave Collinson is the guy that does off-market sourcing and he was the one that Renan mentioned on the same episode. Dave and I have been dancing together, trying to figure out how to work together. tried to tag team on a client where I offered the consultant thing. It didn't work. But I keep sending people his way that like don't mean first-time buyer. for kind of help, here's Luke. Because like people that come to me and are just like, I just want off-market leads. like, we're not your people, so I'm like, go talk to Dave. So, hey, Luke.

Athena Simpson: Okay, So I was just updating Ryan on a conversation with Dave Collinson, who does off-market sourcing only. He actually was mentioned on the same podcast with Renan, like, use Dave and knows us and Renan mentioned both of us. Dave, his ideal buyer is somebody doing a rollup. He's like, we find a bunch of these like tiny businesses or somebody that actually knows what they're doing because they do know advisory or support throughout the process. Like, they literally just source off-market leads. Well, before it didn't make sense, I was like, God, if you have surplus, like, I would love to look at him, but his model was like a five, four, three, two, one success fee on the purchase price. And I was like, well, we couldn't do anything like that, because our model is completely different. So, now he's like, I've got hundreds of off market leads that we can't do anything with. You know, these are people that want to sell, but they're not a match for our clients and that other stuff. So he's like, trialing this new model where he charges for an introduction to the lead so that it's like, you're kind of locking that in until you make a decision on it. And then he's like, I'm open to discussing what kind of success fee there would be. And I was like, well, maybe I can put that in front of my team and have them look at all the leads that you have, and then, you know, we'll work out something where if we close on it, we'll share some of the success fee with you. But it can't be like a percentage based thing because we just don't do that. But I'm like, we could probably provide volume if this works and you find things that are interesting. So he was showing me the list and he's got a bunch in like Texas and Florida, New York. So thought that might be, I don't think he has anything in Oklahoma or any of the markets that we're looking in, but it could be a good trial to see if he does genuinely find good leads. They just don't know how structuring works. And then he's like, you know, these these owners, they want six X on EBITDA. I was like, do you even know how to determine SDE and like, you know, so I think without us revealing how we vet and how we look at deals, like, I don't know if he really understands how deals are structured or businesses are valued. I think he's really good at finding owners that want to sell.

Luke Gillespie: Interesting. So, I mean, from the sound of it, that would basically just be like another off market channel for us. instead of MailShake, now, We also have this guy and it would basically just go through the same off market process.

Athena Simpson: Yeah, or instead of the Facebook ads guy that didn't really bring us any genuinely good leads, Dave's list, we'd have to, we're sort of thinking of like a one, two, where we'll pay to have a conversation with somebody, like a smaller fee. If we like it, we want to put it in front of a client, then we'll pay a little bit bigger of a fee and then that locks it in. So he's taking it off his list that he has access to other people. And then like split some of the success fee, but it could, you know, if it works well, then we might even be able to plug him into other searches because I think what's he's struggling with is finding people that will close and finding people that know how to talk to owners and know how to get their valuation considerations in line with reality from like where they're, you know, So it's the owner wants to sell what happens next his team's not really good at that and then the client city's been taking on in the past to have no idea what to do with it.

Luke Gillespie: Yeah, and that's Ryan's strong. So he's dealt with the CPAs.

Athena Simpson: Ryan's got. So that's update number one. Does that sound like something you guys would like to explore?

AcquiMatch Team: Yeah, yeah.

Luke Gillespie: For sure.

AcquiMatch Team: Anything we can get with off market is just like. Couldn't be either like good leads or a good experience to get us closer to the direction we want to get which is more off market experience volume. Yeah.

Luke Gillespie: And this guy does big deals right Athena?

Athena Simpson: No, this is a different one actually. So that Andre guy, I actually was on a sales call with somebody that worked with him. And he's like, yeah, deal flow is really bad. I was like, okay, the , there's all these guys out there that are like off-market sorcerers and like art deal flows much better than a lot of these people and I'm feeling like we need to do better and like we don't want to do better because we know like if clients have like one thing to work on a week then they're kind of like slow down and that's a good place for them to be. So anyways, yeah, no this is Dave Collinson and he gets a bunch of leads but it's like these are owners that have put their hands up and maybe answered a few of the vetting questions, you know, so that's the state that they're in is like they know what their revenue is they've done an initial call with the owner to get a profile about them why they want to sell some information about the business but that's it. But it's more than you might get from like the Facebook ads where somebody's like I want to sell and it's like here's a company name and nothing. But it means that there would be fees involved from our side. We have to like compensate Dave and it would cut into our fees, but you know, like Brian said, having more at bats for us as well as our clients and off-market leads is a great opportunity. And who knows? Maybe it might be a really great relationship that we can capitalize on and restructure in the future. So Dave's like, I'm just learning to be more open, you know, and I'm like, I don't see us as being competitive, especially because he doesn't want to go near first-time buyers and we don't want to go near roll-up people, right? But he does something that's good and has access and we might be able to use that.

Luke Gillespie: Okay.

AcquiMatch Team: Remember the coaching guy that you referred to me through email?

Athena Simpson: Oh, yeah.

AcquiMatch Team: Yeah. That went pretty well. I was super well and surprisingly well. business, it looks like it's pretty cool. The only thing is that he's Canadian and he's like a Canadian business. Even though a lot of the primary customers are US based, so that's the only thing with lending. would have to see if there's a lender who would touch it or if there's something they could do there to make it eligible for an SBA loan.

Athena Simpson: Don't let that, I mean if it's a solid business, we can find other, what's the SDE numbers?

AcquiMatch Team: 1.1 million.

Athena Simpson: Do you know how much he wants for it?

ACTION ITEM
Review financials for coaching business

AcquiMatch Team: No I haven't gotten there yet.

Athena Simpson: Is it him? Is he the face of the business or is it like generic coaching business?

AcquiMatch Team: He's the face, but I haven't gotten, I only got as far as like understand if I think it's a good business I do and now I'm I'd want to see financials and what she just sent me today and so now I'm going to review financials and I may even ask him to give me like a like a temporary user ID for his course and just log in and understand what the business is and then then I'll do the next call I'll get I'll get through everything I'll ask all the right questions but yeah I won't I won't bring that up but I was gonna try to see get with a lender make a Wendy or something like that hey what do you think of the something like this I'm pretty positive SBA can't buy a Canadian businesses but that's not that they're like there's other funding sources available

Athena Simpson: if it's a good business. So that's what we need to determine first is like, what?

AcquiMatch Team: Right.

Athena Simpson: My bigger question is like, could the business survive without him?

AcquiMatch Team: Oh, sure, that's, of course, that's the first thing. Absolutely.

Athena Simpson: if it can, and it's doing that kind of revenue, is it remote online business?

AcquiMatch Team: Yeah.

Athena Simpson: Yeah, if it's not for one of our clients, we can find someone and there's plenty of people looking for businesses in Canada. You can do it with conventional funding and or private lenders would also fund something like that. I have those kinds of resources, so.

AcquiMatch Team: Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I mean, he has, I think it's like 40 employees remote based, so it's a big operation. It's not just like him doing it. His face is on the business and he's involved, but if he gives me access to. what he has, and I start looking through it, I'll be able to kind of understand how reliant is on him. So that'll be the next steps. I'm going to do that next.

Athena Simpson: Nice. Have you, I'm imagining you came across these kinds of businesses that empower for a person?

AcquiMatch Team: All the time.

Athena Simpson: Yeah, so you have a good sense.

AcquiMatch Team: Yeah, because internet businesses, they can be one man shows, right? That's the beauty about internet based businesses that you can do it that way. So we'll figure that out.

Athena Simpson: But if it's something that could be transferred, like maybe that's something we work. You know, I'm always thinking about that. Like when it's a good business and there's a few tweaks that someone needs to make to be able to make it sellable, how are we supporting them, or like where are we directing them? How are we leaving them better than we found them? Which is one of our values, but also , if he's like the face of it, we work with him, give him some homework, maybe like monthly check-ins to see how he's doing to get his face off of it, right? And then when he's ready to sell, it's like, we're right there and we have something far more valuable than it was when they originally came to us.

AcquiMatch Team: And they trust us because he helped him. Right, yeah. Well, sometimes he's just that. And I usually like to plant the seed early. So I was going, tell me about this, and then I started going and I'm do you have to do that yourself? Like, so he's like, why do this and this? like, do you have to or is it, you know? Well, I choose to, because I like it. I like doing that. Okay, I got you. Did they expect you, do the clients expect you to be there, right? So I kind of, and he kind of like sees where I'm going. like, he starts to start, well, we start talking about it. So once I actually look at the business, I'll go a little bit harder on that kind of stuff. And then usually, not all of always. But like, if they want an astronomical price, I'll kind of be like, you got to come back down to earth, your type, your face is tied to this business, your brand type, you can't walk away and expect it to keep doing this. So like, you know, that's one thing that needs to change. And no matter if you change all that today, that doesn't do anything, because the last three years, your face was involved. So you can't do that today. You can't be done.

Athena Simpson: Right?

AcquiMatch Team: so if you does want a crazy multiple, that's something I kind of used to bring him back down. We'll see what we'll see kind of what he's interested in. What he made it sound like he doesn't want anything crazy. But also, he said like, he used the word SaaS and he used the word AI lot.

Athena Simpson: And I was like, oh, that they think they're going to get a hundred X. Why does he want to sell?

AcquiMatch Team: He said he's a builder. He's like, I'm a builder. like building things. I've built this thing. And it's a 40. Person company and I'm like doing lot of meetings and team management and I don't that's not my thing Got it common common To hear that amongst like the internet-based business What kind of coaching? It's real if they it's about um, it's mortgage loans.

Athena Simpson: Yeah, kidding me. Oh my god Yeah, this is Andrew written all over it doesn't it Yeah, and you need to worry about SBA that much and you already said he's open to not using SBA So Yeah Yeah, although he was talking about some smaller business This one's gonna this is gonna be you know, it's gonna be easily four to five million yeah, but because because you know like build in a high amount of seller financing Right like and the thing is like if he did a high amount of seller financing and then after two years of andrew running it in the us he could get a new SBA loan to pull it into the U.S., right?

AcquiMatch Team: Yeah, that's what I was thinking. was like, it's like, you can make this a U.S.-based business. He's just a Canadian guy. It's an online business with majority of the clients in the U.S. That's why I wanted to talk to one. He's like, do know any quick ways around this, right? He can make this a U.S.-based business, so it's easier to sell. may be a trip here, I don't know.

Athena Simpson: That's a good, good point. I think, yeah, so they, so SBA is like a U.S. government tax-based business. You know, they're looking at the tax returns, maybe for Canada. Good. Yeah, good. with Wendy, but even still, if he's like, I want out now, then be like, okay, well, we can do seller finance for the first two years, at which point, as long as we hit these kinds of numbers and you've successfully handed over your likelihood, then we'll be able to access government funding and, like, get you completely out on a balloon. Because when you run a business for two years successfully, right, then you can, you can do SBA. And by that point, it'll have been in the U.S. that long, too.

AcquiMatch Team: Yeah.

Athena Simpson: I can't believe it's real estate. Oh my God. It's like, come on. Oh, that's cool. Good. Okay. Cool. Any more on that one? I'll finish the Renan stuff and any other updates or things you guys want to chat through?

AcquiMatch Team: I can run through the client, the clients, but what do you prefer?

Athena Simpson: I'll just I'll just wrap up the Renan conversation because Luke dropped off. So, um, where was I at? Renan had to get a W-2. He was like looking at like losing his house and he has kids and a wife. And he's like, I'm not giving up my house. So he couldn't get a job because everybody knew his story and he was a flight risk. So he had to commit to three years with his old company to get his job back. So he's like running this business with his business partner, potentially raising money for like other acquisitions, but he's committed to being a medical sales rep again for three years.

Luke Gillespie: Who's Renan like it?

Athena Simpson: Renan is the one that did the podcast on acquiring minds that got us like a hundred frickin leads from it. So he did a $8 million 100% seller finance deal.

Luke Gillespie: Wow. So then how is his house up for grabs? Did he give it as collateral to the seller?

Athena Simpson: Yeah, so like no seller is going to have a lawyer that's not going to make you do a PG if you're doing a hundred percent seller financing, right?

Luke Gillespie: Like at least we hope not. this is Sellers putting their entire likelihood on the line.

Athena Simpson: So yeah, Renan put a P, even though it's 100% seller financing, he put a personal guarantee on it. So he was facing bankruptcy and losing his house. And I don't know when you dropped off, but the seller even put 300k back into the business to help them. Like he hasn't been making seller payments for a while. Sellers put 300k into like cover payroll and stuff to get him back on track.

Luke Gillespie: The whole thing is just wild.

Athena Simpson: So I called him and I was like, my clients are asking to hear from somebody who's like, boss this in a month, you know, you're in a year and a half and he's like two years into it.

Luke Gillespie: He's like, I will be vulnerable. I will share. I will talk about all the things I wish I knew before.

Athena Simpson: But he's like, the only thing is like, I can't commit to the time because now that I'm back in my w two, if a surgeon and they need support, I gotta do that, you know? He's like, so right now, it looks like I can do it, but I might not be able to last minute. And he's like, if that's too much of a problem for you, let me know. And I was like, well, Matthias dropped, and I'm navigating all that, but he's kind of in my not favorite people list right now. And I would love to not be making recommendations and how we get this all sorted out. So just FYI, Ryan, those are the conversations on referrals and stuff has kind of come to a standstill. So let's stick to the lenders that we like. So yeah, but yeah, Matthias just canceled like on Friday and I was like, okay, we have no one scheduled for Thursday. And like, I want to talk to on and see if he'd be up for it.

Luke Gillespie: So he's like, actually, this is a good week. have a full team, my Thursday was wide open right now.

Athena Simpson: So yeah, so hopefully he can go.

Luke Gillespie: Is he the guy who outsourced his sales?

Athena Simpson: No, no, no, no, no. Um, none like the thing I love about him is he digs his heels in. Like, and he tastes big swings and just pulls off miraculous things and his ability to like Mobilize people, his sales ability, like his relationship building, like he's exceptional. Which is why I think he's one of the only people on the planet. They can pull off an $8 million or 100% seller financing deal and get the seller to put money back into it. Like, what, uh, yeah, that's crazy. Yeah. So, um, yeah, he's a, I really hope he came going on Thursday because I think he's exceptional and hopefully won't scare the out of people. but also what a value add that they're not going to get anywhere else. getting the behind the scenes real look into one of the like poster children of Cody Sanchez. Who by the way, when Renan was like really struggling reached out to her. Do you know what page in her new book, like how long it took before she mentioned Renan her little poster child for her 100% seller financing tirades that she goes on? How many pages before you think she mentioned him?

AcquiMatch Team: I didn't know she has a book.

Athena Simpson: Yeah, I came out like late last year, page five. And then she puts his face all over everything, talks about how he did it, talks about her success story of him being in the community.

Luke Gillespie: Renan reaches out to her and is like, I'm really struggling. I could use her help and she didn't even pick up the phone to talk to him.

AcquiMatch Team: And she she didn't return his call or anything.

Athena Simpson: no. It's one of the reasons why I have such a Negative feeling towards her because I watched all that go down. I'm like, I have seen you use him to your own benefit so many times and taught him around as your little poster child. And like, your book, it's page five before you mentioned him is like how you're selling the dream to everybody else. And he reaches out to you and he's like in dire straights and not in a good mental health place either. And she didn't even pick up the phone or offer to help.

Luke Gillespie: I like the issues and she's raising awareness of buying a business but she's she's got a mastermind for sales so she's not selling the reality of it and then you get into the mastermind and it doesn't help you actually buy a business you know yeah and like pushing that fake lifestyle 200k cash flow absentee yeah what business have either of you looked at that has those characteristics yeah yeah it's true there's 3,000 deals in our pipeline has a single one at an absentee business this is like owner that's gonna cash flow at least 200 after that service anyways um yeah Ryan do you you have a hard stop at five

AcquiMatch Team: no

Luke Gillespie: okay i won't i won't keep you guys too late

Athena Simpson: How so gills top of mind, obviously, because he hasn't had a deal in a while.

Luke Gillespie: So how's that look, and I got a lot of things that are hot right now for him. Our IT, our pivot into the IT search is already showing up some results. I have a broker call scheduled tomorrow for an IT business. Yeah, it's, it's in Arizona, I believe, but the broker says it could be run remotely. I have another IT business that's hot. It's hot on my hands. It's the broker told me, yeah, you could probably run it remote. But he said, if you have a similar company in the other state, but I said, what about an experienced IT individual? So I'm waiting to hear back from that. But that's another kind of hot deal I have. And then I also have a clothing manufacturer in New York area. They manufacture like the puffy winter jackets, you know, those like furry jackets and the down jackets, things like that. The broker told me he's gonna schedule a call at my link at the end of today. Haven't seen him schedule yet, but I talked to him this morning. He said he'll schedule it. I think this guy's pretty responsible. responsive. So I have those three for Gil. I'm pretty sure that's what I have for him right now. Yeah, those three is what I have for Gil. And I reached out again for the pet company. The broker hasn't responded. Yeah, so I'm still going to keep pushing on that.

Athena Simpson: Okay, cool. The IT business, sorry, do you have a broker call scheduled?

Luke Gillespie: How far away are we from a write-up on the IT ones? I have it at tomorrow, 2.30 my time, 4.30 p.m. time. if the call goes well, I could just turn it into a write-up immediately after.

Athena Simpson: Okay, cool. He shows up to every Buyers Club call. So that's not calling on him and talking about it. It's like, oh, it's been a couple weeks since he've had a deal. You know, like it's also a PR thing because he's so active on the Buyers Club.

Luke Gillespie: So not that all of our clients don't deserve as much deal flow as possible.

Athena Simpson: But it's just so you know, that's why he's of mine because he's there and now I'm starting to call on people. If I'm not calling on him, it's going to look weird.

Luke Gillespie: Gotcha. Yeah, good point. Yeah, he's he's been number one right now. So, yeah, and especially getting that even we'll pick up you'll feel for him or lies as well. So, yeah, I'm should get it right up tomorrow. If not, I'm he's my number one priority right now, I'm in Jason. So, yeah.

Athena Simpson: Well, Dave's list had a lot in New York and also IT services.

Luke Gillespie: that's good.

Athena Simpson: Cool. How about any any sign of life from Jenny or Alex?

AcquiMatch Team: No, Alex said that she's come out of the hospital. She said that they had to remove fluid from her lung and that she's sleeping a lot. So, I said, you know, you know, glad to hear your own resting. I didn't even feel like it was appropriate to say anything else at that time, you know, so we'll wait on that to see.

Athena Simpson: Okay, I'll follow up with her.

AcquiMatch Team: JJ, nothing. I am really surprised. I'm like, what is going on? I mean, it must something be something personal with her because she's never not responded this long before. I mean, it's the last communication you have. We were supposed to talk about her putting that an offer and modeling out the power washing business. So she had reached back and said, broker rejected my LOI for the roofing business. And she was waiting on some more financials for the power washing business. like, hey, let's talk about that. Let me know when you get it. No response. I followed up with her, no response. I sent her a message about the SBA, no response. And I followed up and just say, hey, just following up over everything's okay.

ACTION ITEM
Text Jenny to check if everything ok

AcquiMatch Team: I said, checking it. My last most hope ball is well with you. looking forward to hearing from you. That was almost a week ago.

Athena Simpson: Maybe send a text and just be like, hey, we're worried about you. Everything okay?

AcquiMatch Team: Okay.

Athena Simpson: Wild.

AcquiMatch Team: Yeah.

Athena Simpson: three out of the four CT members that we have, clients that we have, like, I feel like the problem children, Jenny, Brian, and Alex all come from Cody's community.

Luke Gillespie: Wow.

AcquiMatch Team: Yeah.

Athena Simpson: That's it. Jason. And also, but, you know, just like looking at the differences and how people are, this is Stephen Polly also I met there too, but they were one of the original, because like the earlier ones, when I was really active in the community, I saw how people were and interacted with them. then like, I chose the good ones, you know, whereas now I'm so, I'm not involved in the community so people are just finding us and reaching out, you know.

Luke Gillespie: Yeah. Interesting.

AcquiMatch Team: I can see how, I can see how Brian and I are just like, I mean, there's like no coaching those two, they're just like all of us. But JJ, I thought she was actually doing pretty good. I'm, you know, like, I thought she was doing pretty good. The only thing is just been this thing with the SBA. It's really just been this one thing. Unless it's not a DUI. Is it something more serious? I don't know, you know.

Athena Simpson: Well, if she is, she can't get over the hump of even getting a pre-qualification. She's not getting it funding. You know, like, how are you planning on buying the business?

AcquiMatch Team: Right.

Athena Simpson: A prequal call doesn’t report to the SBA network. It's just somebody having a conversation with you, you know? I can't understand it. I would send her a text and just be like, hey, we're all worried about you. Everything okay?

AcquiMatch Team: Yeah, I will.

Athena Simpson: Cool. Awesome. Any other client updates you want to give? know I know where Jason, Joe are at. Moving on, talked about Andrew.

Luke Gillespie: Andrew is doing a broker call tomorrow morning for an online real estate marketing business that he's really excited about.

Athena Simpson: Yes. Ah! Nice work! Online and real estate! It's awesome.

Luke Gillespie: Yeah.

Athena Simpson: the numbers check out for him?

Luke Gillespie: Um, like, like, uh, 200k SD for him?

Athena Simpson: After debt service?

ACTION ITEM
Complete write-ups - Andrew's online RE mktg biz, Jason's SaaS biz

Luke Gillespie: Yes, yes, to 190k SD for him after Yeah. At asking price, it's $207,000.

AcquiMatch Team: Oh, a few others too for him that we're gonna get out, right?

Luke Gillespie: I'm gonna finish a write-up forum right after this call. gonna send it to you Ryan to add your notes to the online business. I found another real estate marketing SaaS business that we had at March for Jason, but I'm gonna push it for Andrew just because anything real estate online should probably go to Andrew. It's one of my favorite brokers I already told him. Let's get on my call tomorrow. Like, he just gave me the sim. called him. I said, get on a call tomorrow. He hasn't responded yet, but this guy's good.

Athena Simpson: He'll get back to me.

Luke Gillespie: So, hopefully that will turn into something. I would say for those ones that are more like neutral, like don't even mention if it's Andrew or Jason, just like I have a iron mine and then we can always decide at the time that we want to give it to. Okay.

AcquiMatch Team: Thanks.

Luke Gillespie: All right. Because I am doing a call for a SaaS business tomorrow, that's like one hour a week, apparently all automated and going to bring an 80K after debt service for Jason. And so hopefully if that turns into a write up, we won't have to like scramble this real estate SaaS business and do a write up for Jason and we could get it to Andrew. But yeah.

AcquiMatch Team: Yeah. Yeah. just never know. Like I hate to like hit age with three write ups in week and then the next two weeks were scrambling for Jason, like if we hit him with one or two, then like just keep that other one bit. Wait, are we sure we have something for Jason and if not, use it for Jason.

Athena Simpson: And Jason's okay on these like little 80K things.

AcquiMatch Team: Yeah.

Luke Gillespie: He's in T one an hour a week.

AcquiMatch Team: He's okay on some smart. our ones as long as it can be pretty bad. So got it.

Athena Simpson: Okay, cool. Awesome. Who else?

AcquiMatch Team: CM? CM, I did the write up for the beast Northeast business. So we're going to go over that tomorrow. So we have a lot of tomorrow. We're going to review that. Yeah, that's pretty much where we are there. Do you have like Luke, any on market stuff for him right now.

Luke Gillespie: I've been spending all my time on Gil, Chris, Jason Gil Andrew Jason.

AcquiMatch Team: Yeah, we deprioritize Chris when I got the off market right up for him so that Luke could just focus on what was necessary like Gil and stuff. So but once once Luke gets out those, can keep moving on Chris. But hopefully this one just call as well tomorrow and this will keep him pretty busy.

Athena Simpson: Okay, well, we got like a week and a half left in this very short month. So how are we Looking on minimums across everybody.

Luke Gillespie: We have two minimums for SPDL and CM and AH, all met. is going to get four by the end of today, probably probably five or six. Actually, actually, yeah, I scheduled another, I have another broken all for another online business for Andrew. So we really focused everything on Andrew. So yeah, he's going to get at least five writeups, probably. And then so Jason and Gil are still at zero right now. That's why we're scrambling to make them our number one. And then AA and JJ are both on pause and then JB as well. Cause he's too busy filled up with what he's doing and BH just hasn't been responding to Ryan.

Athena Simpson: So has JB green-lighted being paused or did we just make that call?

Luke Gillespie: No, it's not so much that he's been on pause. Just we've been focusing on these other clients much more.

AcquiMatch Team: Um, yeah, we're. So we're still looking for stuff for JB, deal full is slower. So it's not that he's on, on pause, but we don't really have anything for him right now. But I mean, I did, I mean, I guess this one doesn't really count as a write up, but I brought it back. I mean, I did all of that. You know, I called the brokers, like when we were short on them, I went out to the whole brokers. What do you guys have? Guy got back to me and said, Hey, you know that business you asked about? It's coming back. I said, send me the financial, send me the sim, send me everything you got. I put it all together. said, Joe, this business is coming back. I got it to him. And now he has a, he has a meeting with them at 10 o'clock in the morning tomorrow. And he said, if it goes well, he's gonna submit an LOI.

Athena Simpson: So that happened this month. Got it. So that I would count that as one, we brought it back. And that was down to you, not the broker reaching out to him directly. We need to be careful though, when we're just assuming that they don't like we've committed contractually to everything.

Luke Gillespie: different. Yeah, yeah.

AcquiMatch Team: So all right. So then just to summarize there, like just where we are right now, we need, we need Jason, we need GL, and we need to get JB one more.

Athena Simpson: And then everybody else is good.

Luke Gillespie: Yeah, Brian's just off in his own little land or you know, Brian, you know, he's a bad. He's a bad.

AcquiMatch Team: Yeah. Yeah, we just need to just keep getting them things like pretty much what we've been doing, you know, just like something comes around that looks like it could be somewhat of a bit pass it to him. I mean, he's and then just keep giving him those things. But here you go. He's kind of just in his own world doing his own thing. I've had I've already had two calls where I've tried to reel him back and be like, I need to respond at a time. We have to do it this way. And he's like, Ryan, thanks so much. You're doing a great job. will definitely do that. And then he doesn't talk to me for a week. I'm like, okay, so.

Athena Simpson: Just sure you log in Slack too, because I was, I was looking at the kind of projections in terms of new clients and workloads, that sort of thing. like, I think we need to have a couple of conversations at the six month mark. And BH, like preemptively, like, hey, you're not doing anything here, right? do you want to, because they're going to have to start paying 5k month after six months. like, I think if we talked at least a month or two before and be like, you've given this a shot, doesn't feel like a good bet. You know, so do you want us to cancel, or do you want us to, like, part ways and, or do you, are you genuinely wanting to do this because you're going to start investing even more money into the process. So on the Slack channel Jenny same thing it's like we can't give you any more deals until you do this thing but Brian there's you know I don't know where the conversation was left it's like hey Brian we can't keep sending you deals until we hear back from you and you work these other ones buddy like you know yeah so just making it clear in the communication just just think of that Ryan like if they were to come back and hold this accountable for anything if we've done have we proven that we've done everything we can to try to deliver for them oh my gosh yeah cool um awesome anyone else did you want to talk through anything else i don't want to question one task oh sorry keep going man you know the only other thing is like we got dl to those write-ups and we did row crantros for them and they seem like they're pretty adamant just like just moving forward and testing those out so that's good

AcquiMatch Team: I would say both of them are like I said this before both of them are not like I'm not thrilled about those businesses So I would really love if we can still get them something like solid they can be wow So that that's still how I feel about them. pretty I feel I'm pretty accurate on that like to make sure I Like well, like everybody's first month. I feel like they're having a good experience I still feel that they're they're good with what we did but if we can sink in one more that like Really attractive.

Athena Simpson: I mean, they're all they have a pretty good geographic location That's where I think we're at with them That's it Also something that I think You and Anka might want to tag team on in the setting the expectations with new clients is It can take some time for your market to warm up, right? So like in these initial ones We're gonna get things in front of you, but since for starting a bespoke search from scratch from a standing start. It takes us a little while to get the momentum. So some of the first ones are more for you to like get the calibration and get your practice and while the team, you know, ramps up. And especially with, I tell them the sales calls, like the on market can take sometimes months for us to get to that conversation. So just reiterating the points that I'm saying on the sales calls, so getting on to like remind them like, Hey, first couple are going to be calibration for you to test summer, direct it, some aren't. But it's a good opportunity for you to learn. And that also is while the team's like ramping up and warming up in your area. Because just reminded me, is like a personalized concierge You know, it's not like we're constantly searching your area. So, you know, it's a warm up phase or whatever. And then you reiterate that on the first call. then that way they don't feel disappointed if the deal flows a little slow or not exactly like thought because it's just like it.

AcquiMatch Team: It does, you know, like we take a little bit of a while to ramp up in a market. Yeah, yeah. I talked to a broker also, he's been doing this really like 13 years, something like that. He says, usually around middle February, that's, that's what he thinks things start to actually pick up. So we're, we're about there now. So he, he says, that's once people start finalizing their year, doing their tax returns and stuff, he's like people will start coming around. So hopefully that's coming as well. But anyways, I did tell them that. was like, know, I, I, like I said, I came in prepared for that call, like laughing about when you're giving them a Buyers Club and they, they kind of followed that. yeah, they're like, like, seems a little crazy. at the same time, it does look kind of interesting. And so I was like, do, do the call? Like, here's all the questions. What questions do you have? We thought it all through. Destin's pretty, he thinks through things pretty well. So he was like thinking Well, I like how he was thinking about it. was like, I could ask this and ask that and ask that. I was like, those are great questions. go there and do it and see how you feel. So they're going to put forward with that. So yeah.

Athena Simpson: Awesome. Yeah, and then it's overall a temperature check, too. So you can like sell the, we want you to go and have these first conversations come back, give us feedback so that we can refine the search even better, right? So it's like, as long as we're getting really good at managing our expectations up front, they won't be disappointed. And it'll take the pressure off of us, too, as opposed to like not seeing anything and then thinking they're going to get ordeals that are directed to their first month, you know?

AcquiMatch Team: Yeah, yeah. Gotcha.

Athena Simpson: Which I'm sure you're doing. I'm just trying to find you all some breathing space and take the pressure off little bit, too. So the more that we can just manage people's expectations at front and communicate things, you know, people like knowing where they start. stand and what's going on, you know, and I use that bar analogy of like when I was a bartender in college and it was like five people deep and they didn't know who I was going to serve next. They're all going crazy and just screaming and then finally I got so frustrated. like thought, you know, I was just like, all right, I'm starting here. I'm working my way that way. If you get out of line, it's your own fault. And they all just went silent because they knew when they were going to get served next, you know, they were like managing each other. Like if somebody got in when they like it wasn't their turn, they're like, Hey, and so it was amazing because and they were thanking me, you know, because it's like, I took the anxiety away by telling them what the process was, and they knew when they were going to get served.

AcquiMatch Team: So they would wait there sometimes 45 minutes, but they were thanking me and tipping me very well because they knew when it was happening as opposed to me, erratically being like, you, you, you know, so like, yeah, that's I hate that when you go to the bar and they're just like, there's no order. And it's like, you guys are going to make me have to fight. someone to get a beer here. Just tell me you acknowledge I'm here so I don't have to elbow somebody.

Athena Simpson: But even I don't even need to acknowledge you if I have a process, right? Like you know I'm starting here I'm working my way here and then I'm coming back here and doing it again, right? So it's like and then they all communicate with each other and tell them and then the regulars know what's happening. So it's just like it calms people down when they know what's happening. So like since I learned that I just like over-communicate sometimes people's expectations so that I'm oh I'm under promising and then we over-deliver. So then they're delighted when they like get things like that they want to move on in the first one. It's like wow that's so cool you know when they were thinking that it's going to be a couple months before they found things that they liked. it just helps us all while we're calibrating and figure things out as a team and now we've got David coming in who's going to hopefully get it to the point where we're not running around, you know like seeing client.

Luke Gillespie: But you might get a LOI with 70% seller financing, something like that. So the question I'm just asking is, for the write up in the calculation section, how should I model out these hypothetical numbers for a deal that's not going to be using SBA? Because I just have that quick deal calculator with the SBA. Do I still just do that and tell them, look, you won't be using SBA, but this could still give you a rough estimate of what it could look like if you got a seller note 10 years, 10%? What were your thoughts?

Athena Simpson: I'm staying quiet for Ryan to answer first before I do.

AcquiMatch Team: Good question. haven't thought about this.

Luke Gillespie: I mean, I'd be more than happy to start getting into the more complex financial model and be able to get some better screenshot. I said that into the write-up for our clients.

AcquiMatch Team: I mean, yeah, the most important thing really here is if I'm thinking about if I was going to do it, right? Like, what am I looking at? Like, the multiple still important to me, right? what's the multiple? The margins still important to me. I'm trying to think, what on this thing changes? I mean, the only thing that changes is the debt service and the mount left after loan payments really. So, I mean, you could almost just leave it as is and just reference there that, you know, if you're... this one hasn't isn't going to work for SBA that you can pretty just notate that. But I mean, all of the businesses that I listed in the past when I worked on, we didn't think about SBA. I mean, all of our deals were mainly cash buys with some seller financing. So we just put the multiple, the revenue, the margins, the pricing period, like how many, like what months were utilized to calculate the valuation. We put year over year growth. And that's, that's pretty much it. So I don't really, I can't really think of anything of like how you could change something there. Athena, do you have anything to add?

Athena Simpson: Um, question first, how, how did the seller find out? And saying conversation and come up, how is it framed?

Luke Gillespie: The broker. No, no, go ahead, look, we're asking me or I'm sorry.

Luke Gillespie: Yeah, he brought it up first and then so I've probed in. was like, Oh, okay. So we mentioned seller financing. How much would he be willing to do? Cause that that always comes up with an honest be ideal, right? Cause it's going to be some amount of cash, some amount of seller financing. So the broker is kind of like, you know, who knows who's going to show up, how much cash they're going to give and how much seller financing they're going to want. So then I asked him about the seller financing and he said, I think 15% will be good. Maybe go up to 20%. But he was kind of keeping his cards to his chest. You know, it wasn't a very strong absolute like don't even dare ask for over 20%. And again, because there's no competition here right now, they haven't don't have any offers yet. So that was how it went.

Athena Simpson: And why doesn't it qualify for us? here.

Luke Gillespie: I don't know. I actually didn't ask. I just took him out as word for it. He had that was like the first thing you mentioned on our first call from the day before from yesterday. He was like, just, you know, it's not called by the recipe. I was like, yeah, that's fine.

Athena Simpson: I knew that. was okay. That is the crucial information that we need. Why do you think we need to know that?

Luke Gillespie: Because it would clearly show some holes in the business. I know I thought about asking it in the call and then I just didn't.

Athena Simpson: Um, how responsive was he? How easy would that be to get that information before you send this off?

Luke Gillespie: I could get it. Yeah, he's responsive. He's a good broker.

Athena Simpson: Yeah, cool. So if our client, if it doesn't qualify for SBA financing, it means there's a problem with it, in which case we, you know, our job is not to negotiate the structuring or anything at this point. It's to advise the client on on the deal as far as we know. potential risk, potential problems that they might anticipate, right? So, it's not our job to help Andrew raise money. We can help him with the structuring he said he's willing to like figure out how to pay for it on his own or whatever. That's a little bit further down the line. So first we need to understand like, what are we dealing with here? Why it doesn't qualify for SBA? You know, if it's like, oh, it's been around less than three years and it's like, okay, but that should be like, the first thing in the write up is like, hey, this doesn't qualify for SBA because and then or it's like the the the the tax returns are bad or they're like, it was all cash, you know, it's like, so we need to know what it is that we can decide is this something that our client can overcome or is it something pretty bad that we actually shouldn't put in front of them. Like, in all cash business, it's like, if it's all cash, that we needed to discuss amongst ourselves. is there ways for the client to be able to verify if they're going to put their livelihood on the line or all of their life savings into it or whatever? So we want to uncover the warts as much as possible before, like it's for something like that before we hand it over or decide if it's something we do want to hand over knowing the warts. Like, is it a deal adjustment? Is it a deal killer? And this kind of what they're hiring us for is to kind of in our opinion to be able to make that decision. So this isn't addressing down by any means. I think you're doing great. When you hear that it doesn't qualify for SBA, then you can be friendly about it. Oh, really? why not? Or, you know, is that your opinion? did you actually have someone look at it? Do you know what's going on there? Maintain that relationship. It's crucial information for us to figure out. then you can dive a little bit deeper into the why. It might just be it's too young, you know, in which case that's a risk. that our client is taking on, then it doesn't have that kind of history. And they can make a decision on whether they want to do that or not. Yeah. The other thing on the seller finance is because of the codeies out there, brokers can get very weird about seller finance. So it's something you don't want to push at all. It is not the time for the conversation. If they offer it up, great. But just be wary of that. don't know if I've told you enough about that, but there's, you know, because of the Cody Sanchez's and all these masterminds and whatever telling people they can do these deals at 100% seller finance, if the broker gets wind, that somebody's not financially qualified to do a deal or is going to try to push the seller to do very high financing, then they can kind of end up freezing up. So, yeah, so just be wary on that one. Just if they offer it up, be like, hey, what do you think? In your opinion, the seller would be comfortable with there. Or what do you think the seller is going to need to do to get this deal done? So you can put it to the broker and be like, in your opinion, what do you think the seller is going to need to do here to be able to get a deal done on the seller finance side? So it might be different than what the seller wants. And then you know whether you have a broker who's going to help push her. actually, know, right now he's saying none, but I think he's probably going to have to do 15 to 20% to be able to get this done.

Luke Gillespie: Yeah. Yeah. And those say that sometimes. Yeah.

Athena Simpson: So if you want to dance around it, rather than being like, how much seller financing are they willing to do? Be like, Hey, in your opinion, what do you think the seller, you know, how do you think this is going to have to be structured for it to happen? Like, do you think any seller financing the owner is going to need to give?

Luke Gillespie: what's your opinion, right?

Athena Simpson: then you're playing to their, like, you're closer to this. Like, what's the seller willing to do? And what do you think it's going to take to get the deal done?

Luke Gillespie: Yeah, good point. Yeah, and I never push on the stuff. So I always ask it. say, is the seller open to any amount of seller financing? Then they'll say something and be like, Oh, you know, we got an offer 70% seller financing and I'll be like, Oh, yeah, my buyer went doing anything like that. So yeah, I always ask it like that. And yeah, then you were right from last week, you should trust your gut. Like, in my gut, I knew I should ask why I didn't qualify for SBA. But I was just like, it already didn't put it already didn't qualify. I'm just not going ask about it. But and I'm realizing the LLC is headquartered in Miami. I thought it was made because this guy was foreign, at least just in the seller interview, had an accent. But it's the LLC's headquartered in Miami and it was founded in 2014. So maybe that's even more of a red flag that's something's going on there. Why weren't qualified? So yeah, I'll do some more diligence tomorrow.

Athena Simpson: Yeah, cool. Always. Always. If it doesn't qualify, find out why. And it's like it there's a difference between it hasn't been qualified yet versus it's been looked at, and it does not qualify. Yeah, I know, yeah, and if it has been looked at and it does not qualify, then we need to, we need to understand that. So then we can decide like, is this something that our client can ever come? And we think they should push on it, despite this, or is this a no-go and we shouldn't put it in front of them? Um, so yeah, trust your gut on that. And then with the seller finance question, just see how they respond to that, but I might try different ways of, rather than are they open to seller financing, you can be like, um, you know, how, how is the seller feeling about seller financing or they wanting all cash at close? Like, uh, you know, what's your opinion in terms of what the seller's going to need to do to get this done other ways rather than just like, are they open to it? if we've qualified earlier on and said like, you know, our buyers pre-qualified for 9 million. It's like, oh, okay, cool. You know, so I don't have the context of where you're saying it, what the conversation was to that point. But I just do know it's a massive hot button right now brokers because of these internet influencers out there talking about it. So just be careful about that can be the way in mind that you don't realize as you're learning how to build the relationships and build up trust with these guys, it might not even be worth bringing up to be honest on the calls if you're feeling like you don't have a really good relationship with them by the time you're bringing it up.

Luke Gillespie: Okay, good point.

Athena Simpson: You can save the relationship if you don't, know, if you're like, I mean, we're getting Justin's qualified for nine, you know, like they're getting pretty high good call numbers, right? So if you like, weed with that on the client that you're reaching out on on behalf of them. And if you feel the brokers not really like warming up to you and you haven't gotten a good relationship, then honestly, and I don't know. Ryan feels about this. I wouldn't even bring up seller financing what the clients bring it up later when they've established relationship and their credibility. What do you think, Ryan?

AcquiMatch Team: Yeah, I mean, I think the broker's main, their main thing is if, I mean, been doing this low crisis, you know, but like usually they'll just say the standard, they're open to 10%, right? They'll say nothing more than that. And then you might even ask the seller on the next call, are you open to seller financing? go, sure, or they'll go, what's that? They don't even know. This is the broker's just, it's how really relevant is that question because the broker is just going to say 10% regardless.

Luke Gillespie: Yeah, yeah, good point.

Athena Simpson: They often get their fees on cash to close, not the finance portion. So, or they're worried about not getting all of their fees if there's a substantial seller finance.

Luke Gillespie: So also the broker's motivation. patients are a little bit different than what the sellers might be. Yeah, good point.

Athena Simpson: Cool, nice work. Sorry, I kept y'all so late. Anything else feeling good?

AcquiMatch Team: Oh, good.

Athena Simpson: Cool. Let's have another look. Just since we have a week and a half left, it's a short month and just see if there's anything, any, any others that we need to give some love or maybe a push to and or conversation to manage expectations. I feel like it's a little late to be like, Hey, JB, do you not want any deals this month? So I'd rather get him another deal this month and have that conversation with him so that we can decide if we want to pull off the gas a little bit in March. And he agreed to it.

Luke Gillespie: You know what I'm saying? Yeah. No, that's doable. Basically, where we're at right now, just get the two minimums for Jason and Gil and get an extra one for JB.

Athena Simpson: That's very realistic, doable. Cool. Great. Awesome. And then let's try to find a direct hit for DL, get them off to a good start. And then we've got Justin starting beginning. March and he's talking with potential clients. He's in all these like search groups and that sort of things.

Luke Gillespie: We're going to have to really get him off to a good start to awesome.

Athena Simpson: Nice work guys. Well, hopefully we'll have Renan on Thursday. That'll be fun. All initiate that with Dave ASAP. He just wanted me to put in writing kind of what I was thinking in terms of our fees. So once I do that, then he'll give access to it's a redacted thing. And I was like, let me get my team in there. They'll identify, they'll give me an idea of what kind of volume that they'd want to proceed with having conversations and then we can go from there and figure out, like, do we just do a have his team do a temperature check, have us do a temperature check. He'd suggested we do a little test where they do 10 and we do 10, whatever. So it looks like there's hundreds in there potentially.

Luke Gillespie: Cool.

Athena Simpson: Awesome. Nice, cool. Sorry to catch you late. Thank you for staying late. Thank you for all that you do. um excited excited excited let's get some of these clients closed yeah don't give up on Tariq i'm optimistic on Tariq i love it i love it Luke uh you're you're actually getting a little shout out in the newsletter this week so oh thank you looking for your mindset yeah cool thanks um awesome cool all right uh i will see you all Thursday i think yep i guess
