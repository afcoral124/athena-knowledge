  It's going alright, a little bit wonky, navigating it the first time, and unfortunately this first one is a bit of an atypical case. They're not really wanting to do an asking price. They want to do a bid out, so coming to what would be the normal things we do is a little bit atypical. But, yeah, just trying to work through the process.

0:32 - Luke Gillespie
  What's the brokerage?

0:35 - Anke Jordaan
  Viking.

0:37 - Luke Gillespie
  Viking. Oh, that's the one we've been talking about, the SP, Industrial Distributor. Yeah, super weird, man.

0:46 - Ryan Cash
  Like, one, there's also, looks like there's a huge, like, $6 million piece of real estate that's not included. Or, well, it is included, but it's not included in the financial. So I'm thinking it's probably going to be too big because it's doing like 2.3 million in SDE, even if it's at like a 3x multiple, it puts it within their range. But if the buyer also wants this like $5 million property to be part of the loan, like, I don't know, it's probably going to be pretty edge case. And like the add-backs are the most insane add-backs I've ever seen. Like they've got $350,000 of car wash expenses that are included in the add-backs as part of this SDE calculation. It's $200,000 in entertainment. He's like a sponsor of like the Atlanta Braves. There's $200,000 across like various like entertainment portions and then like another 20,000 and like plane flights. Like, his salary he's paying himself, assumingly, is like $400,000. So, like, a lot of weird add-backs that I've not seen, and I wouldn't even really, you know, being like a first deal, I'm looking at, like, I wouldn't call that SDE 2.3 million, you know? And it's also, like, a lot of red flags over, like, the broker is trying to, like, add all these entertainment, like, numbers back into the SDE, and it's like, well, you know, sure, I'm sure a lot of this is excessive, but I'm sure a lot of these fees are also actually are generating income. So it's like, you can't add the entire entertainment bill back into the, like, calculation. It's not, it's not real life, dude. Yeah, interesting.

2:57 - Luke Gillespie
  Definitely things to, like, flag on your review and put it. And if you're prepping the call for me to do the call, you would write those questions down, like, ask about this add-back, $300k for entertainment. Like, yeah, ask questions about that. $350,000 car wash expense on the year. Like, who has $350,000 car wash expenses that are adding back into the SDE calculation?

3:21 - Athena Simpson
  Oh, I know. Money laundering? Yeah, right?

3:26 - Ryan Cash
  Like, it totally feels that way. It's like, and then another, like, you know, just dropping like $50,000 on it. Man, a Braves game here, like, strange. What is going on here? There's a line item that just says Lily and has like a price next to it. And I'm like, I don't know who Lily is, but based on the way this SDE is, like, I might not want to know what's going on on this.

3:56 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah. Interesting. I don't know. It's kind of like, I guess.

4:00 - Ryan Cash
  I was like, at what point, like, do you want to push a deal, like, forward? And, like, how aggressive are we with wanting to, like, push deals into conversations? Kind of like, what's the line that we look for that is something that we don't want to chase down? I guess it's something that I'm still really in the gray area on. How would you answer that, Luke?

4:29 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah, we want to push as many SIMs to calls as possible. So for this one, even though those are weird add-backs, like, we'd still push it to do a call. It sounds like a great deal. When I talked to the broker the first time, it sounded like a great deal. I hear you that it's a little big, $6 million of real estate. Steve and Polly have told us that they're actually interested and excited in bigger deals going up to $10 million asking price. So they're open to that. And yeah, I get they're listing it as 2.3 mil SDE, but then they have all these crazy add-backs realistically have to do. Due diligence, QoE, I might come back at like 1.5 million, but we would still push it and we would ask the broker about all those questionable add-backs and then we would flag all those add-backs to Steve and Polly in the write-up. So we're still like noting everything and flagging it to them, but we would still push it because it sounds like it could still be a good deal.

5:21 - Athena Simpson
  So just to clarify real quick, Cash, with Luke, why would we push as many SIMs as possible and why would we push it?

5:29 - Luke Gillespie
  Give some context as to the reason why we would do that. Yeah, so one reason is just to increase deal flow. want to keep as open of mind as possible because sometimes you'll look at a SIM and think it's a bad deal, but then once it goes in front of the client, the client's super excited and ends up submitting an LOI actually. So we just want to increase deal flow as much as possible within certain parameters. But the main one that Athena is getting at is that we don't want a whole bunch of SIMs being received and then the analysts throwing them out because then the team members on The front end of the pipeline are technically wasting a whole bunch of work.

6:02 - Athena Simpson
  They put a lot of work in to get all those SIMs, and then the analyst just throws them out. So it's inefficient. Well, let me restate that because maybe the intention has been lost. So if there is genuine red flags in a deal, we don't want to put bad deals in front of clients, right? Like 90% customer concentration, things that can't be funded by SBA, like things that are just like a non-starter, which you'll learn as you go through this process what those are. Early on, when you're learning, I would say err on the side of let me push it, have a conversation, see what I can learn with it, bring it to us, we'll all review it, and then can go from there. The pushing as many SIMs as possible in the way that Luke described it, Luke, maybe teaching moment for all of us, I wouldn't agree with that, right? What we need to get better at is if we're throwing out a bunch of SIMs for genuine reasons, then identifying why we're doing that and seeing if there's a way to communicate it back to the early end team on why you're throwing those out so that they're not continuing to push things that you're just going to throw out by the time it gets to you. But honestly, a lot of the times cash when we get a SIM is when we get enough information. The listing is usually pretty light, but err on the side of using it as a learning opportunity for yourself to like dig into why are they putting those in there and would I agree with that. If there's a way to justify add-backs that the owner was taking his family members and it's not related to like business at all, maybe, right? But then we can flag it with the client. So you're picking up on the right. And then it gives you an opportunity to start practicing on broker calls, you know, digging into that, asking, why are they putting that? Do I think that it's warranted? So err on the side of, you know, what we do with clients is that we say verify assumptions, you know, always go to broker call and owner call and we can do the same thing early on, especially while you're early in the process and learning. And the more calls you're having, the better your, like, view of reviewing the SIMs and should I put this forward, we'll get to that kind of like discernment.

8:41 - Ryan Cash
  Got you. No, totally, totally get that. Have we ever sent a client to like a bidding process on a deal? Like sent them to an auction on a deal? Like something like this? What do you mean an auction?

8:59 - Athena Simpson
  Is that, is that common? For Viking, is that how they're listing their deals?

9:02 - Luke Gillespie
  Is like not disclosing prices?

9:04 - Ryan Cash
  Oh, a lot of brokers do that.

9:07 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah.

9:08 - Athena Simpson
  Okay.

9:08 - Ryan Cash
  Got you.

9:10 - Athena Simpson
  But I mean, I'll still, oh, sorry. I'll say something real quick, Charis, and then would love to hear your thoughts. A lot of brokers will not put a listing price on there. Benchmark is like big on that too. Um, I, you know, and they kind of want to see what the market will do. There's a lot of reasons why they might do that. Like the broker can't get the client to get to an idea of what reality looks like for their valuation. So they'll let the market show them by like what the offers are that come in. Also, when you get on the broker calls, that's where I'm like, hey, I know there's no listing price, but in your professional opinion, what do you think?

9:51 - Luke Gillespie
  And when you start getting into broker call training, we'll, we'll talk about some of these techniques, but like getting their opinion, seeing if they'll give you an idea or range or whatever. And

10:00 - Athena Simpson
  In some way, but that's not abnormal for there not to be a listing price on there. Charis, what were your thoughts on that?

10:08 - Charis Siau
  Yeah, just the auction process. Yeah, a lot of brokers will try to do auction process, especially on bigger deals. And essentially, it's just a constraint of timing with receiving IOIs or LOIs. And they just try to get as many LOIs that they can get within a certain deadline so that they can work competitively against each offer that comes in. So it's not a crazy process. It's just a time constraint. And then our client needs to be just quick. If they really like the deal, they just need to be especially quick on timing with reviewing and submitting an offer. more?

11:01 - Ryan Cash
  Yeah, no, that makes a lot more sense. I'm guessing that would probably be something to figure out on the broker call, like what timelines they're looking at for.

11:09 - Athena Simpson
  Absolutely.

11:12 - Ryan Cash
  Every broker has their own process, right?

11:14 - Athena Simpson
  So like one of the things that you guys will be doing is figuring out what their process is, the time sensitivity is, so that we can advise the clients accordingly. Like in my property management deal, it was an auction situation because it was a massive one, right? And so they were having the owner still meet everyone, but then they were collecting all the offers within a certain deadline. And then, you know, it was kind of cool what they did. They were like scoring on a whole bunch of different areas with the LOIs. was like price, likelihood to close. Do we like the buyer and think the buyer is a good owner of the business? And then they were just getting, you know, whiteboard out and spend a whole day with all the offers talking through pluses, minuses, here's what all this means, et cetera. So they might, you know, it sucks for our clients, but oftentimes it's not just like highest price is the winner because all the terms are going to come into place. Private equity is usually going to lock in a seller for a couple years as CEO, you know, and they don't want to do that half the time. So sometimes we can, you know, it's, it's all in kind of understanding what their process is, what the other offers might be looking like. And like my broker was telling me, he's like, I shouldn't tell you this, but around this number is kind of where we needed to come in. And then somebody offered 2 million more enterprise value because they, they gave the same price that I gave with a 20% rollover to the owners, which means like them retaining 20% equity. So essentially my $8 million offer with a hundred percent equity to me, they got an $8 million offer from this new buyer plus 20% ownership. So it was like 10 million enterprise value.

13:00 - Charis Siau
  Did they get it? Oh, yeah.

13:03 - Athena Simpson
  I lost the deal. I  hated it. I would have been able to structure something similar. I would have been able to offer $10 million had I not been relying on the broker's lender to help me structure it.

13:16 - Charis Siau
  Oh, damn. Yeah, because he had me putting up $1.5 million in a certificate of deposit as collateral against the deal instead of putting it to work in the deal. Hmm. Ouch. Yeah, totally  me over.

13:34 - Athena Simpson
  But it's why I'm so insane about the structuring process and also helping our clients have someone to actually talk through that stuff with. It's not a lender looking out for mitigating their own risk and on the broker's side also. In my case, the broker was wanting me to get a green light from the lender so that they could keep pushing me forward because he really liked me. ...but... But the lender was looking out for, they didn't typically do pari passu above the SBA guarantee. They weren't a cash flow lender straight up. You know, it a subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway or like a carve out from them that did SBA lending. So like had I gone with one of the lenders we know now, I probably would have been in a different situation. So, so pissed, but I started this business and we're all here now because of that, you know, that's right.

14:33 - Charis Siau
  So cool.

14:34 - Athena Simpson
  I know you guys had a chat, but like the, you know, the purpose of these, these calls with all of us is while you're learning and getting up to speed with write-ups and that sort of thing, we're going to do deal reviews. So you guys are going to be sending through your write-ups before we'll talk through it. And Luke got, you know, quite a bit of time with me on this. So it's like, I can kind of impart. word. Yeah. Deal wisdom, but also since we all have different backgrounds and skill sets, like you guys are going to be able to chime in on each other's deals too. So I'm really excited about that. Especially like if Luke or Cash come up on a franchise deal, Charis has a ton of experience there. Or if there's a certain industry that you guys have looked at before or a brokerage that you've worked with. So I see this as kind of our way, like ongoing, we'll keep this in place so we can collaborate. Initially, it's going to be like, okay, let's help you guys get up to speed with how we analyze deals and, you know, matching up to clients and that sort of thing. And Luke will have you continue to bring your deals back to this and also participate from it. So you can get not only my view, but these guys' views on different deals, maybe that we're stuck on or that we're thinking of putting through or whatever. So that's, it's my view for how we're going to do this ongoing. And for today, I just wanted to kind of talk through a couple things. Um, and then we had some stuff on the agenda too, but, um, for, sorry, um, my brain just went in like three, whenever I pause, it's because my brain goes in like three different directions and I'm trying to figure out which path I want to go down first. Um, on, so I know you've just started it today, but one of the things that's on our minds is making sure that all the clients start getting write-ups next week, right? Um, new clients and existing clients. So we know Luke's been doing some training with you on that, but I, Anke and I were just talking and we think, um, that it would be a good goal to set that by the end of next week, Cash and Charis are able to kind of take their own broker calls and start doing write-ups. I'll want to sign those write-ups off until I feel like you're, you're in a good place to just kind of do them without. But that's really the goal that I'd like to get to. Does that feel, it might be, I imagine it'll be challenging, but does it feel realistic to get to that point?

17:16 - Charis Siau
  Yeah, I think based on the track that we're on right now, think end of next week, write-ups, broker calls, I think it's pretty much where we're, you know, leading up to. And I think that's a good timeline.

17:34 - Athena Simpson
  Cool.

17:38 - Ryan Cash
  Yeah, I'd follow that as well and say that that sounds pretty fair. I know for myself, probably the biggest bottleneck is just more process-oriented stuff. Just, yeah, just process of where things are submitted, how to move stuff around, formats, stuff like that is probably where I spend, like. Most of my time getting, getting up on at the moment. Yeah.

18:04 - Athena Simpson
  And, you know, like I said, it's a new process to have three of you too. So we're, we're building rocket ship while we're launching it. But, um, I, I, like I said, I don't think there's any like huge risks, even if you get on a broker call and like, don't know all the answers or questions to ask. It's okay. Like it's learning and it's not completely like dire, you know? Um, and then with the write-ups, we'll, we'll be reviewing them before you get them out to clients. So it's not like there's a huge risk in, in having you guys starting to do these activities, at least from where I'm sitting. So, but I want to make sure we're not like pushing you out of the plane without a parachute. So you'll be getting, what's that? Is it off to our death?

18:51 - Charis Siau
  Yeah, no, I don't, I don't think that's the case.

18:53 - Athena Simpson
  I think you guys are more than capable.

18:56 - Charis Siau
  Otherwise I wouldn't be suggesting it, but then that gives us all kind.

19:00 - Athena Simpson
  Kind of a goal to work to by the end of next week so that the clients are starting to see deal flow really is what I want to get us unstuck on that.

19:11 - Ryan Cash
  Yeah, I think, again, I think that's totally reasonable for me. think within a week, like I said, the biggest bottleneck is just like process. Like if we were to turn the switch on right now, I would just probably trip and get stuck on like, you know, kind of minute like details of how to open stuff up and move stuff around. So I think by like in the next week, like that should be a lot more second nature. I'm not really too worried about like hopping on a broker call and like asking questions. I just don't want like the process to be like a bottleneck that turns into like an anxious ordeal over on getting stuff done on time. So, yeah, I think by next week, like, having more time to get up to speed on just how things are done would be pretty reasonable.

20:09 - Athena Simpson
  Cool. So, yeah, I mean, you're going to have daily check-ins now on the DLT meeting. So any of those, like, process issues, stuff that you come up with, like, that's a good time to flag it and or in the channel. Anke is going to be doing daily check-ins with you, Cash and Charis, too, next week to just make sure you have anything you need. If questions come up during training, what we're trying to get to next week is giving you some more time to do and, you know, spend some time with the handbooks and that sort of thing. So she'll be sharing exactly what that looks like next week. But you're going to do some, like, contextual broker call training with me and then some process how-to with Luke after that. So, you know, just like we did last week with, like, I'll do the why and then Luke will give you the how-to. to do? And I'm on the broker call front. But yeah, I'm excited. I think it's been fun to start bringing you guys onto the calls with clients. And I know we're kind of deep in modeling on some of them. So it probably feels like, what the hell is going on with that? But the more you get exposure to the modeling, like it'll start to click, you know, we're kind of saying the same things over and over again on that sort of stuff. So I think you won't necessarily need to do that with them. We can like get them on to Buyer's Club if they have like deep modeling questions or structural questions to like have time with me. But I would like to get to the point where after next week that you guys have enough deal flow that you can be doing those client calls, the weekly check-ins on your own and just like talking through the deals, getting ready for broker calls, like that sort of thing. So that's my aim. We'll see where we get to and make sure that you guys feel. So again, don't want to like push you out of the plane without a parachute, but I think you're pretty, I don't know if hungry is the right word, but I think you guys are like excited to like start sinking your teeth out of things.

22:14 - Ryan Cash
  Yeah, definitely. Always good to be adding value and, you know, doing some of the work that's going to move the company forward. So definitely excited up on calls myself.

22:27 - Athena Simpson
  Sweet. So something that I'm going to add for all of you, Luke included on, or that I've, I've told Anka that I want you guys to do, but I'll tell you, so have time to prep for it on those daily standups that you're going to be doing in the morning, just a one sentence update on each one of your clients. So that there's a daily check-in on somebody who doesn't have an active deal that they're working on. It's like, okay, what are we doing about that? You guys are going to own that and be like, so-and-so still hasn't had a deal. How's it looking? Here's what I'm doing on it, et cetera. But, um, You know, in addition to the numbers, which gives us an overall view of what the bottlenecks are. But since we're splitting out clients individually, one second update for Anke on like, okay, so-and-so got a new deal yesterday. They're working on this or so-and-so rejected the deal yesterday. They don't have a deal right now. This is what I'm doing, or this is what I have in the pipeline that I think I'll get out to them. Does that sound good? Yeah, that sounds good.

23:28 - Ryan Cash
  I think in terms of like, reporting, I was added to a reporting channel in Slack. Would anyone want to explain like, what the process is for that?

23:46 - Anke Jordaan
  Uh, yeah, I, um, goodness, I'm trying to think. I thought I did, uh, talk about this cash, but let me just, if I did it, apologize. Yeah, my bad. I started adding you guys to the necessary channels. You need, you know, to be on. And then, so we have a channel that has a Thursday report. So it's, I think I talked about this in the team handbook. So essentially, it's just like Thursday report. You talk about what your wins was for the week, where your challenges was for the week. It fills in a couple of things to get your mind flowing. And then that helps, that helps with some of the discussions we can talk through on the one-to-one meeting on Friday.

24:30 - Ryan Cash
  Got you. Sounds good.

24:34 - Athena Simpson
  Okay, cool. What else was on, what else did I mention to you, Anke, that I wanted to chat through today?

24:40 - Anke Jordaan
  The stuff that you mentioned to me, you already covered everything. And then it's just a couple of stuff that was already in the agenda.

24:53 - Athena Simpson
  Do you want me to pull that up? Sorry, I was just reading. I got distracted. I shouldn't have done that. I'll— Say that to me one more time.

25:04 - Anke Jordaan
  Everything we talked about in our meeting, you already mentioned in this meeting. It's just the stuff that was already on the agenda.

25:09 - Athena Simpson
  Do you want me to pull that up? Yeah, let's do it. Okay, perfect.
  SCREEN SHARING: Anke started screen sharing - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/373289201?timestamp=1517.624437

25:18 - Anke Jordaan
  So I think you asked Luke to bring to the agenda today the base multiple evaluation tool. And then you have two items that you want to talk about, the tag to initiate clients and the quick calculator from client deal files.

25:38 - Athena Simpson
  Yeah. Luke, did you train these guys on it when you were doing write-ups, the evaluation tool, or have they not seen it?

25:46 - Luke Gillespie
  tool, no, that's new. Okay, cool. haven't seen that, no.

25:52 - Athena Simpson
  Let's pull it up. Anke, do you have, are you able to pull it up?

25:59 - Anke Jordaan
  Okay.
  SCREEN SHARING: Athena started screen sharing - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/373289201?timestamp=1594.383042

27:01 - Athena Simpson
  Luke, let's keep this one clean. Or was this just a sample that I had in there?

27:07 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah, this is how it was provided to me from the start. Got it. Okay.

27:13 - Athena Simpson
  So when I went to the first acquisition.com workshop, it was like this two-day workshop. And the very first day was all about teaching people how to value their own businesses, which I was like, and, you know, Alex Hormozi just has a scene where he tries to explain things that a 10th grader would understand. And I was like, this is actually a really awesome tool that I would love for us to start experimenting with. And essentially what it allows us to do is come up with, you know, what a multiple might look like for a business based on some different factors. And we've been adding some other things in here because essentially what comes up a lot of the times is the clients are... We're like, how would you value the business? And most of the time with an on-market deal where there's maybe more than one interested buyer, you're going to land between a three and a four multiple I've seen because of, you know, that's where the top end of SBA financing no longer working because of debt service coverage ratio. So then it's like, okay, well, how do we make a simple tool for them to assess what it might be worth to them, but also for us to get a gauge on where the risk factors lie, where the value adders lie? How do we create some level of standardization between us, the team, on how we're reviewing the deals? So Luke and I have been experimenting with this scorecard that we can use to start looking at what are the things that might be a value adder in this business? What are the value subtractors? And then what are... You know, some adjustments that might make it more valuable or things going on that we need to be thinking about. So we've been adding and subtracting to this. And one of the conversations we're going to have today is if we should bump the base, which we're both in agreement that we think we should. And the way this works is you're going to make a copy of this for every deal, put in the business name, whatever the idea is, who the client is and what the link to the write-up is. What the revenue is, what their SDE is. And then this will, based on what the SDE is, you'll pull the baseline multiple from this column over here. We're going to increase all of these on the template. And then as you're going through, it's like, okay, what are the things that make it good? Has it had a, what does the C stand for? Or again, Luke, I put this in there and I can't even. Remember the compound annual growth rate?

30:02 - Luke Gillespie
  Thank you.

30:03 - Athena Simpson
  So did it grow by more than 10% in the previous year? You put the answers in the A column and then put 0.15 value adder if it's a yes. So is the SDE margin more than 20%? Did they grow more than 20%? Do they have contracted or recurring revenue north of 30% of their revenue? Is the owner out of the day-to-day? Is there an operator in place? Is it a remote business or relocatable? Do they have strong SOPs, i.e. documents on how the whole business runs and it's not in the owner's head? So if any of these exist, you add that into the column here. And then from subtractors, it's like, okay, is there key man risk? Does the owner do a ton of stuff in the business? Is there a client concentration more than And 30% of the revenue is coming from one client. Any revenue volatility, i.e. were they not stable or growing in the last three years? Do they have one place that they get clients or do they have one person that they get all of their products from? Do they have CapEx expenditures that they have to make like a car wash has to do a $250,000 investment every five years? Have they been running the business on cash? Do they have really poor books? Do they not have the books? Is it a seasonal business? Is it project-based? Are there multiple owners that are going to be exiting the business? Are there family members involved in the business? Are there questionable add-backs? These are all things that are, you know, potential big risks. Like we just had Jenny who was under offer on a deal. The 85-year-old owner pulled out because he. He didn't want to, he was worried about his grandson not continuing in the business after him. So like she already spent money on deal team, that sort of thing. It's like, if there's family members in the business, it's a big risk, right? So we can start using this to start identifying what are the risks in the business. And also it's a checklist for you before you put a deal in front of the client. Have I asked all the, do I know the answers to all of these questions? Right. Then there's adjustments like has the, has, have they said that they're willing to do a seller note more than 10% of the purchase price? That's pretty awesome. That's a, you know, how much is it? Has it been pre-qualified by the SBA? Awesome. Then we know it's potentially financeable. Is there a performance note option? So this revenue volatility, even though it's a detractor can be an upside. I, I, I, I, Because we're able to put a forgivable performance-based note in if they had a high year over a low year. And then also what's the market trend? So the market or the industry it's in, like if it's in a high growth industry, then we'd add to that. Luke, you had a question on this one. Let's see. Luke, it's just add that amount to it.

33:32 - Luke Gillespie
  Okay, I get it.

33:34 - Athena Simpson
  So we can remove the X's.

33:36 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah, okay.

33:40 - Athena Simpson
  Cool. So like something like printing, right? Like it's a dying industry. So like the industry that the business is in, what is it doing? Is it flat? Oh, that's why I put it in there. Because it was doing that. Okay, hang on. It was just a formatting thing, Luke. To keep it on the left side. But yeah, just adding that amount in over here. So let's say, for example, it's a moderately growing business, then it would be a zero adjustment. If it's a very declining business or industry, then we'd put negative 0.3 here. And essentially what that ends up doing is then giving us a multiple and then an idea of what the valuation is on purchase price. It's interesting, we did this for Steve and Pauly, and the asking price was exactly where our multiple ended up landing. Luke, when we were doing the Hive one recently, like their asking multiple is 3.55x, and that's what our valuation tool came up with. So does that make sense so far?

34:52 - Ryan Cash
  Yeah, mean, concept-wise, definitely would have to get in and do an example. your attention? if know think Tell you if it actually made sense at the end of the day. But yeah, no, get it. And fortunately, I did watch you do that one with Steve and Polly two days ago on here. So I I've got a little bit of an idea on my end.

35:16 - Athena Simpson
  Yeah. Charis, how about you? What do you think about this?

35:23 - Charis Siau
  Yeah, I think it's a good tool to have. Um, I've seen, you know, valuations done in many different ways. So I think, I don't know, I don't know how this will pan out for industries that are outside the norm, you know, the normal outlier of the three to four. So there are some industries that are crazy multiples, you know, some in software, tech, some in healthcare. So I wonder... So wonder... You know, will this, for those type of businesses, will this current formula be correct for the adjustment in the industry? But I think for most industries, right, this will work. Um, yeah, and we'll need to refine it.

36:19 - Athena Simpson
  That's why I want, like, before we start introing to this, to the clients, like, I want, I want you guys using it alongside your write-ups. think it does two things. One is, it holds us accountable to make sure that we've asked, at least asked all of these questions before we put a write-up in front of a client. Um, so that we're identifying, like, pretty much the main areas. It could be a gotcha or a, you know, actually, we shouldn't put this in front of them because it's 90% customer concentration. Like, it's just a non-starter, right? Um, and then two is, as we use this, we can see, like, you know, we need to make a job. adjustments on it, but like we're realizing the baseline's too low because there's so many value detractors often that it's like pulling the multiple too low. So us experimenting with this, what I would like to get to is some sort of tool that gives clients a guide, right? It's like, this is not definitive. This is not how the market does valuations. That's kind of thrown out the window anyway with like so many buyers. And it's just like, can it be financed by SBA? It's like, what's the biggest price that you get financed for SBA, which usually ends up between a three and a four. But at least like if we get it to a point where like roundabout, we're kind of happy with where this lands, then it's a tool for clients to use and just be like, okay, you can add things into this that are like important to you. You know, I need it within 15 minutes of my house. I want to be able to go get my workouts in the morning. So that's kind of my view is like, how can we give them the tool? It's like, it's not how the market does it, but it's how you need to evaluate what's important to you. So this is the baseline. And then you can add value adders or subtractors that are personal to you as you go through it is kind of the vision that I have for it after we've refined it to a point where we're like, we're using this, you know, to, to make sure that, you know, what are all the things? And if it's like super heavy in the value detractors and it's like, well, is there too many things in this business that maybe also make it like more of a risk? For those industries that have crazy multiples and valuations, oftentimes we're not going to be putting them in front of clients because they're all using SBA. So if we're not going to get it, you know, for maybe 4.55 max, if we do some crazy structuring on like performance note side, most of them, all of them are using SBA. Nobody's doing a straight up. Strategic acquisition where they'd be able to pay higher than four times. So I take your point. I agree with your point. Most of the time, we probably won't be considering deals like that.

39:11 - Charis Siau
  Makes sense.

39:13 - Athena Simpson
  Yeah.

39:14 - Charis Siau
  Okay.

39:14 - Athena Simpson
  So that turned into a little mini training. I don't think Anke's seen this before, have you?

39:20 - Anke Jordaan
  No, I've seen you and Luke go back and forth on it, but it's cool.

39:24 - Athena Simpson
  Yeah. So I'm thinking we need to bump this actually, Luke. And I was thinking like adding 0.5 to everything. What do you think? Yeah, I agree.

39:37 - Luke Gillespie
  Like I said before, this is subjective valuation, but I just kept, and I'm jaded by the realities of being on market every day, but I just kept seeing it come in way under what the market would value.

  ACTION ITEM: Use base multiple evaluation tool alongside write-ups; save copy with business name & AcquiMatch ID in designated folder
 - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/373289201?timestamp=2381.9999

39:50 - Athena Simpson
  Yeah, let's try that. And then what you guys can do, like we're sharing the link with you, but just make a copy every time you're doing a write-up. Yeah. And fill it out and include that with the write-up so that we're temperature checking this tool and the business every single time. And then it gives us a list of things that all of you are looking at in every deal. So it's creating a level of standardization with what we're looking at in terms of risk factors.

40:19 - Luke Gillespie
  Another question I have about this is on EBITDA.

40:23 - Charis Siau
  I think in this space, we're looking more at SD calculations.

40:30 - Athena Simpson
  Always SDE?

40:31 - Charis Siau
  Okay. Okay. Good question.

40:35 - Athena Simpson
  Yeah. All of our clients are planning on being owner-operators.

40:41 - Charis Siau
  Yep. Yep. They might.

40:44 - Athena Simpson
  I mean, that will give them having the operator in place. And that's the thing. I'm kind of like, this will be a fun tool for us to do something and then them to make it their own. You know, because an owner-operator might bump it higher and they're willing to. But then it... Gives them some sort of like way of articulating the things that are important to them in how that reflects in their valuation, you know? So having a GM in place like is awesome, but since all of them are taking PGs with SBA, like we don't take them on as clients if they think they're going to be an absentee owner. Yeah. Because I can't in good conscience, you know, like, you know, there's very, very, very few businesses that you can actually do that. And do you want to do that when you're taking a personal guarantee and your house is on the line when you're doing so like, you know, maybe you'll get there eventually where you can have a GM. But when I was at the acquisition.com workshop and they were doing this, they're like, yeah, until you're at like 3 million in EBITDA, you're likely always going to have key man risk, you know?

41:58 - Charis Siau
  And I was like.

42:00 - Athena Simpson
  From the private equity side or from like the investor side, it's like they see key man risk until 3 million in EBITDA, which, you know, I'm like, okay. So people are like, yeah, I want to like $500k SDE business and with an operator in place.

42:14 - Charis Siau
  So I'm like, okay, good luck. I haven't, but I knew that, right?

42:21 - Athena Simpson
  I just didn't know what number people were kind of considering as like, what's the number before you maybe could be truly absentee or not? So you said before you want us attaching this to write-ups now.

42:38 - Luke Gillespie
  So do you want this to be presented to clients with every write No, no, no, not yet.

42:42 - Athena Simpson
  But just when, when, when you like for our deal reviews, like, and then when you guys are submitting the write-ups to me, Anke, this was a question I was going to ask is like in those folders, is all of it client facing or is a section of it client? Facing if they were to put the, you know how we do like the deal calculator into the deal folders?

43:07 - Anke Jordaan
  Currently the entire folder is client facing. So they take the entire folder with the deal calculator, the SIM, all the P&Ls, and they push it to the client.

43:17 - Athena Simpson
  So is there maybe a folder that we can just keep the scorecards for now until we make this client facing? Or can you figure out something like that? Just easy for them. Maybe in whatever folder this is currently in, just making a copy and keeping it in the same folder. When you guys make a copy, just make sure you're renaming it with the business name and the AcquiMatch ID number. But yeah, I would like to see these alongside every write-up, but no, Luke, let's not put it to the clients yet until we feel like we've refined this enough that we're like, okay. And we're going to manage their expectations, right? This is not, this is not like an official valuation. Can't. Be putting this in front of the broker and be like, well, my advisor said, right? But I, this is a personal decision for people. So if we can get some sort of standardization RSI that they can then build on, you know, and add the features in that are super important to them, then it gives them a tool to kind of like, okay, well, how far do I want to push the asking price? It's got literally everything I want. So maybe I do want to go on the higher end and I feel good about that, you know, but we just haven't been able to give them anything like this to be able to make those calls, you know, and I feel weird saying it's personal to you. You got to look at the cashflow, you know, after debt service and everything and see how you feel about that. There's, there's gotta be a different way to also give them a gut check. So I'm excited to use this as a tool and see if we can get it to a place where we're comfortable putting it in front of them.

44:57 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah. I mean, I'm comfortable with it. After this adjustment, we can test it out a couple times, but I'd feel pretty comfortable with it.

45:06 - Athena Simpson
  Sweet. Yeah, I am too. I'm feeling like it's good, and it'll be fun to get them to choose two or three things that are super important to them, either deal breakers or this would be a no-brainer. I'm going to share it in the chat, then, Anke, can we make sure this gets into the process somehow when they're doing write-ups, like what folder to save it in and something there. Okay, cool. What was the last stuff on the agenda? Any questions, actually, before we move on?

45:43 - Ryan Cash
  Yeah, with regards to the folder that has the SIM information that we're not going to include this spreadsheet in, starting with that, Luke, are you adding those links to HubSpot? Or is that in Ray's yardage? Yeah, I don't do that.

46:06 - Luke Gillespie
  That's either Ray or David. I don't do that. Okay, gotcha.

46:12 - Anke Jordaan
  Wait, Ryan, can I actually just explain the question that you're asking?

46:17 - Luke Gillespie
  The deal file link, Anke, the Google Drive, the deal files, that link. folder?

46:23 - Anke Jordaan
  Yeah.

46:24 - Luke Gillespie
  The Drive folder?

46:25 - Anke Jordaan
  Yeah, that's just part of an automated process. As soon as the deal gets created, it creates a folder. It attaches it into HubSpot and then, so that's where that link comes from.

46:35 - Ryan Cash
  Yeah, I was just, I didn't see that kind of on the process. So I was just making sure I wasn't the one who needed to add that link into HubSpot.

46:46 - Anke Jordaan
  Now, every deal you touch, you already have that link in.

46:49 - Ryan Cash
  Cool. Yeah.

46:50 - Luke Gillespie
  Don't worry, everything you need to do is in the place.

46:55 - Athena Simpson
  So Anke, something Luke mentioned was that he didn't know how to make a deal Bye-bye. go Okay. HubSpot before, so I didn't say something, but I think every one of them should know how to do that, just in case Ray's off sick or something, right?
  ACTION ITEM: Schedule training for Luke, Ryan, Cash on creating deals in HubSpot
 - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/373289201?timestamp=2821.9999  Like, if they need to make a deal on HubSpot. So can you do some training on that for all three of them? So if they need to, they can.

47:18 - Anke Jordaan
  Cool.

47:19 - Athena Simpson
  Okay. So let's see. Other thing I wanted to ask. So we have been putting the quick calculator in the deal files for the clients from the beginning, but that's because we didn't have the modeling tool that we have now. And Peter just took the quick calc and tried to use that. And I was like, maybe it's confusing because you have, you use it to do a calculation for the write-up, but I don't think we should be including it in the deal folder for clients anymore. So we avoid that confusion. Like what Peter had, I wanted to. Bring it up to see if I'm missing anything major that might cause an issue there if we were to do that.

48:08 - Luke Gillespie
  No, I think that sounds like a great idea. It was a useful tool earlier in the business back when we didn't have these other tools.
  ACTION ITEM: Update process docs to remove quick calculator from client-facing deal folders; inform Ray to stop including it
 - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/373289201?timestamp=2891.9999  Now that we have the more complex financial model, I know you want to be pushing clients to using that anyways. So I think that's a great idea. And it's an easy change. think we just have to tell Ray, stop updating the, putting that in the files. We'll explain it to clients maybe in a call if they start asking why it's missing. But yeah, I think that's a great idea. Okay, good.

48:35 - Athena Simpson
  So what might be cool to add to the template then is the link to financial modeling and the link to preparing for broker calls. So it's like in every write-up, we're just pointing them, signposting them to where they need to go next.

48:52 - Anke Jordaan
  Okay. Yeah, and that could be added like in the next step section.

48:55 - Luke Gillespie
  So after they finish reviewing the write-up, next steps, click here to prepare for broker calls, click here. Start your financial modeling. I like that. Yeah.

49:03 - Athena Simpson
  Prepare your talk track from your broker calls. Reminder, here's your resource. Like here's the resource for financial modeling. If you want to start modeling this out, um, then that way we're pushing them where they need to go within that document that they're reviewing. Um, so yeah, but to be clear, Luke, you'll still use the quick calculator behind the scenes to do the calculation for the write-up.

49:29 - Luke Gillespie
  And then Anke, you want to collab on making that, that update to the write-up template. can collab on that. Yeah.

49:35 - Anke Jordaan
  To the template and then the, the, just process documents as well.

49:40 - Luke Gillespie
  Sounds good.

49:40 - Anke Jordaan
  And then Ray, of course, the one that's actually putting the deal calculator in the folder.

49:45 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah. Okay, good.

49:47 - Athena Simpson
  Um, do you guys mind if we end this quickly so I can get a breather and a coffee before I get put on the spot for some financial modeling?

49:56 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah. Just, just, just before, I just want to make sure you're set up for everything at the Do you need anything prepped? want me to pull the files and give them to you? Or are you just going to open everything up live? Oh, it would be amazing if you had the...

50:08 - Athena Simpson
  So I have the P&L, because that was a monster file from the first one.

50:12 - Luke Gillespie
  I have it downloaded on my computer. But for the other ones, if you can just have the P&L links ready to go to send to me, that's what I'm going to dive into. Okay. I can send you a DM on Slack right now.

50:25 - Athena Simpson
  Rather than Slack, maybe just drop it in the chat. Oh, you won't be able to do it directly. Yeah, Slack will be fine. I'll figure out how to see that in the DMs in Slack. Okay. Or I can send it to Anka.

50:43 - Luke Gillespie
  I can DM it to Anka, whatever's used to it.

50:45 - Anke Jordaan
  I'm not on those calls. That's the problem.

50:48 - Luke Gillespie
  But Luke is on those calls.

50:50 - Athena Simpson
  No, no, no. It's fine. Just DM it to me, Luke. I'll just open Slack. All right.

50:54 - Luke Gillespie
  I'll do that right now. So you have the first one. I'll give you the two options for the JB one. Okay, perfect. Yeah. Thanks, guys. Okay, see you in a few minutes. Bye.
