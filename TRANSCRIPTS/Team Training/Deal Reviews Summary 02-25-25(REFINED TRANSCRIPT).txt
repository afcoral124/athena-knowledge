  Okay, cool. right, I thank you for the update you said, but that's actually really helpful on Tuesdays. I don't know if you're prepping for these calls anyway, but just for me to wrap my head around where they're at since it's like Tuesday calls are the so I don't know if that's too hard to do a little bit in advance, but it was really helpful.  Luke had.

5:25 - AcquiMatch Team
  That was good. you want me to just maybe put like a time in my calendar to kind of just sit down, summarize that, send you that message, maybe around the same time I sent it today, that way you can just kind of have that ready.

5:39 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  That would be amazing. Yeah. Like midday on Tuesdays, so I could just like kind of get my head around like, what conversations am I going to pull off?  Gil normally keeps his video off and he didn’t today. That's why I didn't call on him to talk about customer concentration, but Luke and I were just briefly talking about that before you joined the call today.  So, um, I think it's a learning topic for us as far as customer concentration goes to talk about that too.  Um, so Luke, to your understanding, you were saying it's like a big school district, but you weren't sure is it like one budget holder that like this one person signs off the budget and then they have to interact with the different schools or is it each school has a budget and this is an approved contractor for the district but there's like a bunch of different people that they get paid money from.

6:41 - Luke Gillespie
  No, I believe they have a direct relationship with the county as a whole and they're signed on to be the IT provider for the entire school district.  I'm sorry, not county, entire school district. I don't think it's a school by school thing. Um, they've been, they've been working  at this school district for years. Again, it's the number four or five largest school district in the country, which I know is surprising in Nevada, but I did some due diligence and it turns out it's true.
  SCREEN SHARING: Luke started screen sharing - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/239844102?timestamp=434.063447  And right, it's the one school district, but last year, 2023, it brought in $2.6 million of revenue. So this is what the cash flow would look like for Gil at the end of the day, 1.8 DSCR.  And there's even another caveat is the lender that pre-approved it, this local Nevada bank has a relationship with the school district as well.  So the president of that bank has a relationship with one of the heads at the school district, so they can help transfer that relationship.  And obviously, there's ways that Gil can structure the deal to diversify this risk away. Like if the school district relationship doesn't transfer over, then the seller wouldn't get paid.  But Okay, you understand why I was asking the question and the way I was. No, I understand what you're saying and I'm saying I don't have the answer that I didn't get the details on that.  What exactly their point of contact is at the school.

8:12 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  I don't have the answer to that. Okay, because I just want to make sure like. And it's okay if you don't know this, but there's, there's like.  There are caveats to customer concentration that clients might not understand so like it's an opportunity for us to like dive a little bit deeper and educate them where there's like, you know, an adjustment or like a small risk versus a large risk.  Um, so customer concentration is one of those things. It's, it's like, it's not just all straightforward if. Um, it appears like it's one customer, but actually there's a bunch of different customers within the same brand or the same company or the same district.

8:58 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah, I get what you're saying. Yeah. Given if it's the fourth fifth largest school district in the country, obviously, there's a bunch of different schools There's this huge multi-million dollar project of shifting their ERP system.  That's coming up in the next few years and given that This company is their trusted service provider most likely they're gonna win this bid But it's not guaranteed right since it's a public the government entity They have yeah, but most likely these guys are gonna get the bid right So I'm just Tried yeah, so they have multi-year managed services agreement with the school district generating several million dollars in annual revenue The contract is anticipated to be renewable ensuring long-term stability and growth potential So the story is in 2018 They had a huge crash with their system their ERP system and this guy the current owner who is a very experienced IT guy He also has a private IT company who services private clients Just started up this company for us to take over handling this school district and so for the last few years they've  just been handling this school district. And that's what that's the purpose of this company. On a side note, there's even this guy, this owner, he recently secured a contract with a tribal casino in Northern California.  That's expected to add a 250,000 SDE. And it hasn't been wrapped into this company yet, but they were thinking about including it into the deal to make the company bigger and make the selling price bigger.  They're also in an active RFP, request for proposal for a school district on the east coast. I believe the group has said New York, New Jersey area.  So Gil could really take this company anywhere.

10:45 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay. Cool. So oh, this can be run remote then with it being in Nevada.

10:55 - Luke Gillespie
  Oh, yeah, they all they work all the employees, the owner, they all. No, it sounds like maybe this private one might be much larger.  And again, the story kind of is that this public one that I presented to Gil kind of just sprung up because of this emergency of the critical IT failure at the school district in 2018.

12:22 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So yeah, I don't because you have a competitor issue with the the owner. So he's running like, first of all, I'd want to know like, why did he set up this business?  Like he was running an IT business.

12:45 - Luke Gillespie
  Why didn't he just run this client through the existing business? And I think they did eventually because the broker was telling me the numbers are funky because they were commingling funds.  He said the school district messed up and was actually paying executive options, his private service, private company servicing IT company.  then recently, in like the last year or two, they straightened things out and got the books all accurate. So obviously, I included that in the notion like, you know, obviously your queue of your accountant is going to do a very good job looking at this and you're going to make what you'll make sure they take a look at this.  But right, because I asked him like, oh, did you improve these margins so well? And he said, yeah, they kind of messed up the books.  They were actually, the school district was invoicing his private company, right? And they just fixed the books recently was his explanation.

13:45 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, so I think these are, these are things like just, you know, kind of identifying some of these things earlier on.

13:52 - Luke Gillespie
  So it's, you know, we got, I have a business, but I'm just pulling this out for your own learning to like some things we can ask like earlier on.  And then

14:00 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Ryan and you can coach him to ask these questions as you go through the process. So things that immediately jump out is like, it's a red flag to me that he has two different businesses doing the same thing.  Like, even though the differentiation is private clients versus like a school district, like why is it carved this one out?  Usually you carve out the problem child and get rid of it, you know? And also, typically you want the owners to sign a non-compete.  So that means that if he's like dominating the private sector in this territory, then that would mean that Gil would be in competition with this dude if he wanted to go non-public sector.  So it sounds like the idea for this company is like only public sector.

14:51 - Luke Gillespie
  Thank you.

14:53 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, but like why? You know, like that's why I'm like, I don't wanna like double click on that one and figure out what's going on there.

15:00 - Luke Gillespie
  air because that seems weird to me like if this was such a great business why is he carving it out and selling it and also why is he selling it do we know he's selling it um yeah what did the broker said he just said um it's in the call somewhere I guess I didn't write down the note I think it's just he's moving on he's he's kind of done with it uh you know one of those things like oh he's just he's done his time he's ready to move on I'm like I'm pulling up the call right now but he's gonna keep doing the other business yeah yeah do you see where I am skeptical yeah I get what you're saying um okay so why is he selling uh yeah he wants to focus on his other company the one that does the private clients the broker's words where he wants to take the money and do some other endeavors and focus on the other company hmm did you want to take the money and do the other endeavors with  Yeah, so he just decided it's the time to move on and he wants to focus on that other company that faces the private clients more.

16:15 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Did you have good rapport with the broker at this point?

16:19 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah, he was a really nice guy.

16:21 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Ask why like twice more times like not exactly like but the reason for leaving. The broker will give you some like packaged answer, right?  Like that's a packaged answer. So I'd be like, oh really? So he's not retiring like why is he choosing one business over the other?  And then he'll give you some packaged answer and then you want to ask again, right?

16:46 - Luke Gillespie
  Like so instead of being like just because it's going to sound weird if you're like but why but why?

16:51 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  But that's kind of in your head that you want to get to like it's almost like five levels of why.  How you get to the real answer of something?

17:00 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah.

17:00 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  But in, in this case, it sounds like, so the reason for selling is so important for us to understand.

17:10 - Luke Gillespie
  And a lot of times people are selling problems. Yeah.

17:17 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Right. they don't, of course, they're not going to say that. the broker's definitely not going to say that. So what we needed to, and it's like, it's okay if there's problems there, right?  Because it might be the kind of problem that will get our client out of bed and they'll be happy to solve.  But we do have an opportunity to be a little bit more sophisticated in the way that we ask these things and how we advise the clients earlier on, especially if, you know, I know sometimes the brokers are like, rah, but like, forgetting along at this point that you can be like, whoa, so why is he focusing on one business over the other?  Do they do the same thing? You know, like, I would just, I would just play dumb and like call out the obvious, but it is the obvious, right?  Like, so he's going to do the exact same thing for another business. Why not this one? Why that one over that one?  know, like, why is he getting rid of this one and not just rolling it up in his current business?

18:06 - Luke Gillespie
  I don't get it. Yeah, yeah, you're right. And given this is the second time you've told me this, I just wrote it down into my question notes to in all caps, very important on the why are they selling?  totally understand what you're saying.

18:19 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  You know, I'm not just going to be like a little kid, but why? But why? I know how to keep the combo going, right?  Like, Oh, really? And then why is that? Is this other company just profiting better or something like that? get what you're saying.  Yeah. Yeah, but like, you almost want to of ask it three different ways, at least three times, right? And even digging down the digging down, if and like without getting them on the defensive, like at this point, I'm like, hopefully I have a good good rapport with them and I'll be like, well, why do you think they're selling like they've got two businesses doing the same thing?  why are they just rolling it up? You know, so then it's a discussion amongst peers about like why that might be as opposed to like you putting them on the spot and trying to catch them on something, because they will get defensive if

19:00 - Luke Gillespie
  there's something to hide there, which they're to, you know, there's there's something here that's weird.

19:04 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Um, and then so that that helps with the clients too in terms of helping them understand the strategy there and or the things that they're going need to build in.  Like, is this dude willing to sign in on compete? Why, like, is he going to stay away from like he's still doing the same thing?  So what's the stop him from selling off this contract, essentially, which is what it is. It's like a business with one contract and then going after all the other school districts and the, you know, is he going to stay away from school districts to be selling this and saying like this is going to be like a school district thing.  Is there some methodology for how to get school district contracts, like whatever, um, the non compete. So just just so you understand kind of down the line, it's really important that the, the outgoing owner is not going to be competitive with the new owner and they will need to sign non compete.  So that effect. If they have good lawyer, if our buyers have good lawyers behind them, so you don't need to necessarily talk about the non compete, but I just want you to have the kind of like end goal in mind so that you can kind of get the answers earlier up if that's going to be an issue.

20:14 - Luke Gillespie
  No, yeah, I know you're right. And that's it's so obvious, not only the non compete, you never even bring it up, but I just Ctrl+F’d the CIM and it wasn't mentioned.  So, yeah, I get what you're Things I should have thought about some good questions you're thinking about.

20:33 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, unless there's like, the reason for selling if it's like, they bought house in Florida and they want to go to Florida, or they have a health problem and they have to get out of the business.  Like, this is like a really legit. Like, oh, okay, yeah, I totally get it. And also if they're like, I have health problems, I might not be alive in three months and it's like we also need to know that so we can be like, is that going to be enough time to get this closed and transition.  Um, you know, we're seeing how health problems are like such an impact on Alex. Imagine that that would be for somebody trying to, you know, take over from the owner versus like they genuinely want to retire versus they've already, if they've made some commitment somewhere else, like they bought house in another state and they want to move there.  And this is the only thing holding them back. Then it's like, okay, they're motivated solider as opposed to, I hate working with the school district because it's a bunch of red tape and , and I want to get rid of this division.  Let me see if I can sell it off as its own thing.

21:37 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah. And because this seller is very open to staying on to help with the transition, he's very open to a broker saying he would even be willing to help stay on to help with some business development and client meetings.  So I don't know, I guess to play devil's advocate, I would just bring up and say, well, serving the public sector client versus the private sector client is going to be very different.  And like you just said, I'm sure serving the private sector client. Kind of just much smoother, much easier, it's probably much more intellectually stimulating or industry stimulating than probably using the newest tools and gadgets, and it's probably also much more profitable.  maybe that's why he's trying to offload the public sector, the one school district he's working with. I'm sorry.

22:16 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  There's problems that we don't know about. They're changing their RFP process. They're making all contractors re-bid. They're, I don't know, right?  So it's like, this feels like put my spidey senses up. So like, that's something for you to do earlier on.  And then Ryan can help coach Gil through the questions that he needs to be asking for him to learn, right?  So that's one thing and like, you know, we should always be pushing the clients even even more like when we meet with the owner, finding out, digging into the why are you selling?  Why are you selling? Because like Jason was just talking about, you know, Tariq not knowing what he's going to do and it's been his identity for 35 years.  Like that can be the thing that can end up stopping a deal from going forward as the owner just gets called fate and changes their mind.  So we need to know on a scale of like, they're absolutely selling and there's nothing stopping them to they're entertaining the idea and they're not sure about it.  We kind of need to try to get a professional gauge for our clients. we also know how to like guide them and push them into.

23:25 - Luke Gillespie
  Uh-huh, got it.

23:27 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Um, so then on the customer concentration point, I think it's a good discussion for all of us to have because I was actually talking to Lindsay and Kevin about this yesterday.  Um, wait, no, Sunday, sorry, for some reason I lost today. Um, so they said, you know, it appeared like we had a customer concentration issue because all of the contracts were coming from like a majority of one client, but it was actually one company, but multiple.  whole budget owners. So like, even if they lost the budget from one person within that company, they weren't going to lose all the others.  So they were a bunch of different customers, but from the same company.

24:13 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah.

24:15 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So when we hear customer concentration, that's something for us too. In the vetting stage, sorry, I keep using double click because Lindsay put it in something for us to, you know, like dig a little bit deeper on.  It's like, is this really a customer concentration issue? Or is it, you know, a bunch of customers within the same brand, or the same school district, or for example, the shop that I was talking to myself a couple years ago, they were the like a recommended supplier for a franchise company, but it was a bunch of the franchisees.  who all had their own budgets and their own, you know, so they were getting a bunch of different paychecks from a bunch of different people all with the same brand.  So that's why I was asking with the school district, is it one check gets deposited in their account every month from one person?

25:18 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah.

25:19 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Or is it multiple school districts depositing their respective checks to this person? Like, what's the risk? Like, if one person says we're no longer working with this person, it's all revenue go away overnight.

25:37 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah, I get what you're saying because it could be just like one client, the one school district, or it's this district has 360 schools and 360 clients.  So I get what you're saying. Yeah. So definitely want to do more deep dive into that. And I don't really think the broker would have known the answers to those questions, but I should definitely ask them next time.  Ryan, assume because I think deals doing a broker call with this guy, I assume you're going to relay this over to Gil, give him a coaching session on it.  But yeah, thanks. Thanks for the advice, Athena. Definitely a lot of good extra questions we can ask.

26:18 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, where are you at with it with Gil, Brian?

26:21 - AcquiMatch Team
  Yeah, so I heard through his concerns and, you know, the primary one being that customer concentration and you're going to have to grill right on that and see what that's about.  this isn't one on a first call. You're going to be like, let me get to know you. You're going to need to be like, hey, nice to meet you.  do have some media concerns. I want to get these right out the way. And if you can address those, let's get to the rest of my questions.  That's even some of the broker calls look, I do that, right? So it's like if I identify a literally, if this is a no, then it's not going make a sense.  I just will like introduce myself, talk to the broker and be like, Hey, like I got a list of questions or I'd love to run through if you if that works for you, and I'm gonna start with one that's really important here actually might be a deal breaker for us So I don't want to waste any of your time.  I thought we could just maybe just get right to it. Is that sound okay? They'll usually go yes, perfect, right?

27:16 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah, they want they want to get right to it too, right?

27:20 - AcquiMatch Team
  Right, I'll be like so there's one contracts, you know You it looks like a doing two million revenue great However, what if this person doesn't renew next year?  does what does the buyer do? Right, and I would just say it right there and just let them see what happens So yeah, I talked to you and Gil kind of brought that up and I was like, yeah, you need to we need to figure that out ASAP So I was kind of like we kind of went through the things of what Like there's great rights the IT part great Government contracts can be great right a lot of time.  It's just money. They don't ask questions, right? And long you do a good job, you just kind of fly into the radar.  So there's some cool things there. But the biggest one is like, especially after that story from her and on, I'm sure this is fresh.  like, what if he just doesn't get the contract renewed? And it's just one, right? And it seems like this guy, the seller, has a relationship with that school district.  And that's how he does that. And that's why he has no other school districts, right? he has some type of relationship with someone from this area.  so he got it, he has it. And what Athena was saying is like, why is he selling it then?  If it's passive and he's running this kind of side business and doing really well, then why sell it? Because it looks like it's just turning in money and he has a bunch of part-time people running it.  And his friends in school districts, like, why would you sell that? maybe, and I told Gil, do the call, get right to that point.  Like, what's up with this customer comment? on track. Okay, I understand. Why would you sell this? Because it looks like a pretty sweet setup.  So that's my next concern. So so that's where we're gills at. And I said, just, this is a good another experience for a broker call, like get on the call and just like, you have what's going to be a deal breaker for you, get right to that.  And if he addresses those and you feel good about it, then go to the rest of your questions. Okay, good.  I appreciate that explanation. And then we'll talk about it afterwards. But if you if he just says, yeah, there's no guarantees like that contract or ill, and he's selling, we talked a little bit about he has a competing business as well, even though it's it's private sector.  So I said, address that as well be like, you know, why are you ready to kind of similar style businesses and then getting rid of one, we talked about that.  What was the other thing I told them to to look at? Oh, the other thing was, is that I told, and you included it, and it's good point, right?  This little thing about, you know, he has this, this other potential opportunity, right? Luke, talking about what is it?  you me?

30:14 - Luke Gillespie
  you me or something? Yeah, Northern California.

30:18 - AcquiMatch Team
  So the only thing is, like, almost any seller you talk to, they're always going to have this pie in the sky thing that's going to happen in the future to try to hook you in, right?  And that's like always going to exist. So I always say, I don't even look at anything in the future of anything they're talking about.  I only look at past performance and just see what is the business like now, right? you can throw, if I'm happy with the businesses like now and how the financials were for the last few years and the contracts, great.  if you want to put some gravy on top and then say, and then there's that, this opportunity, interesting, right?  But I would say just start here. I would say just ignore this potential opportunity with the ending that's him trying to offload that that even worries me a little bit more Maybe he's now he's trying to offload this so much that he's trying to throw in and I'll throw in this contract with any casino that I haven't even landed yet, right?

31:15 - Luke Gillespie
  No, they they signed the contract. That is what he said. The broker said they have it on the books.  He has it. just hasn't decided to put it in his private company or in this other one.

31:26 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  What the hell is what the broker is saying?

31:31 - Luke Gillespie
  He's he's saying he could throw this into the pot if interested in that. That was I just mentioned in the additional info part of my right.

31:40 - AcquiMatch Team
  Oh, sorry. Go on. I'm going say like that's a tactic, right? that's So like just understand like the brokers, the brokers.  What are their incentives, right? And that's why like I was talking about I think and Dean says he has a packaged response because he's incentivized to say good  things about this business regardless, right? And so you have to like play that game, but then understand like, but there's certain points where you need to know an answer.  And so you like cut through the package answer be like, yeah, what's the real answer here? Because I actually, I need this one, right?  And whoa, you really? Okay, gotta, right? So it's all good. This is all stuff that I learned over years and you're learning right now.  But the best thing that we can do and you never know that we get this together. I love this.  I could do this and this this with this is perfect. We don't know that until we present it to him.  But the best thing is like, we want to think through in his shoes, what are his concerns going to be and try to address those before we present to him so that when we do present to him, it's like, Hey, this is a concern.  The broker only gave me so much of a response, probably only going to get the real info if we get you to a seller call on this one.

32:53 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah.

32:55 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, that area is a clarification section is why that exists in the right up because there's only so much we know the broker is going to tell us but what we need to do is identify those areas where we know the broker is not giving us enough information and then we're we're giving the buyer that heads up like hey broker was cagey or was keeping his cards close to his chest but these are the areas I'm concerned about you need to get clarified right like they didn't give us enough information this is weird as you go through this process you want to be aware of it so um and I agree with Ryan right like it's good for us to sell them on the business but we want to like if nothing changed in this business this is a direct hit that's what we need to be thinking about with these write-ups and when we present it to clients it's like are we selling them on a direct hit if nothing changes not the potential the potential is additional upside  is this business as it is right now hitting all my parameters and if nothing changed would I be happy with it yeah it's so easy in a relationship or potential relationship you meet someone and you're like thank god you have so much potential and if you did all the things you said you were gonna do you'd be so great we'd be so great together and it's like none of those things may happen so am i gonna be happy with this this person as they are if nothing changes you know and it's like doesn't feel good to be on them receiving into that as a person and also doesn't feel good to resent the person so it's the same thing with a business right like um so it's awesome when there is potential upside but and and clients will the really excited clients they'll sell themselves on all the reason why it's gonna be great after they make the changes but you know that discussion today like do not touch a  thing in that business for at least the first 90 days if not six months especially if you're a new business owner and you've never done  this before like as long as you could possibly go before you feel like I can do this without asking the owner any questions and I will be able to maintain the revenue and the profit margin without the owner here because I understand the business that deeply then you can start making changes right?

36:18 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah you're right I get what you're saying and I've heard that relationship with advice as well don't try to change your partner and be happy with who they are yeah it's hard Women are especially gifted at like falling in love with the potential of men so I'm 41 and I'm still learning this lesson but I see people do that a lot with business they'll talk themselves into a bad deal because they're falling in love with the potential and what they think they can do versus what it actually is and that's a recipe for bankruptcy you know?

36:54 - AcquiMatch Team
  True yeah that's what that's what that conversation was with Andrew recently me about that business he was looking at.  He kind of fell in lovely, so excited and then slowly coming down from it. It's a risky, risky opportunity.

37:09 - Luke Gillespie
  You're right.

37:11 - AcquiMatch Team
  Yeah, that's.

37:13 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah, but that's our job. That's what we're here to do. We're here to crush dreams and break hearts.

37:18 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, you know, and but like, did you notice how both Jason and Joe are talking much differently about the deals?  It's like they went through the emotional roller coaster where they were like in love and worried about losing these deals.  then both of them look like, you know, Joe got another option. Jason got another option. And now they're just kind of like accepting where it's at.  Like, I imagine Ryan had a lot to do with that. But see that the way they talk about it and the differences and the way they talk about deals when they've gone through the emotional roller coaster with it.

37:52 - AcquiMatch Team
  was good. It took me on that roller coaster with it. was like, you know, I'm like, Oh, I'm listening.  I'm talking I'm listening to their anxiety and they're stressed out about this and I'm trying to like keep them and It's it's interesting.  It's Yeah Just advising me man, it's like there's they're putting that kind of stress Out there and you can feel it on them So yeah, it's good.  It's good on I think you know here you talk on those calls and them to hear you talk and and that kind of stuff because I think cuz they're on the group calls.  They're a little bit more cheerful with When they talk with me a little bit more anxious, you know So It's good that they keep they hear from you on those calls.

38:41 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  I appreciate it Yeah, I mean, you know, I'm just backing up what you're going through to, you know, so I think it's like hearing it almost feel like it wasn't us discussing the strategy around them around you know and like just Hearing it from other sources and in front of people  like, you hear things differently and it brings you down to earth. But my God, like, I, I, I've been in it, you know, like, I've been running after these deals, like even the car wash, I was like, losing my mind over it.  And I was in Bali, trying to like be on in Bali. And I was like, on the side of a road with all these  mopeds flying by, trying to talk to John, because I was afraid I was going to lose this deal, you know, like, it was never going to work.  numbers were, we were so far off, like, he was like, I want 6 million. And I was like, I will give you 1.2, you know, that's my top offer.  And you will rent the real estate to me. some real estate developers, I'm, I'm positive. I don't know how long it's going to be there.  But, um, yeah, it's just, like, I didn't need to be on my holiday in Bali, talking to the stupid, but it was the only deal I had in hand, you know, so this was like the scarcity mindset, like, takes you over.  And the adrenaline kicks in and hits so much differently when you like a business, you know, like all of a sudden something that was theoretical is now something that you could potentially lose.  When you first start dating someone and you realize you like them and then it's like the worst part of the relationship because the fear of losing something you don't have yet is like it creates all that anxiety and you're like, I don't know if they like me back and like, what's happening and like, like, it's the worst, but like it should I text them?  Am I allowed to like, it's happening? It's just, it's horrible. I hate, I hate that initial stages, you know, because you just don't know what the hell's going on and you're now that you realize you like them, you can lose it.  So it's kind of the same thing with the business. that's if you have no other opportunities or not dating anyone else and this is the first thing that came along in a really long time that you like, it's like, I don't want to lose it.

41:00 - Luke Gillespie
  I mean Yeah Yeah, Jason especially though, right and yeah As I've been telling Luke this like we need to get so I'm telling you if this falls out.

41:13 - AcquiMatch Team
  He's gonna blow up I'm telling you right and so Kind of has like that. He's messaging me saying he wants to talk about his deal box Luke got him something he's saying that he's he's like when you talk about my deal boxes isn't fitting my deal box but it is he told me this last time that he wants something run a hundred thousand if you can do it this less than this many hours a week, but You know Jason is he'll just blur out things and then we have to revisit the conversation.  So I'm gonna do that with him tomorrow But it's true though It's like this is all part of the things that we're learning about how to make our clients happy and stuff like that Like anticipating these kind of things.  I'm like, okay. He has something right now and he's excited about it and he has this kind of other one, but if this follows through, we know immediately he's going to go to where are my deals and he and he has, right?  And so we got to be proactive about the stuff to try to keep those things away. So anyways, that so if you're working on one Luke right now, so yeah, have that ready, make it and then actually just don't just get him to sign the NDA and I'll review it.  Yeah, maybe I can just, I just want to review it before it gets sent and then we'll have my call with him tomorrow.

42:45 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah, yeah, he'll get it before the call tomorrow.

42:58 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  When the clients make changes, just sort of deal boxes. Are you putting it in writing anywhere to them?

43:15 - AcquiMatch Team
  No, I haven't done.

43:18 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  I would like have a sense that I think it's still doing the summaries of the deal boxes anyway as part of their onboarding and she's doing the summaries of your calls.  If there's an adjustment to the deal box, I would almost like have it have her grab any adjustments or you tell her what the adjustments are.  Are you still there?

43:46 - AcquiMatch Team
  Just down.

43:48 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  You what?

43:49 - AcquiMatch Team
  this down.

43:50 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay, so I would, you know, either you need it or yourself and just like send a message and slack and be like based on  conversation, these are the adjustments you want made to your deal box. Is this correct? Because it's good that you're having those conversations with them, but also just covering our own , especially with someone like Jason, right?  like the Jason's keeping us on our toes and keeping us honest, because it helps us think through how to not get these reactions from him, which will filter down in the rest of the client.  So yes, he is our loudest client, but he is just asking for what we told them we would deliver.  So but in that instance, if they're changing the deal box all the time and flip flopping back and forth, we just want to make sure we cover the tracks and then also get them to like say, yep, that is what I want you to do.  So just be like, These are the adjustments that you're going to make to your deal box. Is this correct?  Yes. And then I would say, okay, it's a couple week drag when you make changes to the deal box, just so you know.  Oh, so we might have, would you still like to look at anything that was coming through that was like in the old deal box because every time you make a change, we know it takes about two weeks, right, to get a deal over the line, hopefully sooner or whatever, but just like managing their expectations that like we are going to now look for new things that take some time from us to change the parameters and look for new stuff.  If it's a huge deviation from what they were doing before. So I guess the first thing is put it in writing, make sure the whole team also like, where are we storing the changes to the deal box and is that getting updated so the whole team is aware of it.  you know, if David's going to be looking for deals of front and loops verifying them and that sort of thing.  And, you know, I imagine you could utilize Eda for that or maybe David and Eda can figure out a process since he's going to be at the beginning looking through it, but also getting them to agree in writing.  Yes. And like, okay, this means it might be a little bit of a delay. before we can get you other deals, do you want us to keep sending you deals from the old parameters if we come across any?

46:09 - AcquiMatch Team
  Good idea.

46:10 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Because that will buy us some time. It makes sure that they're actually realizing that every time they change it, A, that you're changing things, so it changes the whole team, right?  there's a there's a backlog and a thing that changes and like three people before it gets to Ryan or them that are like going through the process.  Or if we're counting the Psalms team now before it gets to them, so this whole effect that happens if they're going to change their deal box.  So I think managing their expectations that like, yes, we can change it. Are these the changes that you actually want?  So that if we're sending them things that hit the new deal box, like you are with Jason and he's like, that's not my deal box.  And it's like, well, it is. Luckily, you're recording all the calls and getting those notes. like in his case, we do have that documented, but I think it's just better practice with clients.  Like if they're changing the brief, If we put it in writing and get them to be like, yep, that looks good.  That can help too, because then if they know there's going to be a timing impact every time they do that, it's not like you just push button and it's like no new deals, you know, like, there's a whole chain of events that happens before it gets to their desk.

47:28 - AcquiMatch Team
  Got it.

47:28 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  And a reprogramming at the whole machine and making sure everybody on the teams on board. cool. I know we're pretty much at time.  Was there any deals or clients or anything in specific? I know we're at the end of the month project, so you guys, I don't want to keep you late because I'm sure you have a lot going on.  But is there anything I should know or anything you want to talk through before we jump off?

47:52 - Luke Gillespie
  No, I'm doing well on my end for end of month.
  ACTION ITEM: Prep/send write-up for DL. Prioritize over JB's write-up. - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/239844102?timestamp=2873.9999

47:56 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay, so we're looking on target for everybody?

47:59 - Luke Gillespie
  Yes.

48:00 - AcquiMatch Team
  Everybody, but we only have one for JB. So we're still behind there. Um, but I, I did tell Luke to still, I want to prioritize DL over JB this week, only because that one deal fell through and I want them to be happy.
  ACTION ITEM: Prep/send write-up for JB after DL's. - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/239844102?timestamp=2889.9999  And although the shame, I'd love to get JB something this week. just submitted a second, he's feeling really good and he's, he's focused on these.  so, um, I, you know, he had Luke still looking for JB, but I pushed, I was like, try to get DL up right up before JB, because I really want to get them something else.  I put out some, some time my calendar to try to look for stuff, just myself as well to see if I can get something while Luke's doing his thing.

48:47 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  What, what's the likelihood?

48:49 - Luke Gillespie
  How are you feeling about DL Luke? Sorry, I let me clarify when I, when I said I'm good on my end of month, what I mean, I have two minimums for Gil and Jason.  So they're both going to get. too. And I'm confident I can get one for JB. So I, yeah, I'm confident I can go on for JB and DL.  I don't have anything as of right now. I have a private jet brokerage I can push, but the owner is doing all of the sales when it says what what new functions would a new owner have to take over from the current owner, it's client relations and sales as with 90% of the businesses we look at.  So yeah, I'm very confident, Jason and Gill are done, they're crossed off. confident on JB, I have some good deals in the mix for him.

49:31 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  DL, I don't have anything at the moment. Yeah, it's pretty like a pretty cool business.

49:42 - Luke Gillespie
  It is very cool. It's very interesting. Yeah, it's their their geographic location. We're seeing very interesting deals. I mean, I got to do a nightclub.
  ACTION ITEM: Call jet brokerage broker. Clarify revenue booking process, sales funnel, customer acq. Determine if transactional vs active sales. - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/239844102?timestamp=2988.9999  I want to do a private jet brokerage.

49:52 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  It's interesting. So the brokerage we're holding back because the owner does all the like, what kind of sales is it though?

49:59 - Luke Gillespie
  Yes, well, That's what I'm thinking on. This is what we, this, it might be good for us just to push something like that to Destin.  Destin, Lindsey, Ryan can see their reaction and see kind of what part of sales they don't want to be doing.  Because this, you know, this is private jets. They're not cold calling knocking on doors. They're getting leads with like probably very sophisticated individuals.

50:20 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  They probably are just talking with these super high net worth individuals and kind of just understanding their travel patterns and things like that and just booking flights for them.  Yeah, I can see Destin getting really like into that too. Like, and Lindsey even from like a customer say, because what they said on the cause was like, we don't want to do any door to door sales.  Like it was, it felt like that kind of sales that they were like not interested in. So I think it's an opportunity to be like, like if you really think it's interesting and it's a solid business, Luke, and like, it doesn't feel like, excusey sales or like, you know, if it's inbound leads and they're just having to like book the customer.  and like actually, it's not like a selling process. It's like, oh, you would like a jet. Okay, let me get your parameters.  Let me go off and look with something. This is what it's going to cost. That's more transactional than it is like, salesy.  sounds like if that's what it is, then I think you're right. It's an opportunity to put it in front of them be like, Hey, your deal flow is going to be significantly less if you don't want to have any touch into anything that has to do with revenue or sales.  So we wanted to put this in front of you because this feels like a transactional kind of sale where it's inbound.  So you're having to like work on the marketing, but it is pretty cool business. And I know they're like, they feel stuck in Florida, like because of the custody arrangement with their kit.  They can't leave the state of Florida. They have a really good reason. So actually being a private jet brokerage company might open up the world and then in a way you know, honestly, like he's staying Florida, but  but if you're private jet brokerage, probably get access to private jets and like pretty cool to be able to like travel around and do that sort of thing.  So that's my initial thought on that because that sounds pretty cool. I also think we needed them specifically. It's like we really need to understand where your discomfort with sales is.  Is it full stop sales? If so, we're gonna have pretty limited deal flow for you if there's like, you know, your chief revenue officer as a business owner.  yeah, but if the owner is the one doing all the sales and it's a transactional thing, like you said, where people are getting in touch and like, I need a jet and it's like, okay, let me go find an operator for you and come back to you and quote you.  Like, that's not necessarily doing sales. Somebody is already in the, I need a jet mindset.

52:52 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah. And again, if in this situation, I'm feeling like the sales might be more of what you do with, you know, with our company, hopping on calls, getting to know them, talking them.
  ACTION ITEM: Prep/send 2nd write-up for Jason. Prioritize over other write-ups. - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/239844102?timestamp=3179.9999  I'm not just a cold call type of sale, right? 15 minute call. yeah, I'll move on that tomorrow. I will have an update by Thursday.  So we'll get right up number two for Jason tomorrow. I'll get moving on JB. should be able to get them right up by end of week.

53:17 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  I think they're going to be good. OK, awesome. Yeah. And then when you talk to the jet, just find out a little bit more about how revenue is actually booked, right?  Like, is the owner actively going out and trying to get people to switch their contacts to him? Or is he just answering inquiries about needing a jet?

53:38 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah, exactly.

53:40 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  And I understand the difference there. Like, yeah, like I would dive a little bit more into like, how do they find customers?  How does the revenue actually hit the books, right? Like, what does that process look like for them to book a jet for someone?

53:54 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah, exactly. And they have like a membership program, too. it's just repeated. They also just say client relations. Which is like very much not sale.

54:02 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So yeah, it sounds like like if somebody wants a jet, they just need a jet. You know, like if I have the money and I have the desire to book a jet, I don't need to be sold on it.  I need to know that I can get a jet with the time frames that I want and with the cost that I'm expecting and that it's gonna be reliable and it's gonna be there when I need it to be, right?

54:26 - Luke Gillespie
  Like people that kind of with jet money are very easy customers as long as you're reliable and deliver really great customer service.  It's less about the selling them because they already want the jet. Yeah, because I was gonna say, you don't have to sell them on much.

54:40 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  It's Yeah, that's cool. I mean, it sounds cool. Also, like I said, you know, when we think about our clients and like, what's their state of mind and why are they frustrated right now?  One of their frustrations is they feel stuck in Florida because of the custody arrangement. So it's got to be an exceptional business for them to go outside of Florida.  Or what about a business? this that could has the potential to get them out of Florida, right? yeah, herks, you know, that's kind of cool.  Um, so, okay, good. So sounds like we're going to end off the month with everybody getting their minimums then.

55:18 - Luke Gillespie
  Yes, except for the three we haven't been working.

55:22 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Which are a JJ BH. Okay, any word from JJ on her?

55:29 - Luke Gillespie
  I know she was speaking to Wendy yesterday. She just got our we just got the pre-qual letter yesterday.
  ACTION ITEM: Call JJ. Discuss SBA pre-qual letter, search status. Plan next steps for her deal search. - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/239844102?timestamp=3337.9999

55:34 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  How much nine million? What the  was she worried about? Okay, so can we get them to them quickly then or did we completely turn off the faucet?

55:48 - AcquiMatch Team
  I mean, I'm going call me and I heard to revisit everything that's happened and what's going on and then we'll get back there.
  ACTION ITEM: Start sending RFIs for JJ's search. Re-activate her deal flow pipeline. - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/239844102?timestamp=3348.9999  So she's supposed to schedule calls me for tomorrow.

55:59 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Great. Okay. Yeah. So like, what happened? Where did you go? Is everything okay?

56:04 - Luke Gillespie
  Like, you're ready for us to start your search again? Yeah, I mean, I can try to spin something around by the end of this week.  It might be hard, but I'm assuming we have the valid excuse to say that your search was on pause due to the SBA pre-qualification.  You know, it takes time to turn a lead into a write-up, but I can try my best. I can put her number three after DL and JB.  We could talk about that tomorrow though, Ryan.

56:31 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Well, you, I mean, you all have a call on it, but I'd say like, at least at the very least, we should be RFI-ing for her now that, yeah, so like, let's, let's, if we completely turn the faucet off and we stopped even reviewing potentials for her, like, we need to do that pretty quickly.  So that Ryan can be like, okay, we turned everything back on. Team sent like 10 RFIs yesterday. It'll be a little bit of a drag, but thank you for doing that.  what, what I don't want to do is like, we're like, hey, we're not going to do it. anything for you because you haven't done this thing, they do that thing.  And we have a huge drag in terms of where we get to there. Sorry, I know we're running over AA any word from her or we have an idea of what's going on there.

57:14 - AcquiMatch Team
  No, I haven't checked in with her. It's been eight days, I guess I could.

57:21 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, once a week, let's try to touch even even the trouble ones. Okay. Um, JQ, do you get a hold of his seller?

57:31 - AcquiMatch Team
  So I did. Oh, not good. Um, so essentially, the first thing he told me on the call was, um, he's like, I, in the whole time that since we've been introduced us Justin is not  I've not met Justin in person and seems like a great guy. He never came to see the shop. He never came to meet my team.

58:08 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  He never came to do. Yeah, that's what he started with.

58:12 - AcquiMatch Team
  And I was kind of like shocked as soon as he said, I was like, he never met you. Like the first thing I told him, he's like, I'm gonna try to see if he can play golf.  I was like, that's that might be extreme, but just get a coffee with him or something.

58:24 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah.

58:25 - AcquiMatch Team
  All is really shocked that he had never adjusted. And so he's like, so that's the first thing. And he's like, then he's like, we went back and forth with his APA.  And so he told me like a long story of all everything that happened. Told me a lot of things.  I was actually started to lean just kind of like when you're talking about EE, like I started leaning towards the buyer.  like, man, doesn't sound like Justin did this, right? And like Justin was saying that he was, that this seller was kind of like,  that the lawyer was kind of messing around with things, but he kind of put it back on Justin's like, well, his lawyer did this and this.  And I was like, so anyways, I ended and I said, okay, listen, Joe, I've heard you make a lot of great points.  I wasn't aware of the whole story. So I thank you so much for explaining that. Based off everything you said, like, I think like 90% of everything you guys are in agreement on.  And it just, it sounds like there's just a bit of a miscommunication. But I can vouch for Justin. He's a good guy.  He's a qualified buyer. And, you know, why don't I just come back in here? can, I can help talk to him.  And I think bringing you guys back to the table on this, you've already done a lot of work. And he said, Ryan, I appreciate that.  But and I've thought about this, but I've just lost confidence in Justin. I just, I don't trust that he went back and forth.  Do many times love this, did too much red mining on this, some points that I think we could have got past.  He didn't, he wasn't able to get passed on. I started taking him, like questioning him how serious he was about doing this.  When he got to said that, I was like, there are some things when I was talking to Justin, like, Justin kept saying some things.  I was like, Justin, do you want to do a deal or not? Like, you're, these are small little things.  And he was making it sound like it was the buyer making big thing. But when I talked to him, was like, no, I'm sorry.  He's making it sound like it's the seller. When I thought the seller, I did not get that buy from him.  I got the vibe that he was ready to do a deal and Justin kept putting these little things. No, it has to be this way.  And it sounds like, so I said, Look, what else are you going to do? You want, I said, no, you want to sell.  You haven't got this far because you don't want to sell. You want to be out of this. I was like, right now we got the one for you.  are you sure?" And he said, yeah, he's like, this is giving me time to reflect. And I'm, I decided I'm going to offer the business to one of my guys, and he can finance it to me.  And he said, I'm going to do that. I'm going spend the next two months talking with him, making a plan that he can find it like one of my top guys can take over the business and finance it.  And if that falls through, I'll come back to you to see if you can, if I need another buyer, I'll come to you.  All right, I understand. So, yeah, unfortunately, I think if we would have coached Justin on that business, we would have got that.  And that shows the value of what we do. Like, this was a deal. And based on that, I, know, I'm still he said, she said, but I, in my gut, I feel Justin botched it.

1:01:57 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Which is done several times before. Like, the mom times were like, do you need help? Do you want to talk through it?  Please tell us what's going on. like, and he just was not talking to us about it or anything. I am  shocked.  He's never been to go and meet the guy.

1:02:17 - AcquiMatch Team
  When you were telling me all about Justin, I didn't know because I had never actually worked with Justin that closely.  But then when he was telling the story and he was saying all these things, everything you said was like going off my head.  was like, oh my God, why did he do that? Why did he just message us and say, hey, this is what I'm thinking.  And we could have jumped in and be like, no, no, do this or do that. Like, for instance, they went straight to APA.  We could have gone, no, do a simple LOI, right? Make it, don't make it to just get something out there to get the terms out.  So it's not back and forth on this APA. That's what they did. They went back and forth on this APA for a long time.  And then he started really pushing the buyer on this indemnification of the seller on just just and start pushing the selling indemnification clause, meaning that if he got into some type of lawsuit that the fees, Justin's lawyer fees, would be covered by the seller should Justin win the suit.  And he was like, the buyer was just like, he kept pushing for that. like, after the lawyer was doing so much writing up of this contract, I was starting to get worried about, I don't want to get into endless legal battles with these people.  was already getting scared about because they were drafting up red tape, red, redlining the contract so much. And he said, in the way the tone of his lawyer was, I didn't even like the tone of his lawyer.  that I was thinking, I don't wanna get to think where I'm in this law case and I'm footing the bill for all, for everything here.  So that even put me off and I asked Justin about that and I was like, Are you like dead sound on this indemnification thing?  and he's like, I mean, get it. We discussed it, so I want it, you know? But honestly, I'm like, why did you make that such a big deal?  It was just literally just the fees. Who would pay the lawyer fees? And they made a big deal out of that.  It's like, if you want this business, why did you let that cost friction in your negotiation, right? Because that, the purchase agreement that was sent, now that I'm listening to him, I mean, if I really want that business, I think I could have made that happen.  So I think Justin would be a bit stubborn and he wanted just the absolute perfect deal exactly how he wanted it up.
  ACTION ITEM: Call Justin. Give feedback on failed deal (no in-person meeting, ghosting, etc). Discuss salvage strategy (golf invite, business visit). - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/239844102?timestamp=3899.9999  And that caused him from. Then I get the deal done.

1:05:07 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Have you given all this feedback to Justin?

1:05:10 - AcquiMatch Team
  No, I just had the call this afternoon.

1:05:12 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  But just okay. What are you thinking the play is from here? I have thoughts, but I want to hear your thoughts first.  So I'm not just telling you what to do.

1:05:26 - AcquiMatch Team
  didn't even think about it because I was going to tell if you know everything and see what she says.  So what's your gut telling you? My gut is telling me I'm going to tell Justin. He's lost a bit of trust based off the back and forth.  I try to bring him to the table. The only thing that's going to bring this guy back is if you personally reach out and you make this a personal thing between you two without the lawyers involved.  There's nothing else. like we're beyond that like he's ready to walk away and sell to one of his guys You got to a purchase agreement, which you got really close Are these deal killers for you or like these little things deal killers?

1:06:15 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  If not your last chance I think it's just to reach on a personal level and try to win its confidence if you really want this deal That's what you got to do Yeah, I would Similar to what you're saying I would Tell Justin like hey, I've got some tough feedback for you But I want to be honest with you because I think If you can try a different tactic and Listen to us and use our guidance and maybe talk some of these things through before you Go after this guy we can help you get this  over the line, right? you also add that to the feedback, like me and Athena both have been trying our hardest to get you to talk to us about what's going on in your strategy.  You've not been talking to us, you're using a lawyer that doesn't have, like we don't know them, so we don't know their tactics and whether what they're asking for is like reasonable or not.  you're not a anymore, but we, you know, put this in front of you because we wanted to help you get it closed.  So it's not, you've never been through this before, you've got an off-market deal, you do not know everything and actually you also have challenges, like where you'll put up so many blocks from moving something forward because you get scared, you know, like in your own words, but this is what he does.  Like he went down the rabbit hole of looking at  every single looking for review sites on business. businesses. And we lost multiple businesses because he would do that because he was just scared, you know, and then it was like, after I called him out on that, then he started sending out Alawais.  But it's like, dude, there is no honor in you doing this by yourself when you've never done this before.  And also, what the  you've never gone and met him in person, like that is like, send number one of trying to buy someone's business.  Like, so you got some repairing to do if you, but like, my question is like, do you genuinely want this business?  If you do, then we need to talk about how you fix this, you know? So like, that would be my first question to him is like, you're doing that thing again, where you're putting up all these barriers and you're fighting about things that are unreasonable to the point where you're losing it.  Is this a self sabotage thing or do you genuinely want it? are you sabotaging it because you don't want it?  So it's like, let's put everything in place because it's not our deal that we actually want. Or did you actually want it?  And you were scared and you  went bad because you were scared and trying to cover yourself every which way from Sunday.  So there's like one or two things happening. One, he didn't really want it that bad, which is why all these things went in place or two.  He really did want it that bad, but he didn't want to buy it badly. So he was trying to cover all of his tracks and you know, not actually use all the resources around him, which is  weird, right?  Like you have us like, we're not charging you. the  dude? Why aren't you talking to us? would call about on that.

1:09:35 - AcquiMatch Team
  Yeah.

1:09:38 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So that would mean, oh, sorry, go ahead. I have a follow on from that, but that would be the first part that I would do.

1:09:45 - AcquiMatch Team
  were you going to say the other thing what? So the thing about that makes me question about how much you wanted it is that when the purchase agreement was sent.  And they made three adjustments to the AP that Justin wasn't happy about. Justin never responded to the email. So he received an email with a purchase agreement and he just didn't respond.  didn't call. He didn't email. He didn't say, I'm happy with these terms. He just ghosted it. And so when I talked to him and I said, I talked to Justin, it's obvious he still wants to get a deal done, you guys couldn't, sounds like you guys couldn't reach an agreement on some just a few terms and I wanted to discuss those with you.  He goes, that's ironic because since I sent purchase agreement, I haven't heard one word from Justin. And I was like, what?  I was like, he didn't even email or he just literally got the purchase agreement and just didn't respond. Said nothing.

1:11:05 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  This is like, sorry, this is just like a personal rant, but like, this is what  irritates me so much when people are like, how many businesses have your clients closed?  was like, well, in our original model, we didn't have any sort of like oversight or handed it, right? And this is what's happened.  This is what happens when people are left in their own  devices, to do this. Um, what the ? And on top of all that, like, we brought it to him on a silver platter knowing we could have gotten money elsewhere and actually gotten deal done because we wanted to like, help him out.  Okay. But we still feel good. We did the right thing in that regard. So the right thing now would be to give Justin honest feedback, like, hey, dude, you went wrong in a couple of different areas, right?  so my question is like, do You genuinely actually even want this business or not, because if you do, we have some cleaning up to do and there's no guarantee that you're going to get it, but here's what you need to do going forward.  If you want it, if you don't want it, then I think we need to wrap up that conversation with the seller regardless, right?  Because we went on all in here, we brought you something like that's a relationship that we had. It's not really putting us in the best now.  So do you genuinely want it? Do you want to fight for it? If so, let's talk how that looks like.  So that's point one. got some not great feedback for you. I want to share it. It's a learning opportunity.  There might be a way to salvage it, but first, do you want this business or not? Do you even want it?  In any case, if you want to buy a business, I think you need to hear this feedback now.

1:12:56 - AcquiMatch Team
  Okay.

1:12:58 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  And then if he wants it, then I would say it's not only a personal reach out, it's a hey, I talked to Ryan.  I realized I didn't handle some of these things well. I'm a first time by myself. Let's go off for golf, like whether we end up finishing this deal or not.  want to take you out for around a golf and like at least, you know, like acknowledge the time and energy that you put into this, right?  So it's like removing the pressure of like getting a deal done, go out for golf, get to know the guy.  If nothing else, then, you know, he just gets to have around a golf and a learning experience and maybe the seller will open up and be like, I didn't like these things and, you know, if you're to do this in the future, whatever.  Or the seller's like, you know what, I really like Justin. I love that he's, you know, a young family, his intentions are in the right place.  Let's talk about actually getting this done. But if he acknowledges that, like, he didn't handle it very well, then the all of branch of, like, hey, I'm, I'm sorry, I screwed this up.  This is my first time doing it. heard everything that Ryan said, let me take you out to around a golf, no pressure, you know, whether this, whether we continue with this or not, let's go out to around the golf.  I want to get to know ya, you know, and then if the golf goes well and the owner is open to having a conversation, then Justin needs to go and visit that business and actually see what he's buying.  Like, what the  are you doing? Getting a term sheet and putting together an APA before you've even been there.  What are you doing? And the other thing I would say is like, Justin, if you really want this business, we are getting on a weekly call and you are going to tell me what's going on and you are going to run these.  decisions passed me before  doing it. our reputation is on the line now. So like, you know, I'm here to help.  You need to use us. We're a resource. You've never done this before. You also got bad information from, you know, a business buying community that's now every broke brokers black listed anybody that belongs to that community.  So let us help you. So that's how I play it. And I get on a call. get a get a gauge on whether he actually wants it or not see if he's open shift feedback.  And then if he wants to leave the relationship in a good place one way or another, take him out for golf.  If the golf goes well, go visit the business, set up a weekly call with you so he can like  make sure that he's not being unreasonable and his requests are the things that he's doing.  So he doesn't cost himself the deal, which it sounds like he has already, but there might be a way to get it back on.

1:16:00 - AcquiMatch Team
  Yep, we'll try.

1:16:03 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  And he can make one of the guys or owner or do some rollover equity to him or something, right?  So it's like, go and hear that seller out. When you go to ask him what he wants, get to understand him.  What are his motivations? What are his guys like, how important are they to him? And, you know, like, well, hey, I want to take care of him too.  I want, I want your guys to. You know, we looked after, do you think that they have the ability to run a business?  I don't know if this guy's going to have confidence in him at this point.

1:16:38 - AcquiMatch Team
  As we were going, was like, my hope was to bring him back and like all these things he's saying.  was like, Oh, I was just like. Yep.

1:16:53 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  No, you don't know I felt with Eli. It's heartbreak. Isn't it like when you do all that work to give rap something and put it in front of them and then they just blow it up Yeah, and blame the seller It doesn't show that I mean I will say like I when it ended it was there was like a lot of it.

1:17:16 - AcquiMatch Team
  It was just like I felt that if I was involved that that wouldn't have happened and that just makes me feel good about what we do I was like This isn't even like I mean that is that deal with a layup Right and so I just realizing it doesn't matter if we handsome perfect deal if they can't get it done Like there's so many things in this process That this service is absolutely needed, you know Yeah Um Luke and david, I know you've been listening for a while, but did you track?

1:17:53 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Did you follow all that? That's a big learning for all of us, right?

1:17:59 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah, I mean I've just had my eyebrows raise this whole conversation that's you don't even need to be in the space like us to not do what Justin is doing.  It's he's doing everything to us as our generation would say fumble this deal like he's fumbling is his horror one.  It's just I think it's just a whole lot of pride and ego involved. He's he's gonna if he wants to get this deal back alive, this is like this is the scene in the movie where like the guy  up and he's standing outside in the rain.  Like throwing rocks the window like like Justin doesn't just yeah yeah Justin doesn't just need to swallow it right he needs to chug his pride like he has a whole bottle to chug it to yeah he's brutally  things up.

1:18:47 - David R
  What do you think David I think it's really nice to see how you guys approach these deep niches you know because so hard you know after all this work.  And I just messed up something and they don't say anything about that. yeah, I just think it's really good to know in the future, you know, how you guys solve these issues and how you guys approach these different situations.  If something comes up similar to this in the future, but yeah, it's just, it's just amazing.

1:19:25 - Luke Gillespie
  And like David, what Ryan's saying about how this proves the value that we offer, this is like when you're telling your friends or family what you do for work, what our business does, this is one of the things you can explain, right?  This deal would have never gone to hell like this if we were working with Justin, right? It's only because Justin tried to do this on his own, but he's just, like, I know it's like your second week or whatever, but if you've been here as long as you understand, you'd be like hitting yourself, how much Justin ruined this and how rare and how valuable an off market opportunity is, especially getting all the way to purchase agreements.

1:20:00 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, this type of business to you and like, Ryan was like, Athena, I would buy this like, I think he wanted to.  So when he found it, so David just from some background in context, JQ, Justin was our very first client.  So none of us would be here if Justin hadn't given me a chance, you know, because he knew I'd never done this for anyone else before.  So like Justin gave me a chance. We had issues with him early on because he gets scared and he does weird things when he gets scared.  And everybody, and you know, the more we talk about clients, you'll hear this. All the clients do weird things when they get scared.  They all do different things when they get scared. So, you know, Justin sounds like he's hiding behind the lawyer and the computer and whatever because it's like, it's a big deal to put your family's livelihood on the line and buy a business and put a personal guarantee and potentially, you know, lose your  house and everything as a result of that. So, Justin, in our original service, we only gave people deals. We didn't help them with what came next.  were only like, here's a deal, here's a deal, here's a deal, you go. And it was watching how much they were struggling, actually getting a deal done.  That's when we changed the model last summer. And we changed it to like, no, it's actually a success fee model.  And we're going to stay with you through to close because we were watching people just destroy these opportunities on their own.  Because it's the first time they've been through it. It's like, oh, here's a house, you know, like, now off you go and buy it.  No broker, anybody in the middle of it, like, you get to talk to the owner and figure out how going to buy that house now.  um, so we see it through to the end now because of watching. things like this. Ryan ended up finding this lead in Justin's, like it was from Justin's original search.  It just came up after he'd ended services with us because he went under offer on something else. And I'm guessing some of these similar issues are the reason why that deal is no longer going forward.  But we found this opportunity and Ryan and I were like, okay, we could potentially take it to someone else and make some money off of it.  We could tell Justin that we have it and he needs to pay us a success fee or because he was our original client and it's the reason why we have this business.  Let's just bring this to him and be like, hey, we know you never actually closed on the other business.  We have this other one. Do you like it? And then he loved it and started, you know, running straight towards an asset purchase agreement instead of an LOI, which was confusing and had this lawyer that none of us knew, but he loves and insists that this guy does these kinds of deals all the  day long. And yeah, it was just, it was, we kept asking, I'm like, what's going on? Do you need help?  Can we talk to you about anything? And he just wasn't really giving us much about what was going on.  So then, you know, the, the, we're all excited because we get a note from the lender that like commitment letter came through to buy the business.  And we're like, yeah, my God, Justin's gonna close. And then like, you know, Ryan and Anka and I are sharing it.  And Ryan's like, I just got a letter, I got an email from the seller saying he wants to find other buyers.  He's not happy with Justin. And we're like, what the ? Like, so, um, so this isn't an example of how it normally goes with clients.  Like we wouldn't have just handed it off and left them to their own devices, especially with off market. Ryan's a lot more involved in the initial conversations.  He makes introductions. know, there's like weekly calls that we have and that sort of thing. So we're learning through these opportunities also, but it's  It's because of this reason why we no longer just bring people deals and set them free. And one of the things that just greats me on the sales calls is when people are like, how many businesses have you closed?  I was like, well, that would have been five by now if people hadn't have like destroyed their deals that we brought them, you know?

1:24:24 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah, Ryan, is there a chance to recycle this deal for Gil?

1:24:28 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Isn't it in New York, New Jersey or something? Oh God, I would, I don't know, like after this experience with this other, like whoever we put in front of him needs to be a wonderful relationship building, warm, know, like a ronaut that will spend months getting to know him, building that relationship, going on with him and like that sort of thing.  as much as I adore Gil, that is not, we need to upskill him. area on how to do that.

1:25:02 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah, I mean, IT guys, not as strong as it is.

1:25:06 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  That's certainly IT guy. I just don't think he's as comfortable, like, we're not on that. It's just like second nature on how to build a relationship with somebody like that in a sales scenario, right?  And, and, you know, doesn't have as much experience. He's got a lot of experience in his career with operational stuff.  He has a great, like, part he care about culture, that sort of thing. But I think it's that initial relationship building from a sales aspect that's not necessarily a skill he's had a lot of experience with, which is why we have to have Ryan involved in these conversations to like bring them.  But since the sellers now had not experienced with one of our buyers, like, and he doesn't even want to entertain another buyer, he wants to sell it to his guy.  If we were to bring another buyer in front of him, it would need to be someone probably like an Andrew, you know?

1:25:58 - Luke Gillespie
  True. Yeah. Yeah, well, Ryan, I hope you can work some magic on this one.

1:26:05 - AcquiMatch Team
  Yeah, well, we'll what happens. But either way, it's a learning experience. And, you know, we're making a lot of progress with these off markets.  So it's all, all these things that just like the same thing with your writeups, each one, just back, okay, right, and just take all that and then use that on the next opportunity.

1:26:31 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Also, Justin gets an opportunity to hear feedback that he might not have gotten elsewhere, you know, so people keep thinking deals are dying for like reasons that they're not.  And it's like, no, dude, you haven't even been to meet the guy in person. Like, what is going on with that?  Like, it's a landscaping business. Like, this is the physical business. You need to go and meet the guy.

1:26:53 - Luke Gillespie
  What happened? You said you were going to go golfing with them. Why didn't you?

1:27:00 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  I had to build the relationship, you can't just go in APA style and never haven't meet the day, like, you know, even Lindsay and Kevin, like when they had negotiations on their deal, they drove all the way down to San Antonio, it's an hour and a half away to have these discussions with the sellers.  So anyways, okay, we're running super late, thanks for staying on, always love these discussions where we're learning and extracting knowledge and talking about strategy and stuff, y'all feel good.

1:27:30 - Luke Gillespie
  Yep, things are going on.

1:27:32 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Cool, well, good luck with the end of month push. This is the shortest month we will have this year, so most pressure will have this year in a month until we start getting more clients, so shortest month will have, that's all I'll say, not least not most pressure, just shortest month, so yeah, every other month will have a few more days, so hmm nice, awesome, have a good rest of your day, we'll see you guys on Thursday. Oh, Ryan on Thursday, Nash can't actually join until like 15 minutes later.  So I didn't want to tell. Like, I just want to keep them on the schedule that they turn out at the same time every day.  So if there's anyone's deals or any live things that like would be good for a little fit in a discussion before we bring Nash on, give me a heads up and then we can talk about some stuff before while we wait for him to join.

1:28:27 - AcquiMatch Team
  Okay, got it.

1:28:29 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Cool. Thanks y'all. Have a great rest of your day.

1:28:32 - Luke Gillespie
  You do.

1:28:32 - David R
  Thank you. You too.

1:28:33 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Bye.
