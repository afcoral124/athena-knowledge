[01:46]
Athena Simpson: Okay. The Players Club today is going to be with Mathias and Valerie from Pioneer Capital.

[01:53]
Austin Lortie: Oh, nice. Yeah, yeah.

[01:55]
Athena Simpson: So it might be worth you getting the latest on the SOP guidelines for SBA.

[02:00]
Austin Lortie: Mm-hmm.

[02:00]
Athena Simpson: All right.

[02:00]
Austin Lortie: Okay.

[02:00]
Athena Simpson: That's directly after our call.

[02:02]
Austin Lortie: Cool. Yeah. I'd love to participate in that. If anything, I'll just like pop in on my phone as I'm like getting ready if I have to like pop up like maybe 30 minutes in.

[02:12]
Athena Simpson: Yeah. Cool. Let me add you to that now. And then if you do end up moving around, just turn your camera off for me.

[02:22]
Austin Lortie: Absolutely. We'll make sure we're professional. By the way.

[02:25]
Athena Simpson: Well, I mean, it's funny you assume that, but like, think like, you know, some of the team has thought like, I don't want her to think I'm not here and paying attention. So, yeah. So they'll be moving around and stuff. I'm like, if you're going to be moving, turn off your camera. Cool.

[02:42]
Austin Lortie: One thing before I dive in.

[02:44]
Athena Simpson: Yeah.

[02:44]
Austin Lortie: It's like a question about, did you see like SMS sales channel? And I just haven't responded to this yet. Cause I'm like, I've been slow to respond anyways. And just wanted your feedback on this. But he was asking about pricing structure. So I was just going to tell him it's milestone based to like, give him an answer to his question. And then he asked about virtual agents, and I was going to tell him that, like, we're a remote company, but don't leverage VAs. So I don't know if those are things you're comfortable with me saying. The VA portion was, like, the main, like, question that I had, because it came up on my call with Devin today, too. I wouldn't answer any of this stuff on text message. Okay.

[03:25]
Athena Simpson: You know, or I'd be, like, asking why, right? Because he's objecting before he even knows what we do.

[03:33]
Austin Lortie: I wouldn't take that as an objection, though. I think, like, that's, like, more of just, like, a general inquiry.

[03:40]
Athena Simpson: Like, what even is a virtual agent?

[03:44]
Austin Lortie: Like, uh, I'm sure he's talking about, like, offshore VAs, which is a thought process there.

[03:50]
Athena Simpson: I would confirm what he means by a virtual agent.

[03:54]
Austin Lortie: Yeah. Cool. Uh, so I, if, if I got that, I'd be, like, uh.

[04:00]
Athena Simpson: But two months is just getting started. SMBash a couple weeks ago said, you know, if you're doing this on your own, three to four years. So patience is definitely needed. We're a bespoke service. So it will depend on your search. We can talk about, you know, like, I need to get a better understanding of where you're at. Yeah.

[04:23]
Austin Lortie: Like, but we are milestone based.

[04:25]
Athena Simpson: And then what do you mean by virtual agents?

[04:30]
Austin Lortie: Cool. Yeah. My thought was like, I'm usually like, we'll try and answer in as like simple a form as possible and like push to a conversation, but like, not just like ignore a blatant question that they asked us, you know? Yeah, cool. That's helpful. I'll shoot that out right after we'll hear in just a second. What do you want to cover on our call today, Athena?

[04:50]
Athena Simpson: Yeah, so I read your review of Devon. So how do you, so it's good. To just kind of hear it verbally.

[05:01]
Austin Lortie: Yeah, it's easier to talk through than read through. It was pretty good. I think I did a better job of actually lowering her defenses and getting her to be real with me very, very quickly on that call. And I was like, hey, sorry about yesterday. If I was stumbling over my words, I'm not new to M&A or capital markets, but I'm getting ramped up with Athena, so I appreciate your patience. And she's like, oh no, you were fine. I would have never known. She's like, I kind of thought that because Athena was on the call and didn't say much. She was like, but it wasn't due to anything you said or anything like that. So I just had kind of an honest moment with her and dug into, obviously, Agenda, confirmed that we were recording the call, asked her about watching the video, and then like dove into some of, or like provided feedback, which really resonated with her. The one thing that she added was like, hey. Austin, like, just so you know, I am open to lower SDE engagements, provided that there's already an operator in place. And she's like, so should we move forward? That's something that I want to discuss with her team, right? And then dug into her thought process around remote, and she was like, I was like, hey, like, doing this remotely can, like, definitely present challenges, like, especially at the SDE ranges that you're looking at. Like, you've got to understand, like, you're in direct competition with, like, large strategics, as well as private equity at that level. And so I was like, hey, talk to me a little bit about, like, are you open to e-com or other remote businesses? And she said, like, similar to what she was saying yesterday, in the sense of like, hey, like, I'm a bit concerned about product based businesses with tariffs, XYZ. And then we started talking about, like, brick and mortar locations that could be pivoted to a remote model. And I used the example that you gave me this morning with the... The media agency out of San Antonio, and she was like, yeah, I've actually looked at opportunities like that. And I was like, okay, well, talk to me about under what circumstances and how, like, would it make sense for you to, like, actually, like, be in person somewhere. And she was like, let me put it to you this way, Austin. And, like, if we found the right engagement, I would fly there and live there for six months in an Airbnb if I had to, like, make sure that, like, I could learn and understand that business during that transitionary period. she was like, but the thing I'm going to be focused on is finding somebody or someone with, like, an operator or some level of infrastructure in place where, like, if I leave after that initial six-months tranche, like, someone's there to support the organization in my absence. So, like, hit and miss. And, like, the call didn't go overly well anyway. It's, like, you hit the nail on the head. was, like, she's, like, very database. And, like, the objections that I got were, like, hey, well, has Athena done a transaction? And I was, like, what do you mean? Has Athena done a transaction? I'm like, we've done multiple on behalf of our clients, you know, it's like the gist of like the response that I gave her. It's like, well, no, like, like she was talking about like trying to acquire a business initially. And I was like, yeah, like in built a strong network as a result. And there's really gone all in on AcquiMatch and supporting first time business buyers like yourself in, in helping like reach that next to that next phase and actually realize business ownership in their dreams, essentially. Has Chelsea bought a business? Uh, I don't think so. I don't think so. Um, yeah. And I didn't know that. I didn't know the answer to that question, but I was just, I hit on the.

[08:41]
Athena Simpson: Well, here, here, here's the thing, right? Like, um, does she judge brokers on whether they have bought a business?

[08:51]
Austin Lortie: That's exactly what I told her. was like, hey, like most intermediaries like haven't bought a business. And she was like, well, the reason that I chose to move forward with Walker was because. Because he has a strong history of succeeding in this space. And I was like, I 100% get that. But Walker's not the one running your coaching calls typically within that organization, correct? Right? So it was her own thing. And I think it was more of a lack of data question that came out as a personal attack when it didn't need to be. So I tried to...

[09:23]
Athena Simpson: Yeah. And here's my thoughts on that, right? So... She's not going to buy a business. She's looked at 200 Sims and she hasn't had a conversation. And now she's making decisions based on whether somebody that runs a business that finds businesses has bought a business themselves.

[09:46]
Austin Lortie: Yeah.

[09:47]
Athena Simpson: You know? So it's like, do you want me to be distracted, like acquiring businesses and doing all those things? Or do you want me to be 100% personally guaranteed in a business where I'm obsessed with how we find businesses? And then the operator... In addition to that is a huge red flag for me. Either she's terrified of her ability to run a business or she's not prepared for what business ownership is like. So if somebody is looking for guarantees for success and using unrelated or uncorrelated data points to make decisions, she's going to be one of those analysis paralysis people. And she's already done that. So I find that our best clients are the ones that know and acknowledge that they are the ones that have to do the work, that their success is not dependent on our acquisition experience. And as long as we give them enough reps so that what they're looking to do is get more reps and then have someone that like calls.

[11:00]
Austin Lortie: them out when they're getting in their way.

[11:02]
Athena Simpson: And I'm kind of in the place now, Austin, where it's like, I don't need to, she's got testimonials on the website of people with her exact background that have bought businesses that fit her profile. Um, so if she needs the person running a search and match service to have acquired businesses.

[11:29]
Austin Lortie: Yeah, I thought that was a weird request to you. Um, but one thing that I did come out of that, you know, is like, I struggled to tell your actual, yeah, your initial story. And like, one of the things that I think about is like, in like, we can solve this one of two ways, like you and I can do a deeper dive into like, the specifics of that. So like, if somebody is like, what kind of business was it? Like, what other offers were there? What specifically could she have done? Make that better that I can speak to that a little bit better. But I was like, oh, . Like, it was like I had like probably the oh,  look on my face that she brought that up because I'm like, I don't know the answer to that question.

[12:11]
Athena Simpson: Yeah, you're right. Right. And this is what we found when I handed over broker calls to Brian.

[12:20]
Austin Lortie: Right.

[12:21]
Athena Simpson: I was doing the broker calls myself. And the way that I was I was able to get their buy in was saying that I was also an investor and a buyer.

[12:30]
Austin Lortie: And I had to start that way.

[12:32]
Athena Simpson: But when like if I've grown the business to the point that I'm not doing the sales calls, that in itself is credibility of where we're at. You know what I mean? So it's almost like we have to we don't need the origin story of me. When you're showing a slide of like eight people working on their search for them.

[12:54]
Austin Lortie: That's what I think in like going through like each individual and their role within the companies. seemed to land pretty well with her. And that was another thing she brought up was leveraging offshore talent. I'm like, look, the people that are actually evaluating the opportunities on your behalf have deep expertise in investment banking. I'm like, yeah, we use offshore resources in terms of lead generation and things of that nature. But the people that are actually delivering on the service on the coaching calls with you are all stateside. How did she know they were offshore? I have no idea. I didn't bring it up. She was just like, they're probably offshore, right? And I was like, no, not really. You know, I think had to do with like Masam and then Ida's name. Ida and Anka's name specifically. It might have been something that I said, but I didn't say anything regarding like offshore talent or like offshore team or anything.

[13:51]
Athena Simpson: Anka does an MBA.

[13:53]
Austin Lortie: Oh, that's tight. That's good to know.

[13:57]
Athena Simpson: Okay, here's another thing. Tell me you don't know how to run a small business without telling me, and a tech company at that. Like, somebody at Anka's level would cost... Anka's freaking a gangster. I tell her that I don't know what I talk to her. But like, her salary, the salaries in South Africa, like 25% or less of what I would have to pay here for somebody of Anka's caliber ability and skill set.

[14:27]
Austin Lortie: She's freaking... I'm like, Anka's so good at her job. I tell her that. I tell her that today.

[14:32]
Athena Simpson: I'm like, every time I hop on with you, Anka, like, I'm just so impressed. David, too. He's like, , like, growth hacker in startups, like, huge growth. And the value that he's brought already in his two months, like, he's changing our whole database system. He's like, he's so good, right? And then Masam has an... Entire team behind them. So I got an entire team for paying $5 an hour for sourcing leads and sorting the tens of thousands of businesses that come through. So it's like you want to run a remote company and you're judging me for getting top tier talent and being able to employ eight people when I only have 10 clients. Like, again, it's that disconnect between where she's come from and where she's going. And I'm willing to go smaller in SDE as long as there's an operator in place is literally like a non-existent thing.

[15:39]
Austin Lortie: Right. You're like the smaller in SDE, the more likely is the owner's heavily involved.

[15:44]
Athena Simpson: Exactly. So, you know, I'm getting a little bit like because you're now experiencing my frustration is that people don't have enough education or understanding. So they make these assumptions and judgments of us. And I'm kind of. I live at the point where I predict we are going to be drowning when Lindsay and Kevin's podcast drops. And then we're in the position of, look, you came to us. You found us. Like, I don't have to pay for marketing. I don't have to put myself out there. And I know Walker and Chelsea's business model is being martyrs and talking about how they don't make any money. Like, they both, Chelsea told me, like, both of them, last time I met them at M&A Launchpad, were telling me they don't make any money off of this. And I was like, so, okay, maybe you successfully bought businesses, but you're running a unprofitable business? Like, and destroying yourselves for it?

[16:46]
Austin Lortie: That's not, martyrdom's not cute. Like, the, I'm like, I didn't, like, Chelsea's okay. That's who I sat down and had dinner with the night before of that event initially. And I was just like, I got, like, a really pretentious vibe from her where, like, she's not very humble and, like, every, like, Walker, like, I had better vibes from than, like, I met one of their sales guys with that Acquisition Labs as well, like, bought the manufacturing company in New Jersey and then immediately fired everyone on day one. I'm like, like, I just didn't have great, like, engagements with, like, anyone on their team outside of Walker. At that event. But that was me personally.

[17:32]
Athena Simpson: Yeah. think instead of being collaborative and supportive of the community, they're out there on an island complaining about everybody else and then, like, talking about how much they're not making any money and how hard it is for them. And, like, to complete strangers, it could potentially be competition, right? Like, it's weird. Like, I was like, why the  are you telling me you don't know who I am or what I do and you're telling me you don't make any money off of this business? That you charge people. Well, eight to ten thousand dollars to join. Like, are you running a charity? And you're telling other people to buy? You're giving business advice when you're not running your business profitably? Like, that is interesting. And, like, I like them because they try, they're at least talking about the reality of things and that sort of thing. But it's this very, like, us against them feeling about them. So, anyways, with, yeah, but I mean, it's, it's, I was a facilitator in Cody Sanchez's community. I helped thousands of people in that community with their transactions. Before that, I ran the world's largest food tech community where I supported thousands of startups from starting through to exiting. And I had, like, you know, clients like PepsiCo and Nestle and Tyson and the British government and the Swedish government.

[18:59]
Austin Lortie: So I have been.

[19:00]
Athena Simpson: I've been in transactions forever. I've taught entrepreneurship at one of the top business schools in the country.

[19:07]
Austin Lortie: So if she needs to  know that I bought a business, she's never gonna buy a business, right? I thought that was a weird request too. And then just like strong, the last one was just like strong objection and overpricing. And like, this is how I approached it, right? And like, I genuinely do genuinely like am interested in what she has to say about it. She was like, well, you seem to be in line with the brokers that I've talked to. And I was like, like, it was just frustrating for me too, Athena, because it's like, I'm usually good at being able to like, ask questions multiple times in multiple ways and get somebody to like actually express an answer to me. But like, I asked her to rate like her interest on a scale from one to 10, like, probably like four or five times. And she just like refused to engage in that. And then like, same thing, right? It's like I was talking about my, okay. Well, sounds like you've evaluated other vendors. What specifically can a broker offer that we can't? Because I was like, I'm new. It's probably me just doing a bad job of explaining what it is that we do here. Just trying to fall on the sword and see if she was willing to give additional information that way. just like, nothing, nothing, nothing. I'm like, buy-side buyers that I know, their upfront fee is somewhere between $20,000 to $50,000. And then they're going to take 5% to 10% on the back end. Is that similar to what you've seen? Yeah. Okay. So what can a broker do that I can't? I was like, I'll tell you two things. One, I can't submit an LOI. I'll help you craft the offer, the structure of it, everything that you possibly need. But in terms of like actually submitting that to the sell-side agent, I can't do it. I like, the second thing, I can't actually gather due diligence details for you. I'm like, that's something that you're going to want to do on your own anyway. I'm going to provide you a list of everything that you could. Possibly want to know about the due diligence process, but I can't gather that information for you. I'm like, those are the only two things that a broker can do and how you'll be supported that I can't do here. So is that not worth $100,000 to you? It was kind of the approach that I took to that objection. So I don't know how you feel about that response to me.

[21:24]
Athena Simpson: The broker, so another thing brokers will do is they'll negotiate on behalf of the buyer, which we don't do. So we won't do the direct conversations, but we'll coach them behind the scenes. But yeah, I think you're going to see this a lot with people that there's a lot of people, especially from corporate, that need 100% guarantee of success to move forward. And they're just never going to get that right. And then this gives me Jason vibes again. Like just giving you nothing, not working with you. Also the thing that you need to look at through this process is like, is this person coachable?

[22:06]
Austin Lortie: Are they humble enough to acknowledge that they don't know what they don't know? I think our call with Morgan tomorrow is going to go a lot better than that one did.

[22:15]
Athena Simpson: He sold himself to us like five times during that call. And he heard me. So in the lecture that I gave, I talked about all the  I went through with this business and how it started. And like, he knows like more than any other person that comes to us. And I, and like how I built the team and the clients that I had. And like, he knows how many clients he knows. Like when I hit my first hundred K with this business, like I was not going into that lecture thinking I'm going to get a client out of this. And like, let me tell them how I built this business. Right. It started with a PDF deck and $10,000 a month recurring revenue from my first two clients.

[22:59]
Austin Lortie: So, you know, and.

[23:00]
Athena Simpson: It was a no-brainer yes for them because they watched me run my own search and do everything that I did and bring them deals that they missed to themselves. Then I was like, well, sign a non-circumvention. Here's this deal. And they're like, oh, I looked at this one and I passed. I'm like, yeah. So there's just going to be people that if they don't see the value, they're going to be terrible clients.

[23:28]
Austin Lortie: Yeah. But I'm like, I'm not even mad about it because it's helpful for me to get reps in as well and figure out what I'm doing on my side. But the win, I would say, from that call was the ability to break down barriers, level with her a little bit, and get her to actually open up and have a real conversation about who she was, at least initially in that call, until the point where we got to pricing and then she naturally closed off a little bit and was like, okay, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Right. And like, like, that's going to happen whether, like, with a lot of people, even if they are qualified to work with us, I would guess. So like, it's helpful to be like, just exposed to those objections and just like, maybe like talk through like we are right now, like, how I could have handled them better, or if like, what I'm saying is actually accurate, or if I'm pulling that out of my butt, you know. Yeah.

[24:24]
Athena Simpson: And also like, to discern who's going to be a good client, who's going to be a nightmare client for us. So yeah, like, I don't, I don't think she'll be, she maybe needs to go and get beat up for another six, 12 months searching. And then they come back and they're like, I understand the value now, you know, she's like, she started in January. But I don't know, like the, the, when they're like, I know it all, prove it to me. I'm like, you came to me for help, you know, like, no, like, I don't. I don't, I don't need to drag you through this process the whole time. And then, and then it's really tough on the team to throughout the delivery.

[25:07]
Austin Lortie: I went and looked at her resume and I'm like, not overly impressed. I'm like, you stayed at one company forever. And then I came up through their marketing team to like, get to a VP level, which like, don't get me wrong. Like, that's impressive. But like, you've had one job throughout your entire career and like, haven't been exposed to like, other organizations or like the complexity and like, differences between like, how different like leaders manage things differently and like having to adapt to that or having to like, manage different product lines and things of that nature where like, her resume is just like, not crazy. And like, how they, they, they had like, I think she had equity in that company for being there for 20 years. And then that's where her cash came from was like a liquidity event to like a large strategic and then she was able to like cash out those shares. So that's like where all the capital came from. It's not like she went out and like, like, don't get me wrong, that's still self made, right? You've got to pick the right lottery ticket in order to realize like, gains when it comes to an acquisition, you know, like, to me, I'm just like, that's, that's overly impressive to me.

[26:18]
Athena Simpson: No, and you have to take a lot of risk to be a business owner, you know, so like staying with the same company for 20 years, it's literally the definition of playing it safe.

[26:28]
Austin Lortie: Yeah.

[26:30]
Athena Simpson: So, but someone in the military, like, especially if he was active duty at any point, like, that's somebody that knows what to do when   starts hitting the fan, you know, he's not gonna crumble. And he's humble, and he cares, and he has heart. And he's, he's open to the fact that like, he's willing to take action and do the hard work, but also open to the fact that he doesn't know everything, and will do things faster. If he hires someone, that's really, I know, as a business. a business owner, right? Like, I could I could try. mean, at one point I had to learn the sales myself because it's like, well, how can I translate this to somebody else? And as the founder, your chief revenue officer, right? It's my job to make sure the revenue is coming in. But like, is it my job to like the database is getting overloaded? Is it my job to figure that out myself and do the implementation and the transfer? Like, not a good use of my time. I need a spreadsheet that does certain things. I know what the outcome is. Do I need to learn all the formulas myself? And like, you know, so it's just like, that is telling me like, you're, you want somebody else to do all the work. But you judge people to standards that are not that of sort of like a small business and like the right judgment calls of what to outsource versus. So you're telling me you want somebody else to run your business. But you're not trusting somebody. That's put a personal guarantee and all of their time and energy into building a business that sources businesses for people who's a five-time founder. You want her to have bought a business?

[28:14]
Austin Lortie: Well, I'm going to use that for future calls too, Athena, because it's really like, so you're telling me you want to go and integrate an operator, have them responsible for running that business while you're more or less absentee and you're taking out seven figures on debt on that, but you're concerned about a 70K payment to us? Make that make sense for me.

[28:42]
Athena Simpson: Not only that, but you're going to put a personal guarantee, your entire livelihood and all of your assets on the line, and you're happy to hand that off to somebody else that you don't even know yet. But like working with a business where the founder For themselves, has a personal guarantee on that business, like, and she's in it, and she's working it. You would rather her be out there buying businesses and not paying attention to this.

[29:11]
Austin Lortie: That would make you feel better. That's a good point, yeah. I could have probably dug into that a little bit, a little more, but on a sheer point, it sounds like not a great fit client.

[29:22]
Athena Simpson: Exactly, and there's a point when it's just like, just let it go. Like, with Aravond yesterday, was like, he wants help with the financing. Like, I'm not, I am not, like, he's like, I don't need help with deal sourcing. It's like, then we're not a good fit. You know, you're already talking to main shares. They're probably your best bet right now, but, like, honestly, our bread and butter is deal sourcing. Um, so, like, that's, that's how I feel with him, because it's like, we help clients problem solve on the financing part. But what I was trying to convey to him in the. Chat is like, that's not a service that we offer. It's not like a consultancy thing. We don't help people raise money or find financing. We help people find businesses and then troubleshoot and get it over the line. So if you don't need help with deal sourcing, then we're probably not a great, like it's not worth your time to talk to us.

[30:21]
Austin Lortie: Right.

[30:23]
Athena Simpson: So you could probably have that conversation with him this weekend.

[30:27]
Austin Lortie: Yeah, I will. I'm like, I will 100%. I'm like, he liked my message. was just like, the biggest, I might just like hard pitch it, Athena. Like, honestly, I might keep our call at the end of next week and just like, run it because I just know it's going to be a hard call, like based off our introduction call and like the very limited amount of friction that I put like, on the like, what success look like in 90 days from now, right? So like, I just know it's going to be difficult. So I want to expose myself to that and like, just get my reps in, you know what I mean?

[31:00]
Athena Simpson: And so like, And that's a flow thing, too. So when is your next intro call?

WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/289532279?timestamp=1867.9999

[31:06]
Austin Lortie: What's the next thing you're doing? Is it intro call or exploratory call? Exploratory with Morgan tomorrow, and then my next intro is Monday.

[31:13]
Athena Simpson: Okay, so what would be helpful before Morgan tomorrow so you feel prepped for that?

[31:18]
Austin Lortie: I feel pretty good about that, Athena. I'm probably going to get in at 6 in the morning like I did this morning and just run through that script. Like, specific to Morgan at least one time before, like, I hop in that call and have to give it live because, like, I did really well through your five steps. And then I got to, like, she gave me a few questions, which was helpful to kind of, like, break up the flow a little bit. But then I got to, like, the delivery portions, like, how do we deliver? And from there down, I was just like, like, kind of, like, over the place and, like, not as focused and dialed in as I needed to be. Be able to, like, read that and be really articulate in the process and, like, keep them engaged, you know, and, like, I can only do what I can do at this stage. But I just think that, like, reading through at least the first component specific to Morgan prior to that conversation, I think will lead me to have, like, the back half of that call a little bit better.

[32:22]
Athena Simpson: Okay, so that's, like, the GPT spit out of, like, the reviewing, like, the past call?

[32:32]
Austin Lortie: Um, what do you mean? I'm saying.

[32:36]
Athena Simpson: So, like, are you doing the GPT summary? Yeah, okay. That's not the part you're talking about reading?

[32:44]
Austin Lortie: I'm talking about reading literally the whole thing from start to finish before I ever get in front of him because, like, like I said, I did really good up until how we deliver. And then I kind of, like, fumbled that section and then, like, didn't do a great job on, like. Commitments before leading into price. I think I explained pricing really well and was calm in my delivery and the pricing component went really well, but it's that midsection from how we deliver to where I'm actually talking about pricing and the tie-down specifically towards the end of that section. So that's the component I think I need to work on.

[33:25]
Athena Simpson: Cool. It is long. I haven't figured out how to cut it down. I think, you know, keep running the full thing and then when you get it down, then you might start seeing like where... The reason why I want it all in there is that they know what they're signing up for. So there's no confusion about what the features are or what they get.

[33:54]
Austin Lortie: Think about... I just don't know. Like you've been selling with that, right, Athena? So like that's my... I have thoughts on ways that we could approach this, but that's been working. let's go prove that works. Let me get my legs underneath me a little bit. then it's just the same thing with, and you know this as well or better than I do, startup founders with a freaking 25-page deck, if they go and pitch an investor, they're going to be like, what the  is this, dude? You know, so it's like, I think that there's an opportunity to consolidate that and then handle a lot of the, like, more nuanced stuff. Like, after you drop price and have the ability to, like, build value and have more of a conversation as opposed to walking through a deck and just talking at someone, you know?

[34:45]
Athena Simpson: Yeah. But yeah, I mean, run it as it is. Like, you know, get at least, like, 10, 20 before we start really meaningfully changing it. Yeah, because that's been, you know, that was also developed over months with. And Cole Gordon's like sales coach who, you know, he really helped me like  up my clothes rate and get in there. So, and changed our pricing model too. Like he's the one that came up with the six month PIF because when I came to him, I was, I was telling people it was $5k a month. And I was like, I need to sign like at least four new clients a month to be able to make this work. And he's like, why not do six months up front? I was like, that's so much money. he's like, don't they have like $300k to $500k to invest? And I was like, to me, it was a lot of money, right? But I don't have half a million sitting in the bank, you know, like, so it's different. It's a different investment. And like, you know, I, I now I spend money on things that help me save time. Like I paid for meal prep. I will pay a local person. I have a local PA in Austin that would take my car to the car wash and do Amazon returns for me. Does that sound bougie? Yes. Was it helping me like focus on the $1,000 an hour  instead of the $22 an hour ? You know, like it's when you have the opportunity to make more money or when you do have that kind of money in the bank, then you view your time differently.

[36:19]
Austin Lortie: Yeah.

[36:20]
Athena Simpson: And so it's like, is it a good use of my time to go and wash my car or can I outsource it to somebody and get a  hour back of my time to focus on something that isn't a $1,000 an hour task, you know? Anyways. Okay. So for Morgan tomorrow.

[36:42]
Austin Lortie: I can pull this up too. I didn't mean to go back and modify that again with the, I finished our sales script also, Athena, like in terms of like the two sides that I have left and then I reworked the bottom four points.

[36:58]
Athena Simpson: Okay. Let me look at it.

[37:00]
Austin Lortie: Yeah. I consolidated them into three as opposed to four.

[37:34]
Athena Simpson: Okay. When are you going to teach them about equity injection?

[37:39]
Austin Lortie: Right there. So that's like, if you see the bottom component, so my plan was just to riff on this.

[37:50]
Athena Simpson: Bottom component.

[37:51]
Austin Lortie: Where it says, does that make sense? It's like, we built strong relationships with lender who recognize the value we provide. Many are willing to treat our fee as part of your equity injection. And essentially these costs act as a prepayment or the required down payment. Does that make sense? And then I could maybe, or like I could ask that up front and then walk into a more detailed explanation if you prefer it structured that way.

[38:15]
Athena Simpson: Yeah, because all of that might be word soup to them if they don't understand the equity injection, blah, blah, blah stuff. I almost might do it up front and be like, how much are you familiar with how SBA loans are structured? And you can, again, like defer to that. Like, so this is one of those, like you're a peer, right? And it's like, you know, SBA has like some crazy guidelines and how they structure things. So like, if you know this already, cool, but it was something I had to learn myself. Like how familiar are you with how SBA loans are actually structured and how your cash is applied to it? Something like that. So then you open up, and you can get an understanding of whether they're following or whether they understand that. Because if they, I mean, the people that understand it, like, I nearly hired a sales guy that he was, like, jumping out of a seat. And he was like, you can  apply it to the equity.

[39:17]
Austin Lortie: Like, how are people, like, this is a no-brainer for them.

[39:19]
Athena Simpson: Like, what the , you know? And I was like, like, he was just, like, gagging on it because, like, he understood that. He worked in the mortgage business for a long time, right?

[39:31]
Austin Lortie: Oh, that's interesting.

[39:33]
Athena Simpson: So when people understand, like, this is, if you are telling me that you are the 2% and you are going to close on a loan, then this is just you betting on yourself and prepaying your down payment to do so.

[39:49]
Austin Lortie: Yeah. Yeah, so maybe let's just change this to, like, let's just change this. The title in the slide to, like. SBA structure, and then what do you think about that? And then I can read the rest. Or we could do specifically sources and uses.

[41:06]
Austin Lortie: I'm going to say it this way anyway. I don't know. I'm like, it's just a different nomenclature.

[41:20]
Athena Simpson: And what other bit did you say you updated that I need to review?

[41:24]
Austin Lortie: This one, number two.

[41:27]
Athena Simpson: Oh, okay. It was just those two things. was another partner document.

[41:31]
Austin Lortie: Oh, yeah. And then, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I understand what you're asking now. It is post-basics transition. So team, you'll review, look at the partner slide, and then LOI results and testimonials.

[41:58]
Athena Simpson: I like the like that or one. I the is I think it's same I I Do we want to, like, hide this? Maybe. I mean, it's a good origin story, but...

[42:10]
Austin Lortie: No, I agree. I think I should kill those two slides just in the process, because, like I said, if I'm challenged on that at all, I'm just, like, not intimately familiar with that situation, so it's going to be, like, hard to defend, and, like, I don't get a lot of value out of that, if that makes sense. Like, not...

[42:29]
Athena Simpson: Yeah. I think you could start with something, like, our mission is to serve the 2%.

[42:36]
Austin Lortie: I... My favorite side, Athena, is, like, the... Just because you're the best owner for a business doesn't mean you're the best buyer for a business.

[42:46]
Athena Simpson: I... Like, that would be, like, my preference on what to start with. Yeah. Okay, great. Uh, our operations guru... guru... ... ... President, MBA. How about that? Yeah, I like that.

[43:08]
Austin Lortie: I spelled that wrong.

[43:09]
Athena Simpson: Thank you. Yeah, you're good. Great. love that, LOI results. Cool. LOI results. would just say something about industry, too, because a lot of times people are like, so some of the objections used. To be, well, if you've never done anything in my area before, how are you? Or what about this kind of industry, right?
ACTION ITEM: Add industry info to LOI results slide
WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/289532279?timestamp=2648.9999
So that's why I added that in at the beginning, because it's like, you can see that it doesn't matter what industry or where it is, or whether it's on or off market, we get signed LOIs.

[44:19]
Austin Lortie: Yeah, I can, I can add the industry component. Will you leave me a comment right there? Just so I remember. My testimonials is the only one.

[44:55]
Athena Simpson: Love it. Great.

[44:57]
Austin Lortie: All right. Last question for you. How are you feeling about... ... What we've accomplished in our first week together. Oh, great question.

[45:05]
Athena Simpson: Far more than I thought. Honestly, I didn't think I'd be leaving you on your own calls this quickly. So that just is a testament to my confidence in you and how quickly you're learning and your dedication to just like self-reviewing and improving. So I think you could do great.

[45:31]
Austin Lortie: Cool. Yeah, good deal. I just want to make sure we're on the same page there. I feel like I'm like, I feel like I've grasped most of the concept pretty quickly. And now, like, to your point, like we're just at that stage where it's like now I'm going to work on like the more nuanced, fun parts of sales, which like is extreme. Like that happened a lot quicker than I anticipated as well. So as long as you're happy, I'm happy. I just feel like I'm your first sales. I'm the first salesperson that you're training, so I just want to make sure, like, from your perspective, you feel like we're progressing along well.

[46:06]
Athena Simpson: Yeah, I think we're great. My only concern, which we've already talked about, is just embodying that value, like, even better than we found them. So I think it's probably just unlearning some of the tactics that, like, previous folks gave you, and I love that you're open to that and recognize it, and I think you'll be fine. And how are you feeling? Are you getting what you need to feel supported and get the most out of your skills?

[46:35]
Austin Lortie: Yeah, yeah. I appreciate, like, you give me actionable insight as, like, I'm not dumb and I'm not committed to, like, any sort of methodology or anything like that. Because, like, obviously you've found success doing this in the past, and, like, I agree with you in the sense of, like, the product that we're selling and the approach that you have requires a bit. softer of an approach than traditionally what I'm used to. So maybe the one and only thing I'd like to lean on you a little bit for, Athena, is especially after, and maybe we run through a couple intro calls, and I get a bit better of a flow, but I want to put a call in front of you and just be like, you're being an , you're being an , you're being an , this is a better way to respond, this is a better way to respond. And that would be invaluable to me, because if you can give me 7, 8, 9, 10 examples, I'll be able to find the common thread between them and be able to very quickly emulate that. So that would be maybe the one and only ask on my side, because again, what you're saying is not baseless, and it's not that it doesn't work, because in many environments that has been extremely useful for me, but I agree with you in the sense of the type, the folks that we're speaking with, we need to be a little bit softer. around the edges. So it would just be helpful for you to be able to identify specific areas, and then I'll be able to find the common thread.

[48:08]
Athena Simpson: Yeah, I love that. I'm totally down for doing call reviews. That's why I've booked us in for a lot of training next week, too, so that we can do that. And honestly, it's coming from 25 years of client servicing, right? So I can spot who's going to be a good client and who's going to be a nightmare client. Like, almost immediately. So the relationship, if it starts off from a very warm, connected place, it tends to be really great throughout the process, even when there's crunchy feedback on either side. So, yeah, like, I think, you know, like I said, if you flip into the coach mindset of like, how can I, like, help this person achieve their potential? Right? And, like... Do I think that they, so like as a coach or like mentor or consultant, that's the other thing is like having to do that with so many founders. It's like some of them are just never, you have to kind of give up on the ones that aren't going to have the recognition or the self-awareness to be able to like move forward, which sucks because I'm like, I want to like parachute in and save everyone. And that's, you know, based in my upbringing and stuff and something I've had to work on is just accepting that some people, I actually want to focus more time and energy on the people that see our value. Right. And like, that feels really good. And we had a couple of crunchy clients that are ending service over the end of services yesterday and the team were giving them more attention because they were just  and shouty. Meanwhile, our other clients are like, you guys deliver so much value. You're so great. And I'm like, I want to pour into those people, you know, and I want all our clients to be like that, that. We just love working with them, right? Even when they have tough feedback or we drop the ball, and we did on Andrew at one point, and I funded him all a month of service. I didn't need to, but I just, like, we forgot something that we shouldn't have, and I'm like, I'm just going to own it, right? And he was like, wow, I wasn't expecting that. Shows the character that you guys have. I don't like doing that for people that are , you know, or just, like, questioning my credibility. Like, it's not starting from a place of trust, and you really need to do that if we're walking people over the line of a multi-million dollar personal guarantee.

[50:42]
Austin Lortie: Yeah, I agree. I agree.

[50:44]
Athena Simpson: sent you the invite for that. Anything you need, just hit me up in the channel. You don't have any intro calls tomorrow?

[50:55]
Austin Lortie: No intro calls tomorrow. just have the one exploratory, and then... Going to, can I close lost up in your pipeline? There's stuff, there's stuff, and I'm talking like three qualified sat on the calendar. Let's have this conversation tomorrow, Athena. Sounds good. Okay, cool. Awesome. Great work. I'll see you in a couple of minutes. All sounds good. Bye, Athena. Bye. Bye.
