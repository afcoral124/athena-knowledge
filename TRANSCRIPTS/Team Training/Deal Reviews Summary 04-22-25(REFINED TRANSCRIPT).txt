AcquiMatch Team: other call there, the surgery was recently. So we have to just wait and see when that salary is going to be open to our call. So the goal, know, I asked him, you he's still playing out on his continues. Like right now, it's still my, that's still my thought that things for asking. I said, but you know, if we continue with this one, you know, and, you know, we're saying you're open still buying it. This isn't continuing. He's like, yeah, I'm, I'm so we still have some about there. Any questions on that?

[00:30]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Yeah. I mean, if they proceed with the business after they could like discontinue services with us, we, they still like the success we still apply is they just don't have us available to consult them through it. So I need to do some wrap up messages to the clients in terms of just like, hey, I know you're ending services. Here's what happens if you have any open deals. And, you know, if you change your mind at all, you can come back to me.

[00:59]
AcquiMatch Team: But we're,

[01:00]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): getting too close to the end of the month for me to be able to accommodate them at this point. So yeah, but sounds like it could be an interesting one for him, maybe little bit smaller and less like of a issue, but I kind of figured he was he was gonna walk anyway, just given the relaxing to move forward on the other stuff.

[01:25]
AcquiMatch Team: Yeah, I almost feel like regardless of the business, we give him, I don't think it's happening. But like I said, I talked to him with some things and he did not seem like, where he's at, he definitely like today, he was like, oh yeah, maybe this could work. And he gave a different type of energy than like unchecked out.

[01:44]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): So we'll see. I'm gonna stay up.

[01:47]
AcquiMatch Team: We call next week, we're gonna discuss everything. Okay, Jason gave the same feedback. However, this is something I want to bring up to you. Okay, so. So, he says that the Crown Office Suites business, he says that he's going to pass it to his cousin and his cousin is interested in buying it.

[02:11]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Okay. And he's still waiting us on paying us the success fee or is he not acknowledging that we source that?

[02:18]
AcquiMatch Team: So yeah, I did not like get there on that, I just tried to get as much information as possible. was like, so where's your, how's your cousin come into this?

[02:28]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Yes.

[02:28]
AcquiMatch Team: Yeah. I was like, you never told me that. He said, no, no, yeah, yeah, that was always the plan. was going to, you know, be a partner with my cousin and I was like, oh, okay, well, you told me that you said that in LA, like, how did you change that part of it where you said in LA, but now the cousins female, he's like, oh, I just introduced, I just said, hey, back my cousin's my cousin, he's going to take it over. So.

[02:55]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Okay.

[02:56]
AcquiMatch Team: Okay. I want to give you that feedback.

[03:00]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Um, and then did we talk about like ongoing or did that not come up today?

[03:07]
AcquiMatch Team: No, I did. asked him. He says he plans on this continuing.

[03:11]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Okay. Um, well, so I'll just remind him of like we pass it on. It's still do because we sourced it. Thanks for bringing that to my attention. Um, cool. All right. Anything else on that leave me feedback on or is that just an update?

[03:30]
AcquiMatch Team: And the same thing is JB is like, he said that he's going to submit an LOI for the client's business today. And if they want to move shoulder, then what? Well, he said he's continuing with us.

[03:43]
Luke Gillespie: So, like I said, 19.

[03:45]
AcquiMatch Team: I was in that business, but we got them to put together an LOI (not an IOI) and a video of himself. He's done. He just needs to submit that. If they invite him to the next steps, he said, oh, yeah, I need your guys help from that. So, so, thank you, I meant to say Jason Ryan or somebody said JB, and actually an update, he just messaged it in his Slack channel, the, the LOI to show you to take a look at to show you guys.

[04:12]
Luke Gillespie: Okay. Sorry.

[04:13]
AcquiMatch Team: So there's still a chance there. So we have, I've called schedule with them for actually to cover both those deals of, you know, the calls that are being kind of wrapping things up with them, seeing if we possibly move on. And then DL, we went over a lot over modeling, showing them how to model out the client's business. There was a portion of the no-change model that seemed to be over time, DSCR was going down, and I couldn't figure it out why. We had literally talked about every cell of this thing. So at that point, we're probably both all like, all right, what's going on here. So, I'm going to have all my agenda today to conclude that and shall see me. Why that's going if there's something.

[05:03]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): If it's a slight decline, that's normal. Like it won't stay the same because there's interest on the loan payments and stuff there. So like if there will be a slight decline over time, but do me a favor, like when you're doing the models with folks, just we've got the updates. Like if there's real estate involved and stuff. So what I'm doing is like, I'm just copying over their numbers to the most recent model, takes, you know, two minutes, but then that way, like real estate's accounted for in there too, because Mitch has done those updates, less confusing in terms of the real estate inclusion. But it will be normal because of interest and, you know, the payments that they're making and stuff over time that there would be a slight decline over time with the DSCR doesn't say exactly like 1.5.

[05:57]
AcquiMatch Team: So probably. send you over a link video with the modeling to the model and just be like, does this look like your thinking or is so so heavy or decline what we're thinking just to make sure I have a good explanation for them. I have a call for them to know I know they're going to go to some other deals. So I want to bring that to the call so I can make sure I've gotten back to my there.

[06:21]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Yeah and if you can just copy it over that new template just to make sure that there's no like, I don't know what version run so it should be all cleaned up on version three. So I just copy it over and do that and then look in the corner on the version number for other clients but should be okay. So yeah send over link video and then I can have a review of it before you call.

[06:44]
AcquiMatch Team: Okay. I'm to come in and let's see here. So, let me share my screen.

[07:09]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Okay, there you go.

[07:11]
AcquiMatch Team: Okay, so, you know, I was kind of. Typed up. Got some help from chat. We need to have a draft in response to the big business that we talked about last week that we sent to the client; they said they were looking for a strategic buyer, maybe overseas, but it was such and such. So I just want to say thanks again. It sounded like we built something special. Love hearing about the business and I kind of put some things that I already talked about. And then I said. Totally get that you're looking for the right kind of buyer and last strategic or national group might be my check those boxes. still love the chance to learn more. About what you've built and where you're headed, even if we're not the perfect for today. I don't have to be feeling the most. something work, but at the very least it'd be great to stand in touch and then open the conversation to see if they just want to jump on the phone.

[08:12]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Yeah, were you were you sharing a screen?
SCREEN SHARING: AcquiMatch started screen sharing - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/281583686?timestamp=499.658716

[08:15]
AcquiMatch Team: didn't see anything. Okay, here we go. Can you see what? No.

[08:26]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): So is this on top of the one that we already said like we're not interested?

[08:31]
AcquiMatch Team: This is yeah, that's right.

[08:33]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): So I feel like we should like probably cover that off and just be like, hey, just had a chat with the team. You know, we might have some like, even if one of our buyers isn't, if we might have some ideas of people that we can point you in the direction of, love to have a chance to learn a bit a little bit more. So this is like in the right direction, but I like, like we were like, uh we're not the right fit so i'd like to you know cover that off and just be like hey um i loved the sound of your business so i went back and had a chance to talk with the team we actually have some ideas um we'd love to learn more and you know even if we're not the right fit we can point in the right direction so i'd like to drop a little carrot in terms of what they'll get out of the call rather than them just be like i'm wasting my time it's like well regardless of what he worked with us i i hope to leave you with some information or something that's useful to you okay um so more else awesome thank you um anything else Ryan or good to move to David now okay so i wanted to ask you about this of market response that we got from um uh they are a law firm from Jacksonville and then
SCREEN SHARING: David started screen sharing - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/281583686?timestamp=585.092768

[10:00]
David R: It's just that we are not sure what to reply here because this is, you know, probably requires an actual lawyer to take over this business. So yeah. Do you know why we got law firms on that outreach? I think it was an old one, like very old. We were doing a lot of, you know, attorneys and so many people that were not right before. So this is an old one.

[10:28]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Oh, okay. How did we get attorneys? none of our clients are attorneys. That's frustrating. Okay. he's absolutely right. You need to be a lawyer in order to buy a law office most of the time. This is a law firm that must be owned by an attorney licensed in the state of Florida. So I'm just thinking about any.
ACTION ITEM: Audit all off-market campaigns. Ensure outreach only to businesses that fit our criteria. Remove lawyers/attorneys from lists. - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/281583686?timestamp=662.9999
Yes, conversations that we need to stop chasing them on. So if you can also have an action item from this, just go back through all our off-market campaigns, because it sounds like we're chasing them April 19, right? So let's just check that emails that we're sending are actually two businesses that we be engaging with, so lawyers, attorneys, you could just do an audit of all the ones going out and making sure we don't have any conversations going. So in terms of the response to this one, have you and the team discussed it? What do you think the response should be here?

[11:50]
David R: Yeah, we discussed it this morning. think it was yesterday morning. I thought it's... Yeah, you're right. requires an actual lawyer to take over this business.

[12:06]
Luke Gillespie: We had said Athena that we thought it was just a pass and we were going to reject it, but Ryan had brought up Athena wants us to not close off-market opportunities too soon, so that's why we wanted to bring it up the start of conversation today.

[12:20]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Yeah, good. I appreciate y'all listening and bringing these to me. Jack's have the lawyer dot pro. Yeah, so it's pretty obvious it was the lawyers. And that's where my head went to is like, how are we having these conversations, April 19th with the attorneys in the first place? So now I'm hoping that David, you can just have an audit of all the companies that we're reaching out to and just make sure we're not reaching out to ones that aren't a good fit.

[12:49]
David R: Who was this for? This is Jack; please don't provide a BH or CM.

[13:01]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): As their deals or how do we try to find out which client this was for?

[13:09]
David R: No, because this was some re-engagement, so he didn't have a specific person much. It was just an old deal.

[13:18]
Anke Badenhorst: Take one, NOS.

[13:27]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Oh, it was a re-engagement. Okay, that's why any moment out yesterday. This isn't a new campaign going out on behalf of anyone. You guys were just going through the old list and reaching out to people.

[13:42]
David R: Exactly.
ACTION ITEM: Investigate email address (Unrestricted Ventures) vs signature (AcquiMatch) discrepancy in outreach emails. Propose solution. - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/281583686?timestamp=826.9999

[13:44]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): I got you. Okay. Go back. Can I see the previous conversations? Okay. right. Okay, that's confusing. to have Unrestricted Ventures in the email address and then AcquiMatch in the signature. Anka, can we look into that?

[14:14]
Anke Badenhorst: Sure.

[14:15]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Because that, like, owners are getting hit up constantly, right? So that could fly us for spam or just weird stuff. If we're not saying, like, AcquiMatch delivered by Unrestricted Ventures and the email address is Unrestricted Ventures, but at my signature, it's AcquiMatch. So when we're doing this stuff, let's have an audit and just a sense check of, like, does this make sense? it make it slip, like, spam, sort of thing? And sorry, David. know that's not the purpose of your conversation today, but all these things for the first time helps me kind of give some direction there. So not that there's anything wrong, but I'm very cognizant. And I can't tell you how many times I've been out at an event. whatever. And somebody's like, you got in touch to buy my business and like, did I get so when you call it, when you guys are using my name, then, you know, chances are it comes back to me. We've had people like reach out and be like, is this even real? You guys are real. So we want to try to be cognizant of you were speaking as me. And also, we don't want to like anybody to think that we're fake or that we're spam or put me in a position that's a little awkward when I'm out there talking to people. So that's where this all is coming from is I'm not seeing these things on a day-to-day basis. I'm a little such with how to go back to this because technically we shouldn't have reached out in the first place. So my brain's like, do we say you're absolutely right and we apologize or how we respond to this one because we can't do anything with a law firm because we don't have any lawyers.
ACTION ITEM: Draft response to law firm as Athena. Acknowledge mistake, humanize error, explore potential referral opportunity. - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/281583686?timestamp=946.9999

[16:00]
Luke Gillespie: I mean, I would just say, like, you're exactly right, David. Uh, apologies for reaching out, but we must have gotten, you must have gotten mixed up in our system, if you want to admit fault like that, if that would be okay, I don't know. But just like, oh, you must have gotten mixed up in our system, but then it sounds like you're in an AI bot talking to him or something, you know, but I don't think there's a problem with just saying, all right, David, I understand sounds like it's not going to be a great fit.

[16:29]
David R: I wish you the best of luck. Yeah, maybe we can say something that we don't have. In about. But if we have in the future, maybe we can see your code back or something. I mean, we're sort of potentially good for all sources too.

[16:54]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Right. So he does a state planning. which might mean that he like helps, you know, people with selling their business. might be having a little fun with this one and be like, oh my gosh, David, I'm so sorry. Like, we were looking for accountants and accidentally got attorneys on our list. Please excuse me. However, you know, you might have clients that are looking to sell. Here's a little bit about us, you know, where this is an example of tech gone on ha ha. You know, like, so it's like, we're humanizing it. We're a small team. do represent like early amazing buyers. got our wires crossed. And this is an example of tech biting us in the bus a little bit. But actually, while we're here, you know, we do have a really great network of lawyers that we work with like with a amazing individual buyer. So Anka can help you draft something because she knows how to draft messages as me, but I'm always at the vein of like let's own it and then also there might be an opportunity here. mean like lawyers are trying to use technology too and it's like you know can sometimes bite in the butt. You might just not respond whatever or you might be like actually I have a bunch of clients that are always looking to sell because of estate planning in which case let's get on a call and see if we can help each other. You know right these referral networks can be very strong for us it's where we get a lot of off-market leads in addition to the stuff that we're doing. So that's how I might play it. What do y'all think?

[18:47]
Luke Gillespie: That's like a good plan.

[18:50]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Cool and if you ever want to draft something as me Anka has been writing white emails for the last year and a half. uh Kate's gonna get up to speed soon too um but it is important if my name's on it that we're just you know responding in a way that i would respond um which is not just shutting it down it's like it's weird we reached out and we were chasing and chasing and chasing him and just be like not a fit it's like of course you need to be like a licensed attorney in florida so like oopsies we had you on our accountants list it must you know gotten on the a's list somehow we're looking for accounting uh companies here's an example of tech gone wrong so sorry however um we work really nicely with lawyers that are looking for you know that have clients that are looking for buyers and we work with individual buyers that are real people they're not investors they want to you know extend the legacy um whatever and you might just be like you guys are crazy what the  like you've gotten touched to buy my business and then this or you might be like haha i totally get it attached  me. You never know.

[20:03]
David R: All right, sounds good.

[20:05]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Cool. I like this. Keep bringing him to me and then I will be making some time to get a little bit more involved and go through the whole off market with y'all and just see where we can add some magic to get, you know, those little things. It seems very authentic, I realize, when I'm like, the email address doesn't match the signature but this is like a long history of branding, trust, working in intellectual property, businesses, etc. So the best way that I can describe it is, you know, when you go to a concert and there's like the official merch inside and then there's the people outside that are selling the band t-shirts but like one letter is off or sent and you know, and you automatically distrust it. So like when there's when there's anything that's ajar, then it plants a seed of distrust in people's minds. while it feels pedantic, actually, it's like rooted in our psychology. And there's a reason why brands spend so much money on getting their brand in front of you, because that familiarity in that moment that you make a decision is what determines your purchase, right? When you're tired of looking at different toothpaste, you see the one you recognize, you're more likely to grab that one just because you recognize it. But if they change their logo, then all of a sudden you're like, what is this? don't trust it anymore. So these things actually have a really interesting impact. And if they have a good interaction with us, when people, and we have this all the time where people circle back and they're like, well, I'm not, but I know some of it is. So if we make that like a good experience, and we stand out differently from everybody else and show that we're real humans, we're not just like random spammers using tech and like whatever, then they're more likely to come back to us and bring something to us. or when they're ready they'll come back to us. all of this is kind of woven into that overall experience that we're delivering with people and it kind of starts with making sure that we're being different than the other folks and making sure that everything is kind of buttoned up and looks and is perceived as real people that are doing the reach out even if we are using tech. Does that make sense?

[22:24]
David R: That's great. Yeah.

[22:26]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Cool. I used to do so when I was at Guinness World Records I created products that we franchised out to companies all over the world and they were event products and everybody in the business because it was an intellectual property business. If anything happened to that brand like that could ruin the business so it was very uncomfortable for them to franchise their brand to anyone else. So I'm like events professional and I ended up to be like a brand and IP like manager, right, as the kind of overseeing these franchise debates. And I thought it was kind of dumb at first too, but it was just drilled into me, the importance of like, this is a legacy, heritage brand, you know. And everybody believes in Guinness World Records because they are so pedantic about records, their brand, everything else. It's the only thing that creates value for it, because if people are like, oh, they give records to anyone or they don't, they don't, you know, manage the records right or, you know, let anyone have a record or anyone license the brand, then it causes a huge problem for the business. I got school very early in my career about brand management and that comes through. Anka will be able to tell you, but like the capital A and M, you know, always writing it the same way, like that sort of repetition and everything, it's like It's not just Athena being like detail oriented, it's built on how do we build a brand that people trust and recognize and come back to. So I used to do brand trainings for businesses, for founders, for startups. I know we all have a lot on our site, but when we have some bandwidth, if anybody's interested, I have this really fun. I think it's fun, but you all also know I get really excited about financial modeling, brand training that kind of explains how a brand is built and the things that aren't perceived under brands and that sort of thing. I can run that with y'all at some point. And it's not a 12-week thing, it's like an hour or two where we can go through it and it's fun. you realize like, oh my god, and what was so interesting for me is like how manipulated we are and we have no idea that it's happening. And y'all know I do not like being controlled by anyone I don't like. know, people doing things unknowingly, and it's actually very manipulative. This whole branding thing that these large brands do, and how they get into our psyche, and how they use psychology against us. So I like teaching people this, because once you see it, you don't unsee it, and then you make different decisions as a result of it. So, anyways, that's a rant you weren't expecting about asking how to respond to a law firm. So thank you for involving me. Oh, very cool. Okay, anything else on the agenda? One quick point, but anything else you want to discuss today?
ACTION ITEM: Develop system for team to easily capture and share client learnings/insights (e.g., Slack emoji workflow). Present to team. - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/281583686?timestamp=1537.9999
Cool. So you might have noticed in the deal channel, I shared something that Gil put into the chat about how specific wording is required by the SBA on performance-based seller notes per the attorneys. This is a really important kind of a information and insights that we will often get from clients as they go through this process, we can learn through them. And although the performance note and theory is, know, sound, underserved things, the language, I'm like, that's interesting, right? So what I want you all to put your heads together about is how do we create an easy system for us to capture these moments when clients learn things that would be of benefit to all of us to understand an easy way to do that. Anka, that's probably you coming up with a system, but I think the team will all have feedback like, I've heard this before in Slack where there's like a certain emoji that you can do and it starts a workflow or whatever. But I guess the outcome that I want to see is how do we make sure that these learnings, these moments, these things that clients teach us through their own experience aren't just getting lost or only told to one person or it like, you know, left in a way those things. share it and create a company repository of information so that we're building that knowledge base internally, that everybody has access to the more that we grow, the more that people are working on deals, et cetera. So what I don't want is a trap in my head, or my head, right? how do we, or like Luke, when you see things and things that they feed back on after the booker says, blah, blah, blah. So what is a process that we can do that doesn't like, it's not too much of a lift, but we can forward it to something or put an emoji on it or forward it to a specific channel and then we all review it. It's like, oh, that's interesting. So we're learning together. That's something I'd really like to see because again, like all of the knowledge sitting with one person is not a great way to grow as a company. It's also not good for anyone's development if you don't get exposure to that kind of things. But we also have a lot to do and all the things that we do independently. So let's find a quick way to be able to. grab that and share it somewhere. Also, hopefully I'll be getting a, Kate, didn't tell you this earlier. I had a long chat with Wendy from Live Oak last night. There is some serious call with all of the SBA lenders today from the SBA administration. There's gonna be some pretty big SOP changes coming. So they're doing a conference call about it today. Apparently it's going into effect June 1st. Wendy said she'd do an update email with what those things might look like, but just something for us to be aware of. It sounds like it's going to impact primarily folks that are looking to get investors to cover the majority of their equity investment because those are the loans that are defaulting the most, these searchers that are getting investor to do the down payment and they're the operator so those are the ones that are defaulting. So our clients won't. be affected if that is the SOP change because all of our clients are pretty much bringing their own equity. It sounds like you can still bring in an additional check. You just have to be the majority equity injection giver as the buyer, but that's all hearsay right now. So just something to put on y'all's radar if you can notify me or actually throw out the deal channel if you guys see anything any whisperings about SOP changes and that sort of thing and we'll try to keep each other up to speed on that as it will impact us and our clients. But like I said, it doesn't sound like it's going to have an impact on our clients lately because we choose clients that can do the deals without investors. Cool. Any questions on that? Awesome. give you 19 minutes back. Thanks for all your time today. And thank you for filling out the agenda, David and Ryan. All right, I missed it, so I'll make sure to click into it next time so I can actually see where it's at and have my own stuff. Awesome, have a good rest of your day y'all and I will see you tomorrow.

[30:12]
Luke Gillespie: Thanks.

[30:12]
David R: you.

[30:13]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Bye guys. Bye.
