  So there's a million things that could be talked about there. Yeah, I didn't—I apparently didn't sell it well enough to Josie. Only one turned up though. I was like, this is so important, like you guys need to watch this. Yeah, yeah, I guess Jason couldn't make it. He's usually—he would have appeared. I think he went along this one, but actually he messaged us and said he couldn't make it. Yeah, well when people get close to LOI you'll have to give them a little homework list like, hey, you need to watch the insurance thing because that's gonna be a big one for you to understand. You know, so at least we have these things to be able to direct people to, because Anka and I were talking about that earlier—like we now have so many Buyers Club meetings that when new people come in we want to try to give them the, like, here's the priority for you to watch these in, because something like today is not really relevant until you—

1:00 - AcquiMatch Team
  you're staring down the barrel of an LOI—just signed an LOI.

1:04 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  as opposed to like the seller meeting conversation, right? Some of the discussions that we've had are more relevant earlier in the process, but I'm loving these.

1:17 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  What'd you think of that, Luke?

1:18 - Luke Gillespie
  Well, yeah, it was awesome. I was just gonna add in, maybe periodically—client by client, for example—when, say, Jenny's about to do a seller meeting or something, we have Anka hop in the channel like, hey, check out this buyer's company when we went all over this. But yeah, that was great. I think we should clip that two minutes of Andy saying the oil spill is not a contamination issue and send it to Brian.

1:40 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  And there he is.

1:42 - Luke Gillespie
  It's not a deal-breaker. We should send that to Brian.

1:45 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, good idea. So cool. Well, Brian's got to go in like 15 minutes. So if you want to go through your stuff, and then if Luke and I need to stay on a little bit later, I've got an appointment I need to get to tonight.
  ACTION ITEM: Find emails w/ Joe & Matthias re: equity injection language. Compile for referral process doc. CC Anka. - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/222217304?timestamp=122.9999  So it wouldn't keep you too late, Luke, but if it will be useful, then okay, cool. Yeah, so let's—give me the highlights then. What's the 15 minutes’ worth of stuff that I need to know or you need my help with?

2:13 - AcquiMatch Team
  Okay, so the first thing is just one question. Jason's asking, what's the best way to frame your consultation as an equity injection to lenders? He's thinking to—we talked about the lender who doesn't know us, so he wants to be able to pitch it correctly in terms of like, can this be included in his equity injection? I thought it an interesting question—thought I would ask you.

2:36 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, so you should be on the emails with Joe. There should be some language that I wrote up and gave to Joe when he was talking to that lender that didn't know us, so see if you can dig that out and then send it back to me and then we'll just add that to the referral process document. Remember—and also get with Anka, because she sees it on emails where Matthias and I talk to one of his lenders. So basically what they want to see is our service agreement. And then the way that Tuni described it is we're the architects of the deal. So it's really important that they don't call our fee a success fee. That will basically null and void it. So they need to call it a consulting fee. You know, it's a transaction expense. We're part of the deal team that's consulting and advising them as part of the process. And then the fee is business-specific. So if they think that we're just sending them a bunch of deals and then they're adding it in, it won't necessarily be—then that would kind of negate it—but the fact that we're finding them a specific business and advising them on that specific business, then we're—you know, this deal wouldn't exist without us. Tuni's like, you're essentially the architect of the deal.

4:06 - AcquiMatch Team
  And then that broker that you're referencing to—that conversation with Joe—when was that? I could just build everybody else.

4:13 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  And you were on it. Remember when Joe was speaking to his local lender on one of the earlier deals that he was looking at getting financing for?

4:26 - AcquiMatch Team
  Yeah, if I'm on it, I can find it. I'm trying to think about which deal I was on.

4:30 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, it was the first one, I think, that he was excited—I can't remember what deal it was. I just remember he was speaking to a local lender, and there were panic stations about our fees and that sort of thing. So you were CC'd on all those emails. And then there's a pretty good explanation in the email that went over to Matthias and the lender that we were talking about. And the copy of our service agreement usually is what they want to see. And then I'll also say, like Live Oak’s Head of Credit has already approved this. They've looked at it—usually if they know that the larger banks that are top SBA lenders are okay with it, then they follow suit. But you also need to tell Jason this is the risk of you going to a lender that's not familiar with us. So we'll give you the language, but it's on you; you know, we're not going to go in there and negotiate this. So that's one of the risks of you going to your local people that don't know us. We don't have that established relationship. So, yeah, get with Anka—she'll be able to dig out that email—and you're CC'd on an email; compare the two. I think I wrote the exact same thing for both of them, but you'll just have some language there to be able to give them and then add that to y'all's referral process. So you have that that you can just copy and paste and send to the clients. The main thing is: tell them not to call it a success fee—it's really important. And you should be coaching clients on that. Tell them early on, but they'll probably forget by the time they get to the lending process. So just also make sure that you remind them of that when they're at this stage: hey, don't call it a success fee. We're an advisor to you, just like a lawyer. We're part of your deal team. So you need to position us as such. Because even with lenders that know us, you just need to be careful—if it's “success fee,” then it can cause problems. Cool.

6:26 - AcquiMatch Team
  Um, then just updates—a call with a coach tomorrow morning.

6:35 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Great.

6:36 - AcquiMatch Team
  I’ll be speaking with her to talk about something we discussed on our last call that really ended up last time. I was like, see if we can get her on a call—got her. So she sounds optimistic.

6:47 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Great.

6:48 - AcquiMatch Team
  Yeah. That was her language. Um, Brian—I got him on a call today. I had a call with him and just, uh, yeah, we discussed—just kind of—

8:00 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay. So that's what he's working on right now.

8:03 - AcquiMatch Team
  That's what's distracting him, is transition there in that business. He says that it is, but when we talked about it the first time, he was saying that things were really slow because it's a seasonal business. So he gets slow right now. It's way too slow for me. You do need to have somebody else that's going to work, but I do—what season? It's out of season. It's been a sad season. So they're okay. I’m like, well, take your time on these two businesses, get all your questions, and get back to me. That's just a little bit about how he has been.

8:39 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Said he would get better. Okay. Great. Nice work.

8:46 - AcquiMatch Team
  And then JB submitted two LOIs. I think both structures look really good. First he told us he wanted to have $2 million, right? Then he checked it for $2.5 to $3 million plan. Then we reviewed the financials and adjusted based on the most recent information. And the two offers that Joe put together were $2.1 and $2.5 million. And I think those are really—if the seller—he can't ask more for that. He got you both deals, fast work. One is literally a 5% seller note with SBA, and the other one's $2.5 with a big seller note—but that's for $2.5 million, right? So I think it looks really good. And the seller sent me an email last night, so I know he's anxious—like, he's nice. So we'll see what happens, right? So I got my fingers crossed about—

9:48 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, nice work, congrats.

9:51 - AcquiMatch Team
  Yeah, thank you. And yeah, JJ is still working through hers. She's about to follow up on the buy-side meeting with them. Talked to me about the LOI—sort of her structure. I went over the model with her. She's been pretty close to submitting on that one. I think she's going to get back with Barlow and Loya—really nice—before she submits. And then she’s also drafting a book of what it would look like to sit on this washing business as well, in case that’s a work—she’s just—and then we'll talk about it. But she likes both the children. So she seems pretty happy. She has two businesses that she is interested in submitting an offer on. And, you know, those are pretty much the most important people to cover at this time unless you have any questions about anybody specifically.

10:53 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  No, I don't think so. I think—just one thing to note with Matthias: because he is an SBA broker, we need to be careful on that one, and I'm seeing him get really pissed off on social media that people are coming to him after they already have term sheets. He's like, don't waste my time if you already have a term sheet. So I think just keeping Matthias in our back pocket—if people are having issues with lenders or getting lending, and/or if they just want someone who's also going to hold their hand through the process, right? So that's kind of what Matthias is going to do, but he's very much like one at a time. So Tuesday, Lindsay's going to come on and we're going to talk in detail: SBA process, going to seven different lenders, pluses and minuses of working with a broker and not working with a broker.
  ACTION ITEM: Update lender ranking sheet. Move Matthias down. Add Wendy, Tuni, Matthias. Note when to contact each. - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/222217304?timestamp=704.9999  So just encourage everybody that's at that stage, especially Jason, to join that one or watch that one afterwards.

11:55 - AcquiMatch Team
  So then what I'll do with Matthias is I'll rank on the sheet that I'll put together in terms of lenders—I will rate them accordingly. So I'll move Matthias down and I'll just put like Wendy, Tuni, Matthias, and note when each one should be contacted.

12:12 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, it's like, if Wendy and Tuni can't get a deal done, then it might warrant going to a Matthias. They already have a relationship with Wendy, so, you know, it should be easy for her to look at it. They just need to be really careful with her that they don't tell her they're shopping around, because she in particular gets very pissed off because she spends a lot of time with people. Lindsay loved working with Tuni. She said he was fantastic. So, you know, he's a good reference. I have another SBA lender—who was at the event last week—I'll talk to you all about him. He's really well known. I'm going to meet with him next week, but Matthias is also very effective, but he's more of an “I'm going to walk you through the process” kind of thing. We get much less of a referral fee because Matthias works off the lending referral fees. Not that it's a huge drop in the bucket for us, but Matthias doesn't like—he's like, if you're going to other lenders—so start with those two; maybe we add a third in direct-to-lender with Jared, if that feels good after I talk to him and kind of tell him our process. And then Matthias is like, if we're having problems getting term sheets for somebody in particular, it means a lot of hand-holding—then Matthias is a good person because he's a broker and he's that kind of buffer between the person and the lender.

13:43 - AcquiMatch Team
  Okay, cool. I'm there. Everybody else is pretty good.

13:50 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Amazing. Cool. Luke, do you have a couple minutes to update me on the other clients? Then Ryan, I know you're going to get kicked out of there. So if you need to jump off, all good. You and I obviously will have time tomorrow too if you want to dig in deeper on anything.

14:04 - AcquiMatch Team
  Absolutely. Talk to you guys tomorrow.

14:06 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay, thanks Ryan.

14:08 - AcquiMatch Team
  Bye guys.

[14:09–14:26 REMOVED: scheduling/traffic small talk]

14:29 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  But business-wise, it was really successful, so I'm really happy. The event yesterday—you know, since I'm kind of the founder and the leader of the business, I don't have anyone that's managing me and mentoring me, so I look for opportunities to go and learn from people or put myself in situations where I'm getting coached and I'm getting mentored so that I can be a better leader for you all too. There's a real estate brokerage called Real, and I found the president—this guy, Sharran Srivatsaa—and he was on Leila Hormozi's podcast. Just the way he was talking about the values, ethics, culture of the brokerage that he manages, and how the brokers are independent and just everything about how he is as the leader and manages his life—I was like, I want to learn from him. The event yesterday was for real estate brokers—marketing, like how to get buyers and get sellers. I was like, I'm sure there'll be some transferable stuff for how we can get off-market leads, but also I want to see how he interacts and what the company culture is like and that sort of thing. It was really cool. The people that are part of the Real brokerage are obsessed with it. They’re all creating exceptional content and it was meant to help all these folks be better at running their independent businesses, which is what real estate brokers are. It's what all the brokers are—even the Transworld folks and that sort of thing are still considered independent contractors running their own little business under the brand. It's not a W-2 job. The content—I mean, if I were a real estate broker and I implemented everything that I learned yesterday, you'd be earning seven figures easily. It was really good—really tactical, but also inspirational mindset. It was awesome.

[Personal anecdote about approaching the presenter and DMs removed]

18:55 - Luke Gillespie
  That's what you hear from all the most successful people. They tell you when you're young and up and coming: just go try and work for people for free. Don't even ask for a job. If you have someone that you want as your mentor, just do free work for them before you even tell them anything. Just send them the work that you've already done before you even have a working relationship, and eventually you'll catch their eye or something like that. So I see you.

19:22 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  I mean, but, you know, when you're also a business leader, there's nobody giving me performance reviews. I don't have a manager, so I need to surround myself with people that I aspire to, that I can learn from, that can mentor me and give me feedback, right? And it's like, if you don't have those people, you can still get in the room with those people. You can learn from those people. So, you know, I will spend money to get that kind of mentorship and that coaching and that guidance because I won't get it otherwise.

20:00 - Luke Gillespie
  It seems like a big expense on paper, but actually when you look at the return on investment in your business when you do that sort of stuff—you know, the sales coaching that I got last year, the stuff I'm doing with Alex and Leila and their Acquisition.com stuff—you can see the impact that it's already had on the business and the impact that it is having on the business.

[20:49–23:09 REMOVED: extended praise/thanks, team-culture and health anecdotes]

23:09 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Anyway, yeah, no, it's good. I'm really happy to hear that. I'm so, so blown away by what you all have been able to achieve. I mean, it seems normal to us because we're all really high performers, but if you compared us to another early-stage business—and I was going to tell you and Ryan that; remind me to tell you all in the team meeting tomorrow—one of the sales calls I had today was with a guy who worked with Acquira, which I've known about, but I've never actually talked to anybody that went through their program and used them for deal sourcing. But he's like, yeah, they were sending me like one deal every two months and, like, no off-market deals; and then the off-market deals they did send were completely out of my deal box. And I'm like, are you serious? And they charge way more than we do. Really? Yeah, I think I'm looking at their website right now. I had another program mention these guys to me before—I think I took a look at their website. The website looks great, but I guess they're not really doing very good work. One deal every two months? Yeah, I mean, that's horrible. Ah, you know, but it's kind of cool to hear that too because, like, we feel like two is a little—we want to get more than two, you know? But that's like, what, 4x what they're providing. Yeah, exactly—more than that. One deal over two months—anyway, I can't do the math this late. I've got to go in a few minutes, so how are you looking, or how can I support you? Do you need any feedback from me? Feeling good? I can—
  ACTION ITEM: Complete 2 write-ups for SP business (commercial fencing). Follow up w/ broker for NDA. - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/222217304?timestamp=1490.9999

25:00 - Luke Gillespie
  Give you a quick summary. Let's get into it. So I have an SP business. I'm going to do two write-ups after this call—after my appointment later as well.

25:07 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Thanks.

25:08 - Luke Gillespie
  It's a commercial fencing business. I know SP are going to love this. They love commercial, and it's fencing. It's like 70% recurring revenue, like 39% profit margins. It's this guy—he has to go away out of the country because he inherited some land; he's got to go develop. And his mom is the one who actually started the company. And she's not some old lady—she's like an active 60-year-old woman—and she wants to stay on with the company. So she basically knows everything there is to the business. So yeah, I did the broker call this morning. I'm going to do the write-up after this call and my appointment. And yeah, I'm waiting to get the NDA from the broker.

25:43 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  I guess he responded to my email. I'll give him a call after this call. But yeah, that's where we're at for SP. So I'm really—I know they're going to like this one. Nice. Yeah. I remember—I feel like we've looked at a fencing one for them before, and they really liked it. So—

26:00 - Luke Gillespie
  One listing that they requested from us personally for that other deal a week or two ago—it was commercial landscaping. And Polly—what she really liked about it was that it was commercial.

26:10 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  That's why I'm excited about this one for them. Nice work. Cool. And last we talked, there were a couple coming down the track for Andrew.

26:19 - Luke Gillespie
  So how did those go? Yeah, unfortunately, a call today—it was this online business. It was like a teaching/education business, and it looked like it was going to be really good. But then as I dove into one of the Excel files they provided right before our call, I was preparing for the call—it was originally listed as 500k SDE, and then they changed it down to 300k SDE. So I canceled the call, and the broker emailed me back: we got updated year-end 2023 financials and it was lower than expected. And the CEO—the guy is working like 40–50 hours a week. So we wouldn't put that in front of Andrew, because it changed from like a 300k SDE for Andrew to like 100k. Ryan said we could be okay showing some smaller businesses to Andrew, but not when this guy's working 40–50 hours a week and bringing in 100k, so that was a good thing.
  ACTION ITEM: Discuss w/ Ryan re: presenting diesel repair shop to Andrew w/o full vetting. Prep write-up w/ verification areas. - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/222217304?timestamp=1628.9999  Then I'm still chasing those two deals from those ATK Ventures guys and they've kind of just been lagging on me. If worst case scenario, you really want to push out something for Andrew—without even having all of my questions answered—I really think this is a great business. There's this diesel repair shop that they have listed. I did do a call with the broker and I didn't get to ask all my questions—it was more of a meeting-each-other call—but I got insights into the owner who he is, and I can already tell just from the CIM that it looks like a really good business, but I haven't done the full vetting questions. They told me, send the questions over email. I sent it to them over email. The guy just told me yesterday he's going to send it to the owner. I called him again today to check up on—he didn't pick up. So that's where I was at on that one. Do you want to wait to see if they get back to me, or do you want to push something without doing a full broker call/vetting?

28:09 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Is it competitive or are other people looking at it?

28:16 - Luke Gillespie
  When I asked, I don't think he said it was, but it looks like a really good company that would be competitive and other people would be inquiring on. I'm looking at my notes right now because it has around $1 million adjusted SDE and it's semi-absentee—like 20 hours a week. The current owner—he's in the Bahamas right now running the company, so it could be perfect for Andrew because it's in DFW area, but it's semi-absentee, remote-run.

28:48 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  I have a—like, so I don't like when they're like, send the questions over, because it buys them time to start accepting offers now. Right. So then it's like, I feel like if you feel really good about it, then we can go to Andrew and be like, hey, these are the questions I have out with the owner or with the broker, but also it's such a good business, we don't want to lose time that there might be people making offers. You know, the next thing you could do then is go back to the broker and say, hey, I really want to get my client—he's kind of perfect for this. Can I get it in front of them?

29:30 - Luke Gillespie
  And then we can loop them in on these further conversations. Yeah. Yeah. And looking back at my notes from the call—so he said this seller, you know, he's not looking to give it away quickly, and he's firm on his asking price of $5 million. So it doesn't sound like a—

29:47 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So it's 5x.

29:48 - Luke Gillespie
  Okay. Yeah. But it still leaves good SDE—I'm pretty sure DSCR for Andrew. I forgot both calculators. But so that's where we're at with that one. I feel good about it, and I know we're trying to get something for Andrew for this last month, but it's just not playing out the way we wanted with the broker answering our questions. Sometimes when they say send the questions, they're stalling because they're entertaining offers. Interesting. Ryan said—because he had worked with this broker before and said he knew very little about the business—Ryan said, I was surprised how little he knew actually. And this is when I started—we shifted the conversation like 10 minutes in after meeting each other to the business. He was like, oh yeah, we normally like to have you send your questions over email, and then we send that to the owner so that they can answer themselves and then you get a lot better answers. And I was like, well, okay then. And he said he has this real estate deal coming up that he thinks Andrew would be a perfect fit for. I was like, oh yeah, I'd love to see that as well if it's coming up soon. And so that's where we are. They gave me access to some extra financials about the business. But yeah, it's just been kind of moving kind of shady the way they're acting. Like, when I sent for another business I had inquired upon—it was a metal fabrication shop; they're located in DFW, they do some work in Oklahoma, so again could be a good fit for Andrew—and again they said email the questions; I emailed the questions. And then I called the broker's sub-broker or whatever, and he said, yeah, so a lot of the questions that you asked could be answered by the additional information I'll give you in the deal files; there's a Q&A in there and everything. And so then he gave me access to the files and the Q&A wasn't there; there weren't that many extra files. And that's why I've been chasing him again trying to get—so I'm really just doing everything I can for Andrew. And maybe if we make it real with this broker that we do have a genuine person and make an introduction—that, like, you know, because that's not really a good seller relationship either, to have all the questions like over—

32:00 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  email and then be sent to the seller—wouldn't be ideal. What do you know are the next steps? Like, if we were to bring Andrew into it, at what point or when can he meet the seller?

32:11 - Luke Gillespie
  I want to remember—I think the broker was pretty open to—he's like, yeah, you could have Andrew meet the seller. Because maybe we just do that and get that relationship started if you think it's a good business. Okay. Yeah, I mean, I think it's good. And I just—I don't feel great about the two businesses we got Andrew this month. That's why I'm willing to kind of—I was kind of feeling like pushing this without doing the full vetting questions and just, in that areas of verification section on the write-up, I'm just gonna include a lot of questions.

32:45 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, just say, you know, time kills all deals. This broker is kind of acting as a weird gatekeeper—

32:52 - Luke Gillespie
  and, you know, we'd rather get you directly in touch with the seller on this one because it sounds like they are facilitating that.

33:00 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Here's all the questions that we would ask after that. That's what I would do—double check it with Ryan, do the write-up in that way. Double check it with Ryan and then get it over to Andrew so that we can cut this—if this broker is creating this whole like, oh, I'll send it to the seller and then they'll get it back—like, we might as well just connect Andrew to the seller.

33:23 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah, yeah. I've already shown him the buyer profile. He knows about Andrew. He's like, yeah, sounds like a great guy, a great buyer. And so they talk really nice, but then they don't really answer my questions when I get to them.

33:36 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah. Well, sending a bunch of email answers is not what the owner is going to want to spend their time on. So that's—like, if they're doing that with all of the prospective buyers, it's a waste of time. So what would be better is if we can get Andrew meeting the seller—if they like each other, then they can go deeper and get those things answered.

33:57 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah. This broker—they have really good deals though. I don't know. They claim to be a Christian brokerage—they just get deals through their Christian network and deals—but yeah, both the deals are really good. That's why I'm so excited about them. So yeah, I'll talk to Ryan tomorrow. Ryan—he really likes to do the broker call because that's a big part of the value we provide to our buyers—our clients, sorry—but that's why I'm just saying it's the trade-off of not doing the full vetting versus we really want to get Andrew something. So that's why I'm bringing it to you and Ryan to ask your guys' opinion. Yeah, well, whatever he says goes—he has final say—so you run it past him and see what he thinks tomorrow. Awesome.

34:38 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay. Great. I need to run, but great work as always. If you need anything else in addition, let me know and we can find some time tomorrow.

34:48 - Luke Gillespie
  Yes. Awesome. Yeah. I will talk to Ryan tomorrow and we'll make a plan.

34:54 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay. Great, Luke.

34:55 - Luke Gillespie
  Nice work. Yes. Have a great night. Bye. You too. Bye.
