Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Yeah, the adrenaline kicks in and you're like, Amazon, let's go. you know, I just like buy off Andrew too. Like, I think he's got such a good, I get a lot of energy from him every time I talk to him. So, you know, it's like, it's easy to kind of like bounce off of him because he's just fun to talk to and he's like, I mean, he explained concepts. I've heard million times. It's just like, like, oh, that's such a simpler way to put it.

[00:00:56]
AcquiMatch Team: So what did you all think of that? Oh, it's great. But he was an excellent guest to have a good timing too.

[00:01:05]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Yeah, what did you guys learn anything new? I imagine commercial real estate might be new to most of you.

[00:01:12]
David R: Yeah, yeah, for me, very new, like it's very technical, but I think it's really nice to have this knowledge, especially now they're looking at the different deals. And, you know, of them have real estate included. And I know it's a benefit for the deal, like 25 years of amortization and these things, also it has risks, you know, like, and it's nice to know, like, okay, what kind of risk has this specific deal for a client because they probably have to look deeper into this in, you know, in the next stages. So yeah, I think, I was actually thinking like, okay, is there a way for me to look? in this first stage that I look at videos, is there anything else that I should be looking at regarding the real estate?
ACTION ITEM: Double/triple client's max purchase price before eliminating deals; push larger deals through as medium priority - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/246705840?timestamp=129.9999 Like, you know, if probably there's a risk that I can identify in the first stage of the process. So, yeah, it's like, it made me think a lot of this concept in the first videos.

[00:02:20]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): It's a good point, David, and something that as you were talking, I was thinking about is like, a lot of times the brokers will smash the real estate into the purchase price. So, we might eliminate something because the purchase price is too big, but actually, if we look at it again and realize there's a whole bunch of real estate involved, especially with the sale leaseback technique, you know, like to arrange somebody else to buy the real estate and somebody like a client buys a business, it increases the purchase power significantly, but a lot of these brokers aren't necessarily being savvy enough to like list to business as the business price plus real estate. might be like like lumping it into the overall cost. So then in which case, if we're having limiting factors on the high end of the purchase price, maybe we need to re-evaluate that and see, like is that inflated because of real estate? Being involved if so, we should still be pushing it through.

[00:03:20]
Luke Gillespie: Yeah, that's a good point, Athena. I never thought of that, David, but yeah, I guess if it says purchase price $10 million, and then it says real estate included, but it doesn't tell you the price of the real estate versus the business, you might think it's too big, but maybe it could still work. And maybe you should still push it and just mark it as low priority input in your initial notes, like real estate plus business question mark, and then I'll figure it out from there. That's a good point, Athena. Yeah.

[00:03:50]
David R: Back to getting linked, yeah.

[00:03:53]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Well, and like, I don't really love eliminating businesses that are too big unless it's like wildly too big. You know, because we tripled Lindsey and Kevin's buying power with creative structuring. So they were, they were pre-qualified for $800,000, but we were able to, you know, they bought $2.4 million worth of businesses because we were created with the structuring. So it's more the low end where it doesn't meet their minimum threshold, but unless it's like a $50 million transaction or something, like I don't love eliminating the larger ones. So I don't know what parameters you guys are putting on the top end, but, you know, it might be something to look at, especially when, I don't know if it's still happening, but clients were saying like, these are coming in pretty low. It's below the income that I like, et cetera, et cetera. So like on those larger businesses, we're able to give them, and most of them are open to bringing investors or, you know, so just using their pre-qual as the limit is not something we should be doing because we can automatically double.

[00:05:00]
Luke Gillespie: double whatever that number is that they got as a pre-qual. Yeah, just by having a 5% seller note. Yeah, and we haven't just been using the pre-qual as a ceiling, but that's another good point. Athena, maybe you could start being more open-minded with higher price deals and not don't have to be so strict. the way we've been operating right now is, let's say someone told us their max purchase price they're looking for is $5 million and that's what they were pre-qualified for. Maybe if it's a 6, if it's a 6.5, we'll still push it.

[00:05:32]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): But if it's a 7, that's probably going to be archived. maybe we should start about that because I wouldn't archive it.

[00:05:39]
Luke Gillespie: Yeah, exactly. That's what I said. That's a good point. And if it's 7, I wouldn't archive it.

[00:05:44]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): And here's the thing, people are scared, right? So they're going to be like, I don't want to go beyond this amount. But if we find a business that is like perfect for them, and it's a larger business, that they are amazingly qualified to run, that actually reduces the risk overall for them to buy a larger business that is a perfect fit for them because there's more infrastructure and everything in place and it's less risky. So I would double add a minimum whatever they say their top end is before we eliminate it.

[00:06:16]
Luke Gillespie: Okay, sounds good.

[00:06:18]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Because we're getting this a lot where people are saying that these deals aren't big enough and I'm wondering if it's because we're eliminating the larger purchase prices that would get them that larger number, right? And I don't see a lot of big deals coming through and I'm like why is that? So I would double if not triple the amounts, you know, on the top end before you eliminate it.

[00:06:43]
Luke Gillespie: All right, sounds good. Sounds good. Yeah, because I didn't even run into a deal before where it was really going to sell at $4 $5 million but the broker listed it at $10 million to keep tire kickers away. sometimes that happens but I guess for those ones that might be massively Overpriced David keep them at like a medium priority and don't don't put them high priority because there's so few of those will really work out so But yeah, that's a good point. We should share real estate-involved deals like that off-market Ryan's working on.

[00:07:13]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Like what are you saying that real estate's like 11 in the business is three or four or something? Interesting So and it's a great business and the sale leaseback technique might be Amazing if chris can't take down all the real estate himself, you know for some buildings or whatever Um, so if that would have come across your desk at 15 million asking price and you guys eliminated it for chris But you know, so that's why i'm saying they maybe go at least triple Whatever they're saying they're comfortable with because we know is structuring and then and then Coaching them a lot of them are keeping it small because they're scared But they're also doing this because they want to change their financial outcome So if we keep pushing them on things that are just at their minimum threshold It's going to be really hard for them to get there, but on these bigger deals.

[00:08:03]
Luke Gillespie: Yeah. Yeah, David, let's start implementing that.

[00:08:07]
David R: Yeah. All right.

[00:08:08]
Luke Gillespie: Because Jason, it's also kind of a client feedback thing as well, because Jason, we didn't really know until he told us now he's much more open to bigger deals. We showed him a $6 million business and he was super excited.

[00:08:22]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): It comes with confidence too. So like, you know, when I started looking at deals myself, sorry, I just had a timer go off and I have to scan this thing. Okay, apologies. I have a very timely thing I have to do every day at a certain time. So when I started looking at deals, I was looking at $100,000 laundry mats. Because it's all, because I was scared of anything bigger, right? And as I got more comfortable and I was like, okay, no, at like a million dollar print shot. And now I'm looking at a six million dollar car wash. But actually, like the the real estate itself was three million. And he wanted three million for the business. And I was like, business is worth 1.2, you know. And interestingly, knowing what I do now, I could have probably done the sale leaseback thing and like gotten that car wash from John and sent him off to his little alien car wash. And and then and then I found, you know, million dollars. So it's like, as I got more, and then I was looking at a business that had like, it was like a 12 million dollar event rental company that had 17 million dollars in inventory of five locations, you know. So it was like, their confidence level increases the more that we get deal in front of them too.

[00:09:50]
Luke Gillespie: And that's what we've seen with Joe and Jason, they increase their appetite, the more experience they got.

[00:09:56]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): So yeah. Yeah, but also, what does a matchmaker do? Does a matchmaker give someone exactly what they ask for in a relationship?

[00:10:07]
Luke Gillespie: No. Why are they going to a matchmaker in the first place? Because what they think is best for them, which might even be different than what they're saying they want. Does what they need, not what they want.

[00:10:19]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Right. If somebody's going to a matchmaker, because they haven't had success in their dating life thus far, right? So matchmaker is going to be like, I'm going to hear you, but also I'm going to put people in front of you and like, here's why, you know, I think you should, this person actually has long-term potential and here's why you're going after this thing, which is like childhood trauma, trauma bonding, not a good fit for you, you know, versus this person who actually is like a really good fit and here's why I think you should do it. So we got to remember that our role is to guide people towards the right fit, not just to listen to them and go and look for exactly what they say that they want. They've never done this before. So that's what they're looking to us to do is like, look at opportunities and push them and coach them and advise them into the right direction. So it can be easy, especially with the Jason's to just like, be like, oh, you told us he wants this, but it's like, we also want to be looking at deals and David, this starts with you because you're the very first person to look at them. So you can't just take exactly what they say and do that, right? Like, we also need to be evaluating things like, in our opinion, you know, maybe they didn't, they wouldn't even thought of things before. So like an example that I use a lot is Lindsey and they said they wanted to be more involved in the community. You know, they have a certain disposition about them that other people don't. They're very calm and easy people to work with. And then this dance studio came up and I was like, oh my God, like, I see them being like such good dance studio owners. And I'm guessing none of you have experience with dance moms or theater moms, but they were their own breed.

[00:12:05]
David R: They are crazy. but Lindsey and Kevin, I'm like, they would be perfect with dance moms.

[00:12:11]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Like they have that kind of personality. And then I reached out to Lindsey and I was like, Hey, have you like, what's your experience with dance? And she's like, I was a competition dancer growing up. I was like, Oh my God, you know, and so they didn't put dance studios on their list. But I was like, I see them in it. This is perfect. want to push them on it. So had the broker not misrepresented SD by $100,000, then they would have like, they went and met the owner of love them. They were very excited about buying that business. our job is to see things that they don't necessarily see and push them on that and coach them on that. That's something that Ryan's really good at is like, Hey, I know you didn't necessarily have this in mind, but in our opinion, this is why we think you should consider this. So just be careful not to like completely. Just follow their direction because they haven't done this before they don't look at the number of deals that we do They don't have the number of conversations. Most of them have never been a business owner before That in itself is a whole new skill on an experience, right?

[00:13:14]
David R: Yeah Perfect, okay What else did we take away from the real estate discussion?

[00:13:22]
Luke Gillespie: It was cool to learn about triple net and kind of how the negotiations can work between a bundle buyer and a landlord and Realizing, you know, how when the seller owns the business and the real estate they could there's benefits to charging themselves Lower than market rent and there's also benefits to charging themselves high market rent So it was interesting. I was just really excited about triple net I always see triple net in the Sims and I just read over like okay It's triple net like Now you understand what it means.

[00:13:50]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Yeah, exactly Mm-hmm, but you can also look to see like were they charging themselves triple net or are they saying the new person is gonna pay triple net Yeah, and did they account for that and and the SDE adjustments.

[00:14:02]
Luke Gillespie: Yeah, for the rent, exactly.

[00:14:04]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Rent taxes, repairs, insurance. a lot of times that's paid separately by the entity that owns the real estate. It's not necessarily reflected in the P&L. So you need to make sure that if they were, if they're going to charge triple net to the new tenant, new owner of the business, that that is reflected either in the P&L that it was coming out of the business, P&L, right? Or that they've done an adjustment in the SDE. So does that make sense? Because like the entity might have a separate P&L because they're going to have an LLC for the business, they're going to have an LLC for the property. So if they're not reflecting the triple net in the business P&L and the property LLC was paying the insurance and taxes, et cetera, you need to make sure that's

[00:15:00]
Luke Gillespie: that that's reflected and that's something we can catch for our clients before we send it over to them. Yeah, exactly.

[00:15:08]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Does that all make sense, Luke? This is like, this is awesome. took me months to wrap my head around.

[00:15:14]
Luke Gillespie: No, I understand. It's pretty simple.

[00:15:16]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Yeah, I get it. Well, yeah. Right now, would you any any big uh-huhs or takeaways from that?

[00:15:24]
AcquiMatch Team: Yeah, I think the- I love that he referenced the sale leaseback in my mind if you're not sure you've set up for that. Um, and I listened to the podcast after we talked. Um, and I was kind of just like, wow. Uh, but then after listening to speak, he definitely like brought me back little bit more, which is the key thing to keep in mind in that podcast is that he really did a good job of going to go shave the multiple. at the beginning. So he lowers the debt service and then he has more room to pay this higher rate for this fixed amount of time. So it's kind of like, you kind of lean the podcast thinking that say a least back, but really it's like step three, right? It's like if you get here, this is an option, but these things have to line up and what are the first two things I need to line up is the relationship with the what the seller, like he he built that relationship, he flew out there, he looked at his P&Ls, he kind of made a deal of confidence. We can do this and that kind of set them up to probably propose a multiple that would have continued just to him and the seller felt confident that that was the value because this guy has experience in those things doing. They probably had a lot of confidence in him and because he was able to negotiate that purchase price. they could utilize that sale leaseback and still have some room, some little room there.

[00:17:06]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): It's a really good point to pull out from that. It's like the multiple matters, right? If they're at a four or five and they want to try to do the sale leaseback technique, I might not leave them a lot of like wiggle room if they're selling it to somebody else.

[00:17:21]
AcquiMatch Team: Right. I mean, it may put them in a good position for the next two or three years and then I'll say that you're hurting if you don't grow the business because it's cost.

[00:17:29]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Yeah, super good point. I love that. I love these questions.

[00:17:36]
David R: was just going to say also when he was talking about the opportunity zones, like I was thinking if there is a way for us to identify these zones and maybe much those zones with the zones that our clients are targeting, know, and maybe, you know, fine if there is an opportunity for them to, you know, to be on these opportunity zones. So, or some deal targets this opportunity zone, so it be, it would be cool to see if there is something in there.

[00:18:07]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): I think it's a really good point. And, you know, first point might be just grabbing the opportunity zone map and matching it to all of the client's geographic preferences and identifying which ones are looking at opportunity zones. And then that's even more of a tool in the transaction, because like, yeah, the, like, no taxable event to use your 401k and put it into a property, you know, and you're probably going to get a higher return on a property that's similar to the robs, but I think you could skip the robs in that case to do it.

[00:18:48]
Luke Gillespie: Yeah, it was interesting.

[00:18:51]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Nice. I love that idea, David. Um, sounds like there's just a map that you can pull and I'd be interested to see what clients are like looking at opportunity zones. Opportunity zones, just in general and sharing that with the team. So maybe that can be part of our when we're setting them up, looking at the parameters, like it's a note on each client's account, like what areas are in Opportunity zones. So then when Luke's doing the write-ups, he can say like, hey, this has real estate and it's in an Opportunity zone and that unlocks extra benefits for you. Cool. Awesome. Okay, so how are looking with deals? Where do we want to dive in?

[00:19:35]
AcquiMatch Team: Do you want to start?

[00:19:38]
Luke Gillespie: Sure. As far as new updates since Tuesday, when we attach my external monitor, nothing new since Tuesday except for one write-up we got to Justin.
ACTION ITEM: Introduce Justin to broker Derek Polly (CGK Business Sales) for fake pets e-commerce business - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/246705840?timestamp=1182.9999 Ryan presented that to him today and we just heard a few minutes ago that he likes the business and I'm going to introduce him to the broker today. You will call. Well, how did that call go with him Ryan?

[00:20:07]
AcquiMatch Team: Well, great because I actually think that business looks really good. So yeah, yeah, so it looks like it over. then I kind of looked at it, I like, interesting. And then I was appeared into one or five, five, I grew up. I was like, oh, actually, is, this looks pretty awesome. So I was pretty enthusiastic on the call. Now we set up another call. First thing in morning tomorrow. So today was just the intro call showing in the business. I'm going to get some homework to review the juice.
SCREEN SHARING: Luke started screen sharing - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/246705840?timestamp=1241.586781 Put together a list of questions and then we're going to go for the first thing in the morning. Well, Luke, if you could, the strategy here is for you to make the program go out or after this call. And then that way, the broker says I'm available tomorrow, me and JG will already have our call coming first. think in the name. So the broker can schedule the call as soon as possible.

[00:21:07]
Luke Gillespie: Yeah, I'm going to do that after this call. I'll do the introduction.

[00:21:11]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Oh, what is their fake pets?

[00:21:16]
Luke Gillespie: Yeah. And so they like they breathe and then it's yeah made in China, e-commerce, but 50% online on Amazon, 50% of retail and a bunch of random gift shops and they're in every cracker barrel in the United States.

[00:21:39]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Wow, cool.

[00:21:41]
Luke Gillespie: I just didn't like that.

[00:21:44]
AcquiMatch Team: Yeah. mean, he just got to learn what I told him about it, but now he's got to actually go do everything, listen to the call and all that stuff. I thought it was just There's thoughts tomorrow morning, but yeah, you know like this is cool Yeah, even said the location was really good for him super close to him.

[00:22:10]
Luke Gillespie: I looked at the map.

[00:22:11]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Yeah. Oh, it's in Austin It's in round rock. Yeah. Oh . We got to move fast fast fast on this one then Yeah So that's what we did the most probably have the call first thing in the morning great. Yeah, and then getting him introduced today Who's the broker?

[00:22:27]
Luke Gillespie: Uh, Derek, let me— Derek Let's see— Derek Derek, Derek actually it was Derek Polly, CGK Business Sales He was a cool guy.
ACTION ITEM: Investigate why company names aren't consistently appearing in CRM; fix CGK Business Sales entry - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/246705840?timestamp=1366.9999 He liked me.

[00:22:52]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): liked what we're doing. He liked you Company is showing up Oh here. Yeah, uh, normally they are Sometimes they aren't Okay What are we doing to make sure that they are showing up every time I could do I can I can second I mean Let me figure that out, you know, I'll get on that next yeah, cuz we want to make sure like so click on Derek What is this company not showing up?

[00:23:37]
AcquiMatch Team: Well, it depends on how we input them into the system So it's gonna take me speaking with me to them make sure that that's done So I'll use this one as an example and I'll see exactly how this deal is created and then I'll make sure that there's Yeah, perfect.

[00:23:52]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Don't fix it Luke so they can look into it. Can you just search CGK? I feel like I've dealt with them before You Oh, my God. That's my property management. Of course, I know CGK. That was that was the property management deal that I went after. So I know Jason very well. I don't know Derek. This is why it's important to have the companies on there, because Luke, you should be checking the connections before you talk to them.

[00:24:33]
Luke Gillespie: OK.

[00:24:39]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Because that, like, if they look up the CRM, I mean, I wasn't writing from, it was sort of an unrestricted venture, so they might not even make the connection. But yeah, it looks like Jason, did we have some other deals with Jason? Is Ryan sent? I know when it goes, okay, that's interesting. So it was like my contact, but the note from Ryan in the re-engagement. So it sounds like Ryan never had any conversation with him. Okay, we need to tighten up some things. David, this is going to be on you when we do the re-engagement with brokers, and then we need to make sure that he does making all those connections. Cool. Okay, CGK was... Search CGK again, was another broker.

[00:25:39]
Luke Gillespie: It was Derek.

[00:25:41]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): No, there was somebody else that was the main broker from that company. Can you click on companies?

[00:26:00]
Luke Gillespie: Right there. No, when you're searching, see, okay. Hmm.

[00:26:08]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): So it's not even as a company. Okay.

[00:26:17]
AcquiMatch Team: No, Ryan, let's look into this.

[00:26:20]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Okay. But let's also make sure, like, all live deals have broke the companies attached to them and that everything is kind of connected so that when we, when we have these connections, we're able to, like, I want Luke to be able to go into there and look and use that be like, Hey, our founder actually worked with Jason on a deal for months and 22 and that might get you some good will there also because Jason really liked me.

[00:26:55]
AcquiMatch Team: Or any

[00:27:00]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): any deals that were like, when we have people, when you make an offer, broker takes you a lot more seriously, so it could just help your life a lot more Luke to look at the connections before you just dive in. Or if they recognize our name, and you're jumping on a call with this person, and they're like, I've dealt with you before, I've spoken to Ryan, what's going on? It can create confusion. So even more important for you to check the relationship before you jump on those broker calls to see what interactions that we've had with them, because this business has now been in existence for a year and a half, plus the year and a half of my own searching that I did. Do you understand why that's important? I'm not getting much back from you.

[00:27:45]
Luke Gillespie: No, I get what you're saying. Yeah, so I can bring it up and I remember you.

[00:27:49]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Yeah. Why do you think that's helpful?

[00:27:52]
Luke Gillespie: Because we already built rapport in a relationship with them, if they had a good experience with you and Ryan before, they're going to be more likely to want to work the best before, or if they liked one of our

[00:28:00]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): the buyers from before? Yeah. And or we need to check if there was any issues, right? if one of our buyers didn't follow up and close something out, if it went south, the broker didn't like them, whatever. And that's that's an objection that you're going to have to overcome early on. Or could be something that causes like another buyer issues down the line.

[00:28:20]
Luke Gillespie: Yeah.

[00:28:23]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Cool. I was like, I know CGK. I'm like, that sounds so familiar. Yeah. that business, that brokerage changed my whole life. So it's why we're all here. Cool. Okay. other deals are you in the chat room?

[00:28:41]
Luke Gillespie: I don't really need to talk about anything. I have a whole lot of hot deals here.

[00:28:45]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): I'm just chasing brokers to try to get them on calls. Cool. What do we got coming down the track and for who?

[00:28:51]
Luke Gillespie: I have a package of five Cold Stone Creamery for DL. I had are open to franchises? Yes. Okay. I have, it's more of a telecommunications company, but kind of IT adjacent business for Gill. Pretty big, good size. I'm doing a call tomorrow for this one.

[00:29:16]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Sundeep Gill. definitely know we've spoken to him before, also company missing. So get, you know, to do a big old clean up and make sure that this is happening. I remember talking to him, I think he liked us a lot. Okay, so they've interacted with SP, depending on how SP handled that. We'll see how he feels about us, right? So again, good to just kind of pick up and understand what the relationship was.

[00:29:58]
Luke Gillespie: They never met SP, a gun. move to loss before one more.

[00:30:01]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Okay.

[00:30:09]
Luke Gillespie: But yeah. So I'm about for Gill. I have that's so funny.

[00:30:16]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Is it called Gill Company?

[00:30:17]
Luke Gillespie: No, that's just his last name. Sundeep's last name.

[00:30:21]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Oh, okay.

[00:30:23]
Luke Gillespie: Yeah.

[00:30:23]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): thought I said the IT business was called Gill. That would be funny. So Sundeep Gill or Gill, our client. I would point that out on the broker call with him and be like, funny, you know, anything to get some sort of like affinity or like goodwill or get them to chuckle, like they'll love you.

[00:30:40]
Luke Gillespie: Yeah, yeah, exactly. I have this aluminum metal and steel manufacturing for DL. Working on that.

[00:30:50]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Cool. Some good ones coming up from then, huh?

[00:30:52]
Luke Gillespie: Yeah, I have another manufacturing business for Jason. I'm working on And then I have, yeah, this one for SP, I'm working on auto repair business.

[00:31:07]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): I have, I feel like they said they didn't want anything auto. Why am I remembering that?

[00:31:14]
AcquiMatch Team: For SP.

[00:31:16]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): They did at the very, very beginning.

[00:31:20]
AcquiMatch Team: We had to switch up their whole industry list. And I said, no, we're more open. We realized we were too narrow. We want to actually just see more opportunities to more deals. So we removed all of our restrictions.

[00:31:30]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Great.

[00:31:32]
Luke Gillespie: I have a RV food service. I'm also looking for JJ, but she's already, have her. I have a pending business waiting to let this broker know what Jenny thinks of it. And Jenny hasn't responded for two or three days. So I haven't even been able to get a call scheduled for this business yet.

[00:31:52]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Okay.

[00:31:53]
Luke Gillespie: And then it's a SaaS email marketing company for Jason that I'm working on.

[00:31:58]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Um, let's. Make sure when the clients are the ones holding us back, we're making this very known Ryan. So like if she loses this potential deal or like if we're not able to move this deal forward, it's like, hey, Jenny, you said you wanted more deals. We can't move forward. There's a way that we do this. So it's just again, making them very aware when they're the ones us back from delivering a good service to them.

[00:32:25]
Luke Gillespie: Yeah, and I guess I'm being frustrated by just because Jenny sees so few good deals. And this is one good deal that could be right of like having to wait two, three days.

[00:32:34]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): They love travel and being outside and like RVs are like the definition of that. So come on.

[00:32:40]
Luke Gillespie: And his, her, her husband loves cars and anything automotive. And yeah, and you know, a day or two can be the difference between an LOI signed or not in this space.

[00:32:49]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): So. Yeah, for sure.

[00:32:55]
AcquiMatch Team: Cool.

[00:32:58]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Good stuff. of who uh so yeah you want to give me an update on so right and i realized like we've we've now gotten a few clients to LOI but like this is the first time kind of sitting in past LOI so i want to make sure we spend time on these calls talking about that so it's not just you and i learning the process together and we can impart it on the team of like what happens post-LOI what's the strategy and what order how do we guide the clients through it and stuff so i know you take the lead in a lot of that but we i have had the opportunity to impart real time of LOI stuff on to you so let's make sure we use this this time to do some of that too okay let's do that now cool um so yeah i feel good about that um as i've listened to some of these podcast people do they keep referencing relationship and we have talked about that but it's becoming even more quick oh like you know with a guestry at all now but not

[00:34:00]
AcquiMatch Team: relationship to the ability to people. So yeah, um, Jason, uh, we came up with a plan to wait two weeks to get back to him and then write something personal to him. Say, hey, you know, thank you. I remain interested. Um, you know, love the business. I could see myself as, as the buyer. Um, and yeah, we got a, we got a great response from the seller. He said, hey, thank you so much for reaching out. You're, you're a good guy. He said that, um, to Jason. Um, and yeah, and we have, um, we have the term sheet, uh, from a lender, uh, that's saying that they can, they're open to qualifying the deal on following the fight from November till now, from a P&L. Uh, so we're working with the seller to get that information. They're supposed to get it by Monday and we're going to follow up on Monday to make sure we have that, but right now, that's kind of back and running.

[00:35:10]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Okay, can we see the term sheet? Nice, so, but I should have said, good job getting it back online, and helping Jason find a solution.
SCREEN SHARING: Acquimatch started screen sharing - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/246705840?timestamp=2144.372158
ACTION ITEM: Guide Jason through commitment letter details; discuss working capital, equity injection, and next steps - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/246705840?timestamp=2145.9999

[00:35:56]
AcquiMatch Team: In terms of, like, the most kind of specific. take thing to this particular deal, well, here, firstly, rate 2.125 prime plus, and then, this here is kind of what they altered to make an exception for Jason, which is the receipt of 2024, November 2024, third year to date 2025, are satisfactory.

[00:36:35]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Well, can you go back up to the top?

[00:36:38]
AcquiMatch Team: Yeah.

[00:36:40]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): All right, so things that we want to be looking for when we're going through this, hmm, in the uses, the working capital, is that working capital that should be included in the purchase price? Like, what is the working capital that they're including in there? Where is that number coming from? That's what we want to make sure that Jason understands why they're adding in the number. Um, so is it just an additional 100 working capital for him or did they determine that that's the working capital requirement in which case are we overpaying for the business because we didn't get working capital included. What did the deal have in terms of working capital?

[00:37:24]
AcquiMatch Team: We've got to be cutting on the number of working capital. So, um, they kind of went back and forth on that. They said, Hey, let's move forward. Let's get in front of a lender. They're going to tell me what the work capital is. We'll discuss it at that time. So.

[00:37:42]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): So this is what we need to be like looking at and talking about with Jason. Right. So like where did the working capital number come from? And also do we need to reduce the purchase price at a future point because of that. But first of all, like where did the. number come from. That's the first thing. It's like, Jason, do you understand how did they determine the 100k? Where did that come from? are they saying that? And we also want to make sure that they've included our consultancy fee in there. So that's really important, right? Because they can swing the loan pretty considerably if they don't. So in this, they've included it in there. That's great. We want him to confirm with them before he signs anything that the fees that he's paid us thus far can count towards his equity injection, which they are saying is 190,000. So to date, he's paid us 35,000. So then is that going to be deducted from his equity? How are they going to treat the fees that he paid so far? So just making sure he confirms all that before he signs anything to work with bank. Now that work is capital of the 100K could be the additional deal costs, right? And they usually just lump it under working capital. So QV, legal, guarantee fees, et cetera. That might be what that working capital number is. That's why we need to like, where, what does that working capital get number get determined by? And it might be, oh, are your deal costs. In which case, he has no working capital in this. And the seller is not giving him any working capital, which is what, what, what does that cause for Jason?

[00:39:37]
AcquiMatch Team: I mean, yeah, he won't be able to sell us the lab.

[00:39:42]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Yeah, like we need to make sure that, like, in one way or another, working capital is, is, is covered. Either the seller provides working capital. So like, how did that, I'm guessing that additional 100K is actually deal costs. Legal, or QV, et cetera, yeah, because we estimated like 5% so I'm guessing that's what that number came from, in which case he still is going to need working capital. when they're offering these, are they also going to offer a line of credit to them at close? And I know this is through Matthias, so I'm guessing that he's delivering that. But what we need to make sure is that they also have wiggle room money after close. Cool, interest rate, I know Jason's trying to get that like knockdown, but that it kind of is what it is right now, like 2.25 is pretty standard over 10 years. Scroll down in the next page and see what's on there. I'm doing this for the benefit of everybody kind of talking through. So you'll notice in collateral, a life insurance policy on Mr. Brewer in the amount of the loan. So this is something that people will have to get when they close on the business, they'll have to get a life insurance policy so that if he dies, the bank gets paid. So that's standard for SBA, but just, you know, making sure he's like getting the costs of that and ideally speaking with our insurance guys sooner than later because he doesn't have to pay the insurance folks, just make sure Jason's doing insurance due diligence also on this business, especially because there's a labor involved, it's manufacturing, he's going to have to get life insurance. So like, does he know what that costs going to be? And then the debt service coverage ratio of no less than 1.25, that's pretty low. So this, this lender is pretty risk tolerant, right, but we still want to treat, try to keep our clients at around 1.5, even if the lender is willing to go lower, just because that's like us helping them make sure that they have enough room in there. So we will, they can go down to 1.15 by SBA guidelines. So this lender is saying 1.25, which Live Oak is 1.5 in most cases. So Live Oak is the most conservative of the bank. So it's another reason why if Joe doesn't get favorable terms, we want to have them go to multiple lenders because some of them going to be different on this.

[00:42:40]
AcquiMatch Team: So yeah, so even if update on that is Live Oak is 1.5, if it's not one of their preferred industries, if it's a preferred industry, then they go down to 1.25.

[00:42:56]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Yeah, which, and they don't have many preferred industries, I don't think. But there's some that they hate. think automotive is one that Live Oak. So like they don't love those, but I think what's important for us to just bear in mind is even though the lender is willing to go down to 1.25, we want to be really careful letting the client go below 1.5, especially if it's like an industry that they're brand new, if there's a bunch of risk involved, like we want to kind of keep them towards the 1.5 range just because that gives them more cushion after they take it over, and also making sure that they have access to a line of credit or working capital when they close on the deal and making sure they're doing a Q and V, you know, to figure out that working capital pack, et cetera. So, cool, this is all kind of standard stuff, go to page 3. Yeah, so the SBA is going to charge the borrower for legal fees, filing, closing, guarantee fees, all of these additional fees. And then over a million is when the guarantee fee goes like much bigger. So like Lindsey and Kevin tried to negotiate that their amount was like less than a million because they found out on their first deal. And then also once you sign on with somebody and you're like, okay, I'm going to move forward with you, then they take a deposit from the borrower to go through all the process, right? So this 5000, this is for the lender. This is different from like the broker asking for money in escrow, which we never do. This is for the lender to like go through the willing process. They're going to ask for this good faith deposit and that is normal and expected and they won't get a lender to move forward about them. doing that. So it's different than a broker saying like we want you to put this money in escrow.

[00:45:04]
AcquiMatch Team: Does that make sense on the difference there?

[00:45:09]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Cool. Yeah, all this stuff looks pretty normal. But what I like to do Ryan is just like scan through this when you get it and see if there's the money. so that's us, we're the agent. So you need to make sure that we're getting the right forms and everything filled out because we're going to get paid out of that loan. So that's the big one. And another reason why I like to see the term sheet is like did they put our fee in there. Because guess what? don't get paid if they close and they forgot to add that in and we didn't catch it early enough. Cool. I bet that's the first term sheet, David. What do you think, guys?

[00:46:14]
Luke Gillespie: It's cool to see the backside of the process. Yeah.

[00:46:20]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): So this might actually be a commitment letter. Let's see. Go up to the top. Yeah, it is a commitment letter. Okay. So they've done some initial due diligence. So sometimes just send a term sheet. This commitment letter when he signs this, that is like, I am choosing you as my lender. I'm paying you $5,000.

[00:46:39]
AcquiMatch Team: We're moving forward. So you want to like sometimes the term sheet is just like an initial like, here's some rough terms that we're willing to do a commitment letter.

[00:46:48]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Like we've already looked deeply at the deal. And so when he signs the commitment letter, he should only sign that with one lender, the one he wants to move forward with. And they all use different terminology like prefix. fly, term sheet, commitment letter, some skip the term sheet and just straight to commitment letter right. So this one's pretty exhaustive. So this is a commitment letter. So when he signs this, it's like, I am choosing you as my lender, I am not going to continue discussions with all other lenders. It is like, he will get backlisted in a heartbeat if he goes through this process with multiple lenders at the same time, and he's going to pay them all money to do it. So another thing that it's, it's, it's one of those things that we assume that people know, but we can't assume that they know. So like, that's what we have to coach them through is making sure they understand the process. And also something that caught Lindsey and Kevin out was like, every lender pulls credit at different points. So making sure when they engage with the lender, the lender's like, hey, out this buyer form. And if they don't have that conversation with the lender, like, at what point do you pull credit? can you talk to me before you pull my credit? So these guys might have already pulled credit in order to get his commitment letter to Okay. So it's something that they need to have that discussion to make sure that that's what they want to do. term sheet is usually pre pulling credit to like, you know, do some initial underwriting to see if they, you know, want to issue a commitment letter. Every lender's different. may or may not tell you that they're going to pull credit. So that's where we want them to get their free annual credit report themselves. So they can send that sometimes the lenders are fine with them sending that as opposed to them pulling credit to have an initial look.

[00:48:36]
AcquiMatch Team: Cool.

[00:48:37]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): So then the other thing I wanted to talk, any questions on this? know that you're more familiar with this with David and Luke, but I want them to learn through us too.

[00:48:49]
David R: Yeah, I don't think so. I mean, it's interesting to see these numbers and these things, yeah.

[00:48:56]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): I'm glad it's interesting to some people. They're like, ah, paperwork. Um, or I love it though.

[00:49:02]
AcquiMatch Team: Um, I think the big big thing maybe to make clear that I didn't in it first while I first started doing this is like, um, David is the like, um, the SBA, there are, there are lenders underneath the SBA. So it's not like, uh, this is just like one big organization. There's different lenders. So this one is one of like three lenders that Jason reached out to. So that's why the sheets are all different. And that's why if he didn't want us to look at it, must be because based on each lender terms can be different. So that's the big thing that I didn't know about SBA. I thought it was like a program that I realized there's always some lenders underneath that weren't within those guidelines.

[00:49:50]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Yeah, that's a really good point Ryan. So SBA is like the government program that lenders can take advantage of. the reason why lenders like it is because 75% of the loan is guaranteed by the SBA program, which means if someone defaults on an SBA loan that a lender issued, then the lender only has the exposure of 15% of the loan because 75% is covered by the SBA. The buyer needs to put up 10%. So it only leaves them a 15% exposure. And the way the SBA program works is that first the lender has to go after the business and liquidate all the assets in the business to try to say someone stops paying the loan. First the lender has to go after all the business assets. After they've liquidated and got all the money out of the business, then they go after the person themselves. That's why so many people even though it's a business loan. is the huge risk that these people are taking by signing onto an SBA loan is like they're personally guaranteeing it. So they're, you know, stock accounts, they're savings, their homes, like certain assets that they own, the bank will come after that to cover whatever of that 15% that they are not getting. And then the SBA will only pay the bank that 75% once they've shown the SBA that they've gone after everything they can first. And then they go back to the SBA and they're like, okay, make us whole on everything else we didn't get.

[00:51:35]
David R: Oh, well, very low risk for them.

[00:51:39]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Exactly. That's why so many banks want to take advantage of these programs. But not all banks are good at it because the SBA has a whole bunch of guidelines. And then there's the difference between banks that are not preferred lenders. So if you're an SBA preferred lender, you have an in-house team that can make decisions on the loans. A non-preferred lender has to go to the SBA on a loan and say, please, can you sign this off? SBA and those non-preferred lenders typically don't have enough experience to know how to get one of these loans approved by the SBA, because there's so many conditions and requirements because it's a government-backed loan. So, yeah, because of that, each bank has its own way that they determine risk. The things that they're interested in, the things that they're not interested in, whether they sell the debt or hold onto the debt also changes the terms and the risk level that they're willing to work with. So, if a bank holds on to the note themselves, then they have much higher risk if that person defaults, as opposed to, we're going to sell this debt to someone else. We're going to take our cut from setting this up in the first place, but we don't have the exposure of all the payments down the line. Somebody else does. we're the finances and is so up, it's so shady.

[00:53:04]
AcquiMatch Team: But this is what makes all this work, you know?

[00:53:08]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): It's an amazing program. It's an amazing program. the reason why it exists is it's trying to make it easier for individuals to also become wealth independent, right? To create wealth. So it's trying to level playing field for the little guy. And that's why, you know, but the programs now, Pete private equity and investors and et cetera able to capitalize on it because they give a searcher their equity check. And then that searcher is is taking the personal guarantee on the business. The risk to the investors that, you know, they might not get their principal back, but like it's a highly leveraged, but they're getting the benefit of the dividends thanks to the SBA loan. So the SBA and, you know, lenders are like being very discerning about who they're allowing. people to bring in investor money in. So if somebody is coming in and putting zero money of their own into the loan, they're less likely to sign that off because they're like, you literally have nothing to lose, you know, you have no asset, like if somebody has no assets or putting zero cash in, unlikely they're going to get signed off by the SBA. It's why I had to raise $3 million on my deal because I didn't have the kind of personal net worth to be able to guarantee the exposure because SBA will only go up to 5 million. I was offering 8 million and then on top of that, they had the 15% exposure on the 5 million from the SBA. So, you know, the way that I overcame that was showing up with money is collateral from investors.

[00:54:51]
AcquiMatch Team: So that's a good point. the pair pursue, they're unreliable for And

[00:55:00]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): No, usually ask for more cash upfront. They'll ask for more down payment or the person doing the parapassoon needs to have the net worth to be able to cover their exposure there or assets in the business. in my case on that deal with it was an it was an airball that was literally no assets. It was a service based business with no assets whatsoever. So there was nothing for the bank to come after the business. Should I be able to stop making payments and then I don't have the net worth for them to make up the three million plus the 15% of the five million like no way. Like we take my little Prius, you know, but with my background, I was able to overcome the like, are you capable of running this business? But I still had to show up with three million dollars worth of investor money, which only 1.5 was being applied to the down payment. Another 1.5 they wanted sitting in a certificate of deposit is collateral against their downside. Which knowing what I do now, I would have structured, I so mad about that. like did the numbers later and I was like, I gotta offer 10 million and done everything and so frustrating, but okay, so I know we're running a little bit over, but just in terms of so something that came up when we were talking with Jason, I think it's a really good point of saying like, hey, Jason, there's a lot more risk to you now that you're not going to be the due diligence, but in post L.O.I. we want to be really specific with the clients about when the renegotiation points are, because what can happen is that there's significant deal fatigue if the seller's going through due diligence and that every time something comes up, Jason's going over there and renegotiating a point, renegotiating a point, renegotiating a point. So what we need to do is get our clients to keep their cards close to their chest, start writing a list of all of these things that come up, right? Unless there's like an absolute deal. killer that comes up like something that's like, this is this is going to kill the deal and we have to talk about it. But if it's deal adjustment or a risk adjustment, right, we don't want to have that conversation now, we want to go like, as long as it's not a deal killer and the client's still like, no, want to keep moving forward, then we need to start strategizing with them in terms of like, well, let's get a list of all the things that you want to have another discussion about, working capital, purchase price, seller to reduce the risk, indemnification and reps and warranties, like, all of these things are going to have to have another discussion. But if Jason does it one at a time, every time, like, he'll kill the deal. So, and he'll want to do that, right? They will want to have this discussion every time something comes up and like, even the renegotiation of the purchase price, he's like, well, what price would you offer? And it's like, we're not there yet. So, you're making a very good point tone, but it's like, we need to be evaluating this. And then decide point at which we go back and do a renegotiation, right? And that's when we go and meet them in person. By this point, we've spent weeks, if not months with them, going through due diligence, building rapport, trying to get an idea of everything that's going on in the business so that we can have a list and we can decide what's the most important things that we need to change, what are the things that would be nice to have, what are deal breakers, what are things that we can bring up that are leveraged but we don't actually need to change but it just helps our case in terms of getting the bigger points agreed to. So we can make concessions on these things we don't care about that much in order to get the new agreed at a bigger point. So it allows us a much better negotiation strategy to only do one or two max like renegotiation discussions. So I know Ryan, you've heard me say this before but I'm also seeing it for the benefit of David and Luke in terms of what happens during this process. But Brian will have the fun job of trying to keep the clients from doing the negotiations prematurely.

[00:59:12]
AcquiMatch Team: Yeah, this is like, I mean, all this stuff is helpful, know, for you guys too, because it helps you understand at the top of the funnel, what happens at the end of funnel and everything to account for it. So, yeah, and these conversations, everything is talking about because she went, you know, got really far on her deal and went through a lot to get there, like, there's a lot of things here that, you know, even if you work at a brokerage, don't fully understand all these things unless you actually get above the deal yourself. So, it's all really good stuff.

[00:59:50]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Yeah, and, you know, for my time in the contrarian community being a facilitator there, it's like, I've been witness and involved in so many deals now that... And I, every time one of these things came up, like, oh, oh, so I'm just a collector of all this experience too. Best practice, that sort of thing. you know, one of the things that's really important to us as a business is we scale is making sure that none of us become the only knowledge expert in the business. Because that makes a risk for us, right? And it also doesn't help us grow and expand. I'm like, oh, , I have all of this knowledge in my head. need it. So, that's, you know, why we do these sessions, that's why I have you guys come on buyers club. It's as much as I can do to get stuff out of my head. And then Ryan's doing the same with you guys, trying to impart knowledge. Because the more that all of us have this knowledge, we can scale a lot quicker. And we're all giving clients the best advice of every point and understanding the process as it goes through, because it all has impact. David or Luke, you might spot things early, that it's like, that's not a decision. discussion pre yellow light, but it certainly is something that post out a lot, we're going to have to dig into that and figure that out, right? now that you guys hear about the landlord leases and all of that kind of thing, it's like, if you spot things in there when when people are like, Oh, doesn't want to give a lease, you know, it's like, well, that's going to be a really big point to negotiate and figure out post L.O.Y. So yeah, even though you guys aren't on the front lines, like Ryan and I are on these deals, it's more Ryan now. Like, what, what dealer are people working on? Which is awesome. I love being in that position that y'all are the ones kind of pushing all these through and making things happen. But sharing that knowledge with each other and like when you learn something about this and sharing it as a team and making sure that there's no one person on the team that's like the only expert in this area. And

[01:02:00]
AcquiMatch Team: you know when when when we started it was me and I was like oh you know I gotta get it get it out of my head like into you all um sorry that was probably longer ramp than it needed to be this is all this is all ammo to Luke for you know like all these things that you're learning like let's say like for instance the sheet metal right like you just throw that question into the broker call and they start taking more seriously right the all these little things just like now your knowledge base is so elevated when you pick up things really quick so it's just like you you you scan the listing you scan the send you pick out these little things as you always pull up our clients you throw them out there and then all of a they're like okay this is a serious person yeah every time I learn a little bit more and make sure it makes your write it's great too right like this videos that you're doing oh you know you're showing off your knowledge and while you're picking things out and that makes the service feel great so customers just want to and watch the video and you're identifying all these things and you're cooking here and you're saying, look at this P&L, look at this list thing, look at this. They're like, I would have met, I'd guaranteed. They're like, I would have never figured this out before. immediately off the go, you're adding value.

[01:03:13]
Luke Gillespie: You're right. And my write-ups get better because I learn things that I can't include in the write-ups.

[01:03:19]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): You're so right. And us teaching David all of this too, because he's at the front lines, the whole thing that people come to us for is like, it's not just the time saving. It's like, they want us to recommend things to them that they wouldn't have necessarily considered themselves. They want the coaching and advisory from us. And they want us to find diamonds in the rough. So that's CGK, CGK business. So I knew two people that looked at it and walked away from it. And I was the one was something that I could cannot get out of my head. I get to the point where y'all are running this business without me and I can start something else, I want to start something like this and hopefully I miss the book because everybody else picked up on it. But the model was something I hadn't seen anywhere. And when I found out, I was like, oh my god, this is an absolute goldmine, right? To the point that 14 other offers were made on this business because other people saw it too. This is like this is insane and there was nothing else like it in the country in terms of the volume and the number of doors that they had that they were making this play. So they want us to find diamonds in the rough and oftentimes the Sims and the listings don't leave a lot to the imagination. These brokers are not marketers, they don't , know, a lot of them are lazy or they don't know how to like write great copy, they're not using chat GPT to like make things engaging or they're not pulling out the right things. it's like, we need to see like early on, I am very loose with with what I'm eliminating like if it's not a franchise and it's within the geography and the financial ranges and not immediate like disqualification on the industry I'm moving it forward because when I told the two of people that ended up becoming investors on that deal had looked at that deal and passed it and they were giving me money and I was the one that was gonna own the business right like and they were like how did I miss that that was like because I see things people don't see and I'm willing to take it further than other people are so you see what our clients do they look at something and they're like no and they're making these assumptions on this business before actually walking it down the line and thinking like well how could this work like is that really a deal killer is a really an opportunity here so the more that we can be those people like finding diamonds in the rough presenting the businesses they would have never considered like that's why I call it acquisition matchmaking right because a matchmaker does those kinds of things. They're like, I know you said you wanted a blonde that was 20 years younger than you, but I found someone that's probably years younger than you that's actually really great match. And you guys have all these things in common. And I think you did like have a blast, you know? And she's not going to make you try to be a dad at 60 years old, you know, like there's just like people want things that aren't necessarily good for them. So we can be those people to like, have fun and be creative with it and be like, you know, you saw what I just did with the Jenny, the RV thing. I'm like, they talked about wanting to be outside all the time and loving to be outside and travel and, you know, being outside, outside, outside. That's all Jenny talked about. I'm like, an RV company, that's perfect, you know? And then you're like, and her husband's really into automotive. So like, those things that we bring to this process are different than what anybody else is doing out there. Good stuff. Cool. So you're good on Jason and next steps and Ryan feel free to like tap on me a lot because I know you're walking down a path you haven't necessarily been this far down before so like as much as you need me to kind of like like we did with the L.O.I. is in the first instance like I'm happy for us to do it outside of these these calls too if you feel like you need it.

[01:07:28]
AcquiMatch Team: And then I'm following the you know the post L.O.I checklist and I'm kind of realizing that it's not as much as following the list as like making sure they're they're maintaining communication with the seller on these topics not just telling them this is the topic go do it. It's like did you do it? What did he say? You know it may take you listening to the communication and coaching them on communication. That's what I'm finding is what they need help with.

[01:08:00]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Yeah, and not letting steam, like not losing steam, not overly pushing them on things that actually aren't that like, know, because they might chase things that it's like, well, why do you think you need that at this point? You know, and like, also, are you talking with the right people at this point? Do we need to start bringing insurance people in to like get an idea of what your costs are going to be there and have you filled out the diligence list? Like, is it using that? Has it even started filling it out? Like, where's the app with that? So that, you know, has he asked everybody for their diligence list and put it into a diligence list? Is there a process that he's following? So a lot of us, like you said, is, is holding them accountable, making sure they're doing the things that can bite them in the later. Also keeping them from having discussions that could end up messing up their deal, right? hold your cards close, start listening down all of the things that you want to renegotiate at some point. And then when you get the full list in front of you after you've walked the whole line with some lenders and like, you know, the lenders of green, green limit, and it looks good, then it's over to QV. I would have insurance take a first look at it, just to make sure there's nothing like glaringly obvious there. But the QV is going to come back with if there's like major issues right with the business. And that's where we retrade if needed and have that discussion, not at this right, because you're going to spook him, we just got him back online, we're not going to be like, so I know you just came back, let's talk about lowering the purchase price, because there's more risk to me, it's like, well, here's my report that, that, you know, and so you're going to have to take a much bigger seller note, which we can do a balloon, but this is going to cover my risk since you're not willing to do all the other things, right? And then he'll have a whole list of all these other things that are issues. And it's like, well, this came up and this came up and this came up and this came up. So it's like, they're like, Oh, , you know, it's like, here's all the problems that I found with your business, but we are coaching Jason. It's like, you bring all that up, but actually have, you know, one or two main things that you're trying to get as an outcome, but listing all of the things that are issues is going to, you know, and then when you make concessions on those, I actually did it with Jason. I use negotiating tactics on him because he was the only person that ever wanted to change our service agreement. And he wanted like some big changes. then one of the things that it was like really important to him was having the agreement be in the state of Georgia. And I was like, honestly, really don't give a  what state it is in. It's not that big of deals since everything's like tele, you know, like you can do stuff like on Zoom. So I gave him that, which made him feel like I was giving in on some points. So then he gave in on his points, which were actually the ones I wanted him to give him. But I held fast on, I was like, it's like the negotiation tactics we can help them do. They won't have, if they, every time something comes up, they're trying to negotiate that point.

[01:11:15]
AcquiMatch Team: Yeah, for sure. I think one of the things with Jason is, because I was able to progress and why I wanted to just at least make the risk was mainly because we kind of has this, if we lean on us for everything and if we say it's going to be fine, well, let's say someone like JB is like, help bring it up. do you think about this? do think about that? And we talk about it. But Jason's kind of like, he's like, look, they said that they'll land up since November, right? And I was like, great. But also, like, I'm not going to say just straight before it, right? It's... Like, I'll make that clear, there's risk here, that way, down the line, you're not blaming us and saying, why didn't you tell me this was risk, you said this was fine, right? So I'm like, let's take the obvious here, we're moving forward, but there's no, the considerable more risk than we mean you dropped, you know, the line. So I had a call to him about that today, and we went with your strategy, which is pretty much we're going to get a QoE, we're going to get a QoE, going to get a Q of A/L and use that in order to reach out to that.

[01:12:32]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Yeah, exactly, good. Cool. Any other major things you want to talk through, right in terms of the deals?

[01:12:41]
AcquiMatch Team: Another major. There are some things for clients I want to talk about, but we may and you can talk about it on her Twitter blog.

[01:12:47]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Awesome. Great. Cool. Good stuff, y'all. How are we feeling overall about deal flow right now?

[01:12:58]
David R: There are a few clients. like J soon and SP, they have a very low deal flow, so I've been trying to chase or hunt some deals for them.
ACTION ITEM: Add BizBuySell searches for Atlanta/Georgia to increase deal flow for SP, Jason, and JG - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/246705840?timestamp=4381.9999 But I talked to Ryan today and we saw an opportunity to maybe change, not change, add a few search in B's by sale and B's quest in order to get more deals in specifically in Atlanta and Georgia. I'm going to try that and see if something changes. But yeah, those three are the main clients that are having some issues with the reflow, SP, Jason and the deal.

[01:13:42]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): And how is the new system working where we're not doing priority clients every week and just processing the deals as they come through?
ACTION ITEM: Implement new deal prioritization based on business quality (high/medium/low) instead of client priority - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/246705840?timestamp=4422.9999

[01:13:52]
Luke Gillespie: That's good. We implemented another prioritization method because it is over learned with sims. So we're just going based on quality of the business rather than prioritizing the clients. it's just high, medium, low, but I guess it's still not perfect. Cause right. already got Andrew to write ups out and some of these other clients, I have nothing for it right now. So, but yeah, we're, we're trying to do that.

[01:14:20]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Oh, trust. You got it. got to get yourselves out of the, like that's David's job now to make sure there's enough deal flow coming into the pipeline. But, um, you know, I was, I was thinking a lot about it. It's like on these clients that have given us such big parameters, we shouldn't be penalizing them in terms of the amount of write ups that they're doing because other people aren't getting enough. So like that, that was, that was explained to them early on, but also it's, it's not looking at my words and the results are not matching up too. If I tell people like, Oh, you gave us so many great, you know, locations.

[01:14:58]
Luke Gillespie: You should have a great deal flow. Yeah.

[01:15:03]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): So I know it's, it's, you know, just, just trying to ramp myself down this week from the adrenaline I was running on the last couple of weeks, trying to get, I'll be able to tell you guys more soon on what it was working on, but like, it literally had to like,
ACTION ITEM: Review Ida's work on RFI-to-SIM conversion rates; apply insights to improve deal sourcing - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/246705840?timestamp=4526.9999 So it will feel uncomfortable to just process the deals as they come and trust, but we're only in the month. So towards the end of the month, we can start panicking if we need to, but, you know, processing the deals as they come and then David, you can tweak and be the one to kind of look and, you know, that work that Ida did with how many, how many RFIs we need to do to be able to get the Sims, like there's some good work that's done that we need to look at more at the beginning of the funnel rather than trying to everybody all run back and forth. because we're just creating bottlenecks, know. Luke, I know you read the goal and Ryan did too, so like it's literally what's happening. Oh, okay, you should. Because it's exactly what's happening in our running back and forth and creating bottlenecks and you know, things stacking up in front of things. Luke knows that concept well enough. So I like this prioritization of the quality of business because that's good because it's like, you know what happens? If we get it, okay, so if somebody has like a bunch of great write-ups, the likelihood of them closing and becoming not a client anymore is higher. So we don't want to keep all the clients on the books all the time either.

[01:16:46]
Luke Gillespie: Yeah.

[01:16:47]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): It's good for them to no longer become clients. We do that by giving them higher volume of good quality businesses and getting them to them early enough that they can move and be competitive.

[01:16:58]
Luke Gillespie: Yeah.

[01:17:00]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Dave and I are coming up. We're just finalizing agreement. don't know how many like I'm sending him over one today. I don't know how many red lines he's going to have on it, but that should open up a nice little pipeline pretty quickly of some off market opportunities for some of our clients. don't think he's in some of our, I don't know if he's lived in Georgia or anything like that, but that will be cool to get access to that. So hopefully he doesn't have a bunch of adjustments that he wants to make the agreement. We can get access to that list soon. Also, then you guys are going to have to take a look at it and figure out who does what on not.

[01:17:44]
AcquiMatch Team: Nice.

[01:17:45]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Well, thanks for staying late.'all. Good work and excited to. There's some good stuff. Oh, is the off market for Andrew?

[01:17:56]
AcquiMatch Team: that going over to him? Yeah, we're Oh, so we are already introduced in everything we're going to, we're setting up book about ourselves.

[01:18:04]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Was he excited?

[01:18:06]
AcquiMatch Team: Yeah, he's a little bit nervous about the price.

[01:18:09]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): It's okay, do that. Like, push him right.

[01:18:12]
AcquiMatch Team: I'd tell him a little bit. So I would love to discuss that with you tomorrow. how is the answer for that?

[01:18:19]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Cool. Nice. That's exciting though. Nice work on that one. I'll go back to my contact to and say we've made an inch or we're making an introduction of things for that. It was actually my sales coach that introduced us to that one.

[01:18:33]
AcquiMatch Team: Cool. Yeah, he entered the ask and I didn't want to say anything. I just said, it's a bit like that team of contacts. Oh, where it came from? Yeah. Yeah. like, how did you find this person? was like, I think that's a contact I love that.

[01:18:50]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Yeah, that's good. But like those kind of little stories and things are good.

[01:18:54]
AcquiMatch Team: It's like we're finding things that nobody else is finding. Yeah, for sure.

[01:20:56]
Athena Simpson (Unrestricted): Cool. Awesome. Cool. right. I'll let you go now. Sorry. I can't. Did you late? Um, thanks y'all. I'm excited.

[01:21:02]
Luke Gillespie: We're doing good stuff. Cool.

[01:21:07]
AcquiMatch Team: Thank you so much.

[01:21:08]
Luke Gillespie: Bye. Thank you.

[01:21:09]
David R: Bye.
