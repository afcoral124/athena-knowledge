TRANSCRIPT - CORRECTED VERSION

Athena Simpson
Hello. Hello, hello. How's it going? That felt better, not doing the presentation in that one, huh?

Charis Siau
Yes, I would agree. Much better. Just kind of like the highlights and opening it up for discussion.

Athena Simpson
Any ideas on how to make it more interactive? felt like, just they're like, yep, I'm like, okay, . I would like this session to be a little bit more like high vibe, high energy.

So if you guys want to think about it, if nothing springs to mind now, we get to do this once a month.

Luke Gillespie
Yeah, it's kind of just based on their energy. I feel like maybe setting the expectations more that it's going to be a collaborative thing because they're showing up.

I'm knowing how I would think if I were them. They're showing up like, oh, I'm just going to be on mute, just listen to Athena do her thing so I don't have to say anything.

But then when you kind of throw it on them and they're not prepared to talk, they're a little shot.

Athena Simpson
Yeah, so maybe the message that Ida sends Anke can be more to that effect. We also got them the video a little later than I would like, so I think we'll get it to them earlier, now that it's done, so that hopefully they'll have some more time to review it.

And then Anke, when it's sent, I think also say, we're going to be covering this in the new client orientation call, so make sure you watch it and write down any questions you have about the process or anything like that, so that they know that we're going to be, you know, the expectation is to watch it, but also they'll have an opportunity to ask questions, to write down anything that doesn't make sense, or that they have questions about it as they go through and watch it, so that we can discuss in the call.

Anke Jordaan
Got it. I'll have Ida update the message that she sends out. Okay, cool.

Athena Simpson
Yeah, I thought the icebreaker might help a bit. I don't know. We'll have to keep iterating on it. want him to feel a little more interactive.

I don't know how to do that.

Luke Gillespie
Yeah, the icebreaker is good. Or maybe not to throw extra responsibility on us, but like have Cash and Charis and I add in some more things and talk more because then it's more collaborative on our side as well.

Athena Simpson
Yeah, what kind of things might you put in there? Yeah, I don't know.

Luke Gillespie
Just jumping in the conversation more. I probably could have said more. Anke even DMed me another option to talk about for problems that the clients ran into.

Could you just put more effort into being more participative?

Athena Simpson
Yeah, maybe in prep for the next one, you each can talk about top tips. You know, like, Charis, you'll have a little bit more experience with the off-market, so maybe top tips on off-market, Luke, with broker calls and, you know, cash, if we can pick out an area for you, maybe, like, overcoming objections or something like that.

Like, if you guys want to think about, like, what's my area that I can, like, carve out some thoughts to give some top tips as I go through this.

And you'll see, like, where they get stuck and that sort of thing, too, so you can kind of pull that realness to it.

Luke Gillespie
Yeah, yeah, that could be a good idea.

Athena Simpson
Cool, we'll keep iterating on it. I think it's fun to, like, do it all together. You know, like, okay, your search is starting rather than just, like, sending a message.

Like, your search starts and, like, letting them sit there for three weeks waiting for a write-up, so.

Charis Siau
I think it's interesting... Oh, sorry, Athena. Yeah. No, go for it. I think an interesting question we might want to ask them too, maybe when they're doing their intros or like a second part to it might be like, you know, what are, what's maybe your biggest fear about doing an acquisition?

Um, and I think that could really help us as the analysts, like kind of watch out for that part and know how to get ahead of that, um, early and could just help kind of like, you know, open up the floor a bit on, on the deal side.

Luke Gillespie
Yeah.

Athena Simpson
Um, I like that. I could tee it up with going first too. That typically helps people. Feel okay to say that kind of thing.

Um, that's true. So like, I can all, I'll think about what my fears were going into it and I can share that.

Um, cause if we just bring it on. And then I'm like, what are your fears? And they'll be like, but if I go first, you know, or like, I'd say you guys, but you're not, you're not necessary.

So yeah, I like, I like that as a question, though. Might be something to pepper in your onboarding or like first calls with the clients to like while you're, while you're, you know, buying time waiting for the write up, because I think it would be good to get those, those weekly calls scheduled sooner than later.

And you can talk about some of those things like, Hey, what should I know about you? What are you afraid of?

Where do you normally get stuck when you're looking at things? Like, you know, what, what thing do you do that if I see you want me to call out on you?

Like, so we can do it in the group session, but also that can be a good way to break the ice and start to get to know them a little bit early on.

Luke Gillespie
Yeah. Yeah, that might take some structuring as well.

Ryan Cash
Cause right now we're not having weekly. having weekly. I think you can schedule them earlier.

Athena Simpson
That was something you wanted to do anyway, Cash, so you don't have to wait for the first one.

Luke Gillespie
Yeah, mean, that also might help just relieve.

Ryan Cash
It is kind of, I can see how it can be like scary for clients kind of going into a vacuum and maybe not hearing anything for like, you know, two or three weeks.

Might help or alleviate a little bit of that as well.

Athena Simpson
Yeah, I think it could be simple too. Like it wouldn't need to be too structured. Like, hey, just wanted to check in so we can start to get to know each other.

You know, tell me a bit more about how you make decisions, what are you afraid of, et cetera. Here's an update on what I'm seeing on your deal flow so far, you know, so if you're seeing it being like super low already, then you can get ahead of it and be like, so it's lower than we'd normally like.

what we'd like to see at this point. And the team can tell you like, you know, David and Ida and everything, like whether it's low or high.

And then that way you can get ahead of it like you wanted to do with Federico. I think by scheduling the calls earlier, doesn't need to be a full hours, 30 minutes.

Like, you know, here's what we're working on. Tell me a bit more about you. I'm seeing low deal flow.

Maybe start thinking about this and then we can revisit it next week.

Ryan Cash
Yeah, no, I think that'd be a great idea.

Athena Simpson
Well, was yours. So I'm just saying yes.

Ryan Cash
Yeah, yeah.

Athena Simpson
We were just waiting for first write-up before because it was me doing the calls and I didn't have, you know, so it was like didn't make sense for me to get on calls with them.

But I think it'll be good for you guys to start to get that relationship trust built. You've already done the onboarding with them and that sort of thing.

So it's like, okay, here's what's happening. We're doing this. I'm seeing healthy deal flow. very well. Tell me a bit more about where you normally get stuck and what scares you.

Okay, cool. I'll let you know if we find anything in the meantime.

Ryan Cash
No, that would help out a lot, especially on those clients that we have some bottlenecks with. Because we probably spent twice the amount of time trying to solve a problem on the back end, whereas all that time would have been saved if we could have just had that call on the second week.

So, yeah, that's awesome.

Athena Simpson
Yeah, as long as they, like, so, you know, it's obviously, like, we want to hit a certain amount of write-ups and that sort of thing.

But like I said to you guys, like, do they have something to sink their teeth into, right? Same thing when the search starts.

ACTION ITEM
Send list of assigned homework for new clients to analysts.
Like, are we keeping them moving? So it's like, hey, you know, have you done any modeling yet? You know, you could just ask them about, like, where have you gotten to with the homework that was assigned to you?

So, Anke, maybe... We get these guys the list of the homework that's been assigned to them. I don't think they even know that.

We assign them a bunch of homework and onboarding. So you can check in like, hey, have you gotten through all that?

Anke Jordaan
Where are you at? What's that?

Athena Simpson
Anke? Sorry, guys.

Anke Jordaan
Froze there for a second.

Athena Simpson
Oh, okay.

Anke Jordaan
Sorry. The last thing I did was get these guys the list of homework.

Athena Simpson
Yeah. I don't think they actually know what has been assigned to the clients. So that'll give you another talking point to keep momentum going, right?

Because what I always like is that the ball's in their court. So as much as we can like lob the ball over to them, even while we're like waiting for write-ups, it's like, have you done your homework?

Okay, what have you done? Okay, now do this, right? So even just asking them, like, what have you done?

Did you have any questions on that? Have you done any modeling? Do the modeling, you know? So it's just like, keep them working on something at all times and then they...

That's perceived value, right? We always want them to feel like they're trying to catch up with us rather than them chasing us.

So if we're lobbying over write-ups and they're not biting on them, the perceived value is going to be lower than less write-ups, but ones that they're excited about.

And or, oh, you don't like that write-up? Let's talk about it. Work on this homework while I go and find something else.

Or rethink your geography or industry, you know, for our next call. So there's always something for them to be doing.

Does that make sense? Cool. Keeps the relationship good, too, because it, like, keeps you in that frame of their guide and telling them what they need to be doing and that sort of thing, as opposed to, you know, them sitting there and wondering what the hell's going on.

It's like, even if we don't have a write-up ready for them, like, do your homework. Think about this. Okay, we have a call.

Like, are you going to buyer's clubs? Why not? So there's plenty that we could be getting them busy on.

Yeah. Good stuff.

Athena Simpson
I was like doing the numbers on the rentals, right? And like buying homes and renting them out, like you can't make money.

Most of our clients tried that and they're here now, right? But I was doing the numbers on like buy, like buy financing an RV, putting a little money down, financing an RV, running it out.

So even with all the taxes, everything, you know, and then like, I was just like, I can't believe how much money we're paying for this RV.

And it was like, not, it wasn't even clean. Like the sheets weren't nice or anything. It was just like, I was like, you could do this so well and make so much money off the, like you get professional photos and put some good linens and like just all the little accoutrements in there.

And like, you could make a killing running RVs and then do little guides of like, you know. These RV parks that are just, you would not get that experience even staying in a hotel.

Charis Siau
It's so true.

Anke Jordaan
my call takes you away from business. I know. In the middle of a forest with a 2007 model RV.

What is it going to take for you to not think about business?

Athena Simpson
I didn't do business all the time. I'm feeling very refreshed, although I did a lot of journaling and stuff on stuff.

But no, yeah, it's an affliction.

Charis Siau
But I see things and I'm like, it could be better.

Athena Simpson
And I know people that have made a fortune off buying RV parks, too. mean, it's just...

Ryan Cash
Yeah, RV parks generate a lot of cash flow.

Athena Simpson
Yeah, it's an interesting model.

Ryan Cash
My cousin and her husband own an RV park in Lindale. And... Oh, they do really well with them.

Athena Simpson
I, I, yeah, I mean, , they're like, we were seeing like 60 to 80 bucks a night. Some of these places have like a hundred spots.

Yeah, it's just like minimum three night stays. And they're just providing water, electricity, and then a shared like bathhouse thing with some laundry that you pay for.

Charis Siau
It's, it's a, it's a really interesting model.

Athena Simpson
Um, but yeah, anyways, glad, glad we all got a long weekend. I'm feeling refreshed. Um, and we're rounding towards the end of the year.

So make sure y'all are looking at your vacation time and getting that scheduled in. Cause like, , I needed it.

Like everybody needs it. And, and I am not, uh, uh, an exception to that. learned, learned my lesson this weekend.

Um, it's fun having my parents. parents. parents. Um, It was a really good, good trip. So let's jump into it.

I had a few things I wanted to talk about, and I saw you guys had some stuff on the agenda, and then I would love an update, so I'm prepped for Buyer's Club, so we'll make sure to leave some time for that.

SCREEN SHARING
Anke started screen sharing
Yeah. Thanks, Anke. Okay, cool. So I know Luke's familiar with this, but Charis and Cash, are you familiar with TAB, the Texas Association of Business Brokers?

Ryan Cash
I'm not, no.

Charis Siau
Lightly. I've heard of it. That's it.

Athena Simpson
So it's, I think, the largest broker association in the country. They're certainly the most active. They do little local meetups.

Cash, there's probably one in Houston. I used to go to the Austin ones, but they also do an annual meeting as well that all the brokers come to, all the lenders come to.

So I would really like to have all of you come out to this year's TAB. It's a two-and-a-half-day thing, and there's a lot of education and learning, but more importantly, really good networking with all the Texas brokers.

So since all of you are now going to have Texas clients, good way for you to interact with them and hopefully get over that issue that we're having when they don't know what we do.

When I went last year, like Wendy got on stage and she's like, they were like, there's no good qualified buyers out there.

Wendy's like, there's more qualified buyers than I know what to do with. She's like, go talk to Athena. And the tide changed from brokers being like, who the are you to like coming over to me?

they're like, I heard you had qualified buyers. And I was like, I do. What kind do you want? I felt like a drug dealer.

So it was, it was a really like pivotal, pivotal shift, you know, and at the time I was only really looking in Austin and Dallas.

So thought it'd be good. If you can all make yourselves available, obviously pay for all of it to get you out there, have you stay there, but also an opportunity for all of us to get together and thought we could do some like team analyst time as well.

So it is coming up in a couple of weeks. It'd be the 25th through the 27th of September. So we've looked up some flights potentially for Charis and Luke, and then Cash, if you wanted to drive or fly, we could make that happen.

If you all can be available, if you have other plans.

Ryan Cash
Did you stay in the city that we're talking about?

Athena Simpson
Is this Austin? Oh, sorry, Dallas. Dallas.

Ryan Cash
Okay. Yeah.

Athena Simpson
Charis just lit up.

Ryan Cash
gets to go home.

Athena Simpson
she's like, I'm from Dallas. So, okay. So, yeah. So, yeah, I think, I think it'd be fun. It'd be good for us all to kind of like show our faces there.

It'd be good. There's some good, going to be some good sessions to learn. Also, it was. It's really pivotal for me.

was just seeing the generational difference between us and the majority of the broker community. But when you're there showing your face at that event, it changes things and they take you seriously.

And we got a lot more traction with the brokers after I went the last time. So I thought it'd be cool to have all you there since you're the ones representing us and be able to make those connections and everything too.

Ryan Cash
And do we have a date? Like when is the next big hootenanny? the 25th through the 27th of September.

Oh, so very soon. Yes.

Luke Gillespie
Sounds fun. Cool.

Charis Siau
Yeah, definitely need to just look at the calendar and do what I can to try to make sure those dates happen.

Athena Simpson
Yeah, so we were thinking and And I And Anke can follow up with you guys directly, but Cash, like I said, if you wanted to drive out there or fly, whatever your preference is, we'll cover the cost.

But I'm going to probably drive out Wednesday night so that I can just work from there Thursday, and then the stuff starts Thursday afternoon and evening.

And then we'll have, like, team time on Saturday, so everybody heading back on Sunday, the 28th. Luke, you kind of lose two days traveling, so we were thinking of potentially having you come out the weekend before, so you can just work from Dallas those days if you're comfortable with that, so we're not losing two whole days.

Charis, you'd lose kind of a half day, or, you know, most of the day on, like, Thursday. The flights we were looking at would have you landing at, like, one in the afternoon, but it'd be a super early flight for you on that Thursday.

So, why don't y'all look at your personal calendars and everything, let us know if we... You can take a weekend away from you.

And then what we'll do on those weekend days is that you can get those days as a day off somewhere else, just as long as we're not all taking it at the same time.

So we'll give that day back to you at another point you can choose.

Charis Siau
Okay. Or two days since it's a Saturday and a Sunday.

Athena Simpson
But yeah, so then we'll just need to strategically get you all to take it at different times so we're not all off on the same days.

But we'll bonus that back to you. So what works for me sounds fun.

Luke Gillespie
Thanks for the invite, Athena. I do want to come. And yeah, I can make my schedule work. Whatever you guys think is the best thing, the timing, whatever is the best, I can make that work.

Athena Simpson
Awesome. Cool. Okay. Charis and Cash, can you have a look and let us know maybe is tomorrow reasonable to let us know if that would work so we can get planning on the travel and everything?

Charis Siau
Yeah, that sounds good. Yeah.

Ryan Cash
I don't see a reason why it wouldn't work. I wouldn't I do need to just double check. I am moving into a new apartment on the first of the month.

So I just need to double check with making sure that there's not anything that I need to do the weekend before.

But I don't see that being an issue. So it should be good. Awesome.

Athena Simpson
Well, we can, you know, maybe bonus the days back to you around the move to help with that.

Ryan Cash
Yeah, no, I'm confident. I just want to double check with my girlfriend before I commit on this.

Athena Simpson
Yeah, absolutely.

Ryan Cash
Yeah, that's a good call.

Athena Simpson
Check with the girlfriend. Awesome. Okay. So then the other thing I wanted to ask or just plant a seed on, we had two off market deals that got pretty far with previous clients that aren't clients anymore.

Yeah. I'm just wondering if we should check in with them and see if they would potentially work for our clients.

So Luke, is Morgan potentially open to HVAC? And do you think that JV HVAC deal?

Luke Gillespie
Yes, he's open to HVAC. Let me double check if he's open to Tampa, though. Yeah, he's not looking in Tampa.

We have a circle, though, drawn out in Orlando, and it almost reaches out to Tampa.

Athena Simpson
So I can ask him about it.

Luke Gillespie
He might be open about it. can temp check it to him. Well, I don't know if it's even available anymore.

Athena Simpson
So that's the thing, like, before we... Yeah, so I don't know what he ended up doing, if he sold it to one of his guys or if he ended up getting a broker listing.

But I'm just thinking of these, like, off-market deals that didn't end up moving forward with our clients.

Luke Gillespie
Yep.

Athena Simpson
That one one That one one one of them. was heartbreaking because it was such a good deal. And then the Skylight business, the Skylight manufacturing business, I was wondering for Michael, Cash, is he interested in manufacturing?

Ryan Cash
Yeah, that's a huge category. What type of company is Skylight? What are they manufacturing?

Athena Simpson
The exterior Skylights. Oh, literally exterior Skylights.

Ryan Cash
Yeah, I think so. mean, we just went through Powerline machinery, which was, I mean, they were more of a distributor.

They were distributing manufactured products, and he was really interested in that. I don't see why specific manufacturing wouldn't be addressed for him.

Uh. Yeah. I think Michael would be really interested in that look. mean, for Michael, it's just like if he sees himself running it and he sees a way to grow the company, like that's kind of his big thing.

So if there's a growth opportunity available, I don't know exactly where their territory areas are, if they have any exclusivity and stuff like that.

But those would be the types of questions that Michael would ask. Yeah, it's a manufacturer, not a distributor. I hear you.

Athena Simpson
Yeah, so the exclusivity, I guess I'm not understanding where that's referring to. They're downstream clients. Okay, so like the clients having exclusivity over their products?

Ryan Cash
Yeah, or areas, territories.

Athena Simpson
I've not heard of that in manufacturing. What does that look like?

Ryan Cash
Yeah, so you've got a company that's manufacturing a product. It sells to clients. You don't know what those clients are doing downstream of that product, right?

Athena Simpson
No, I'm asking to learn from you because I don't understand the exclusivity in a manufacturing concept.

Ryan Cash
So if you can educate me, it's a good learning moment for me. Yeah, well, maybe I don't understand either, and I'm using the wrong context.

So I don't know. What do you think, based on what you know about this deal? And Michael, do you think this is a good fit or not a good fit?

Athena Simpson
Well, the owner is a little difficult. Luke's laughing. The owner sees himself as a CPA and had some real issues realizing that the way he'd kept his financials was not.

Modern and was going to hold up the whole deal. So what our previous client wasn't willing to do was to just get the financials done himself.

Like it was just this like circular thing. So it really needs to be like, it was a million dollar EBITDA business.

Lenders looked at it and they were like, we just need you to go in and get him to modernize his books for the previous year.

And the client wasn't the best at negotiating or relationship building. So I imagine that might've been where the breakdown was because if, if Michael was willing to go in there with a bookkeeper into the office and get on this man's computer and, you know, get the financials put on a QuickBooks, it's a pretty interesting business.

Ryan Cash
Why was Michael the one that you thought of for this deal?

Athena Simpson
Because it's in Atlanta. Oh, this is in Atlanta?

Ryan Cash
Yeah.

Athena Simpson
Yeah. Yeah. And I don't think I manufacturing is a Stephen Pauly, like I didn't see Stephen Pauly in the business, but I see Michael as potentially being in this business and he's so good about relationships.

Like that's something like Wendy, she's like, he's so thoughtful. He remembered I was like on vacation. I think maybe he might get a different reaction out of this owner.

If he was available, I don't know. So we also need to check and see what the status was on it.

But I'm just thinking of these off-market leads that we got that didn't get, it wasn't that the business wasn't good.

It was because the client didn't push through and do what needed to be done. I think a couple thoughts on that.

Ryan Cash
Like one, just being off-market, it's a rare look that we don't get a lot of. And I think just by virtue of that, the fact that we've explored it and know a lot about the story already and what the risks and ways to present it to the client are, I think there's a lot of value.

You know, the time investment that we've put that makes it, there's a lot of value in that too. Like Atlanta is frankly pretty tough.

And I think that a look at giving Michael a good off-market deal in Atlanta would really help the Bolster's deal flow in general.

So for those reasons, I'm for it.

Luke Gillespie
I think either could work for SP as well, Athena. And that was my second question was like, why not the HVAC company for SP unless there's something I'm missing?

Ryan Cash
It looks like on their industry list, they're open to HVAC.

Athena Simpson
So what about licensing? I thought they removed things where they'd have to hold the license or.

Luke Gillespie
Oh, that was before. That was Gil. That was Gil. That hasn't happened, Athena. And Morgan's not afraid of licenses.

Athena Simpson
That's why I thought of Morgan, but I don't, I don't know. I don't see Stephen Pauly in the trades necessarily, unless I'm not seeing something about them that you guys would.

Ryan Cash
I don't know about the trades. I spoke to them about the fact that I was looking at, this isn't something trade or licensing related at all, but I told them that I was looking at a Huth.

I was like, be ready, Stephen Pauly, because I'm looking at a dumpster company in Tampa for you right now.

And they got so excited. They were like cheering. were like, ooh, yeah, dumpsters, like hard assets. Woo, we love it.

Like, we're ready for it. Pauly was like, put me in a dumpster with a hat. I'm ready to go.

And so I was really shocked by that. I kind of said it as like a joke that they were just like, no, we love it.

Like, I got a friend who's doing like dumpsters in Atlanta and they're making so much money doing that. It really like took me off because it kind of wasn't what I would think.

Knowing their backgrounds and just the stuff that we've been putting in front of them since I've been here. So, you know, even though HVAC is completely different, there's licensing involved that gets more complicated.

I don't think the fact that it is like a trade or blue collar related business, I don't think that aspect would be a turnoff to them.

Athena Simpson
Can you just double check on the licensing cash because it's, the owner held the license. So I don't know how he would feel about the personal guarantee.

ACTION ITEM
Contact HVAC/Skylight biz owners. Check availability, status. Report back.
When you're originally looking at the deal, he wasn't going to have to PG it and then the SOP changed.

So check on the licensing thing and then Charis, why don't you get in touch with both these deals, see where they're at, if they're even available.

If they are, then, then we can have an. their chat about which clients it feels like potentially a good fit for.

Charis Siau
Cool. Sounds good. Awesome.

Athena Simpson
And then Anke can get you those and Luke can give you some color because he was around for those also.

But I think it's just checking in. I also like sensitively would like to understand what's happening with the skylight business because I'm not sure that the former client has the integrity to tell us if they move forward without us.

just also know that that's a potential.

Ryan Cash
Yeah. Your client?

Athena Simpson
Yeah, this was a client that I learned a lot on how to choose clients about. And I will never ever choose a client like that again.

I don't want to pepper too much into it, but I Thank But I have a sneaking suspicion that he would happily cut us out of our success fee and try to close on the business.

Charis Siau
So, yeah.

Athena Simpson
He was not a pleasant client to have. So let's hope I, well, Austin's even better than me at choosing people and figuring out if they're buttheads or not.

Charis Siau
But I was, yeah. Yeah. Would you want it, would you like me to make it like clear, like it's from an email from AcquiMatch?

Like, you know, the owner with Skylight will know, right?

Athena Simpson
Or do you want me to like call them? You don't need to do anything nefarious. Yeah. I can't, you'll be able to see on the deal record whether he was better with like email or phone call, but you just play dumb and like, hey, you know, I'm from AcquiMatch.

know things, you know, from Jason's not a client anymore, but from our understanding, you guys weren't able to get anything done.

Curious if you're still, you know, wanting to sell your business. I might have some other clients that would be a

And then he's like, oh, then it's like, oh, , bring it back to us and I'll figure out how to deal with it.

won't make you step in that. But I don't know if he had what it took to pull it off.

Honestly, I think he might maybe made an attempt or whatever. I don't think he did. So, but it was an interesting business.

Seemed like the numbers were good. It was just that stalemate of who would pay for the financials to get done.

And I think for a million dollar, even a manufacturing business, it's worth spending a couple hundred bucks or even a thousand bucks to have somebody go in there and do the books.

you can, you know, and like we already had Tooney look at it. Tooney was like ready to finance it.

Just needed like one year of, because the tax returns all backed up the numbers that this guy said. So it was just a matter of modernizing the books.

Charis Siau
Okay. And play to this guy's ego.

Athena Simpson
Like he. I think what I was trying to get through to our client at the time was like, this man sees himself as a CPA.

Like that's his identity. He's older. So he was a CPA that bought this business. And so to call into question the integrity of his books or his financials is basically calling his whole identity into question, right?

So it needs to be handled sensitively. Like it's so amazing that you have upheld yours. And I was like talking to Wendy and she's like, holy , they stopped using that software like a million years ago.

And so he's, and doesn't have a backup of the computer or anything. just runs his financials on this like ancient software that he learned how to do accounting on.

So like I said, it's not like, it's not there. It's just like modern accounting practices are different. But I think what happened is that this man was made to feel inadequate or like not an expert.

And it, it, it, it. Really soured the relationship and made it kind of contentious rather than collaborative. So just bear that in mind and the way with these gentlemen, especially, like it's one of the things that as women, we don't necessarily put up the defensive shield with them.

Like so you can you can, you know, kind of play to the hey, I heard your CPA. That's so cool.

You bought the business. Like tell me more about that. You know, and then when you get to like to tell their story, they like you and then it's a lot easier to work with them.

So, yeah, I think I think the former client went at it all wrong and kind of competitive, which might have also shut down any collaboration there.

Charis Siau
Yeah, that makes sense. That's it's helpful to know. On the HVAC deal, it was awesome.

Athena Simpson
And the seller was like doing like he was offering to hold the license and do everything. He just he ultimately felt like our client wasn't ready.

And. Our client got cold feet and just kind of had a like whole meltdown around business buying in general, unfortunately.

And like everybody was like this, it was like HVAC 3X growing steadily in existence for 20 years, like solid business, solid owner.

Charis Siau
And everybody was like, this is the deal. It's even like he was obsessed with ice and it was called cool wizards.

We're like, dude, could like set up.

Athena Simpson
I know. It was like, yeah, it was like perfect. And then he just got cold feet. So I don't even know.

I think he said he was going to try to potentially sell it to one of his employees or whatever.

So, yeah, I don't know where that one's at either.

Ryan Cash
How long ago was that?

Athena Simpson
March or April.

Ryan Cash
Okay, so not crazy long. And what about the skylight? How long ago was the skylight deal?

Athena Simpson
Same time frame. Time frame?

Ryan Cash
Yeah.

Athena Simpson
Both of them got under LOI, too. It was really frustrating. It really frustrating. for us.

Ryan Cash
I can also like pulse check Michael on that before we invest in Snapper. want to find out if it's available anyway, you know, it's a lead.

Athena Simpson
So let's not, I would, I would caution about getting their hype set because they'll remember and they'll, they'll ask you about those deals.

So let's, let's see what's what before you let the clients know.

Ryan Cash
I made, I made that mistake early on when I started this business of like, I'm looking at this and they're like, Oh my God, that's really exciting.

ACTION ITEM
Clarify SP's comfort level w/ businesses requiring licenses. Confirm stance.
And then it doesn't come through. And then they get disappointed about something that, you know, they didn't, they, they would have never known about had I not told them too soon in the process.

Ryan Cash
But do you still want to ask me, want me to ask Polly and Steve tomorrow about just their thoughts on licensing?

I guess.

Athena Simpson
Clarify that for your own understanding. I feel like we had a discussion that they didn't want to deal with that.

Right. Because it's a risk if your business is dependent on somebody else. Like your business can't run without the license.

So all of our clients have different comfort levels with that.

Ryan Cash
Yeah, I would say, I mean, most of mine are pretty not as open to licensing opportunities. Yeah.

Athena Simpson
Okay, I got to move us on because y'all have some chats and I also need the update before Buyer's Club.

So Karis, Anke will get you what you need and then Luke can fill in some color there too. Perfect.

Good. Okay, Luke. I have a deal for Justin.

Luke Gillespie
It's actually, I'm going to do a write-up on it. That first and third bullet point are connected to each other.

So it's a digital marketing agency and it's an interesting thing, interesting deal because there's a digital marketing agency and then what we're seeing very often on the market nowadays with these tech companies is the owner of this business is always going into it.

an AI startup. They always have some AI startup that they're passionate about, and that's what they're going to go into.

And so the Sim sold it as there was a digital marketing company, and then there's this new AI startup that he's going to take over.

He's going to sell the digital marketing, move into the AI startup. I get on the call with the broker.

This broker isn't the most put together and knowledgeable on his deals. His Sims aren't exactly the best. And I find out that they're actually still under the same entity, the digital marketing firm and the AI business, the AI startup.

The AI startup is definitely not cash flowing. The digital marketing firm is doing about almost $500K, like $495K SDE in trailing 12 months, June 2024.

The seller is open to selling both of them together or just selling the digital marketing company separated from the AI startup.

So I told the broker, yeah, my buyer is probably not going to want that AI startup, but he would be interested in the digital marketing company.

And the thing is, over the last three years, in 2022, they added back like $500K. 500k as in that was being invested into the AI startup.

so without that 500k ad back, it's negative cash flow in 2022. And then in 2023, cash flow is going to be like 100k without the significant AI investment ad back.

So with the AI investment ad back, the numbers work and it's on a steady growth path doing 500k SD trailing 12 months.

But without those big ad backs, which was in the AI investment company, the cash flow doesn't really work, right?

And so I thought those ad backs would be valid and understandable if the AI startup was another entity, but it's all under the same entity.

So it might be messy once you start separating out what was invested into what, right? So I'm wondering, is this a valid ad back?

Athena Simpson
Like, what are your thoughts? What are you thinking about it? So just so my brain's in the right place, that link for the commercial cleaning is different.

Luke Gillespie
That's a different temperature check I was going to ask you about.

Athena Simpson
Yeah. Okay. So my feelings on digital marketing as a whole, do you remember how I...

Luke Gillespie
This firm is niched into email marketing and serving e-commerce companies.

Athena Simpson
Okay. So their client base is only e-commerce companies?

Luke Gillespie
For the most part. The broker said they have some other types of businesses as well, but mostly e-commerce companies, yes.

Athena Simpson
Okay. Okay, good. And then what was the AI startup?

Luke Gillespie
Oh, it was SEO.

Athena Simpson
But they weren't able to get it to work?

Luke Gillespie
Again, the broker doesn't know that much about this seller and this deal. I asked him if it was cash flow and he said he doesn't know he has to check with the seller.

Yeah, yeah. Okay.

Athena Simpson
So the thing is, you know Justin's back, right? And where he works? Yeah.

Luke Gillespie
The AI lawyer. The AI software for lawyers. Thanks. You It's not just lawyers.

Athena Simpson
Oh, really?

Luke Gillespie
I thought it was just SaaS for lawyers.

Athena Simpson
No, that's one of their client sets. But no, they do. So I can't imagine that Justin wouldn't be interested in an AI component in this business, which means the numbers don't necessarily work.

And there's no way that digital marketing isn't going to be disrupted by AI. So that's always my watch out when we're looking at digital marketing media companies is what are they doing to mitigate AI?

How are they incorporating it? So if the broker doesn't know anything, you can say to Justin, look, it doesn't work.

The numbers don't work with the AI component. Is this for all years?

Luke Gillespie
They actually haven't added anything back for the AI for the last 12 months. Maybe that's just a convenient, they haven't added that back yet, or maybe that investment actually.

Athena Simpson
Okay, so the trailing 12 months, they have half a million in SDE.

Luke Gillespie
Awesome. Okay.

Athena Simpson
So that's what's more important, right? The most recent year. So that's good. So you can say this one we thought was interesting for you, given your background in, he works, you know, the tool is basically for marketing and AI.

Right. Um, so I think it's interesting enough to put in front of him and then just caveat it that the broker's not too up to speed with this stuff.

So it will probably take you getting on the phone with the owner, um, to get to the bottom of like what happened with the AI component of this and how niched they are.

Luke Gillespie
Uh huh. And he told me before he, he did has done, has had his own, um, uh, or not his own, but he's worked in at a marketing firm before he literally said name dropped that, like on our last call that he would be interested in businesses like that.

Athena Simpson
Yeah. So, okay. Yeah, good. That sounds good. Just, just. Let's caveat it that there's some wonkiness with the numbers due to the AI, but because of his background in AI, he might have something to add to this business that the owner didn't, right?

ACTION ITEM
Complete digital marketing agency write-up. Submit to Athena by 4:30PM CDT.
Yeah, exactly. Okay, yeah. So speaking on that, I'm going to do a write-up for this. It's like halfway done.

I mean, Buyer's Club is going to finish at 4 p.m. CDT. I could have the write-up finished on your plate by 4.30 p.m.

CDT. Obviously, I want to get this to him as soon as possible so he can review it before our call tomorrow and we can talk about it.

So yeah, just giving you a heads up on that.

Athena Simpson
Great. All right.

Luke Gillespie
Then that BizQuest link, I just wanted to temperature check this deal. It looks pretty big. Is it something you would want to look at for Justin?

This should take two seconds. If you just click on the link, Anke, we just see the numbers. It's like a $3.8 million cash flow, $20 million asking price, commercial cleaning, Fort Worth at this size.

they are. You're going to have an operator in place, right? Operators and managers, executive team already in place. Just look at that.

So what do we think about this? Or, wait, actually, too bad it's not in a month for my new client, Kyle.

But yeah, what do you think about this for Justin? So it's in Dallas? Yep.

Athena Simpson
So how do you see that working location-wise?

Luke Gillespie
Well, given a business of this size, we don't have the sim yet. David just pushed this like yesterday. The size of the business, look at that headline at the bottom, executive team and project managers in place.

These size businesses, often they always have big management teams and operators in place. So the location is normally a better fit for businesses of this size.

Athena Simpson
So his specific feedback was unless there's an absolute clear line, thought process, remote already in place, that he doesn't want to look at something far away.

Luke Gillespie
So it was something this size. He's going to have to go private debt.

Athena Simpson
And if the current seller isn't remote, then they're not going to want him to do that. So you can inquire on it, but like all of your questions should be about, is the current owner active in the business?

they on site ever? If the answer is yes, then it's not a good fit for him.

Luke Gillespie
Okay. All right. Yeah. And I wasn't trying to ask about location, just kind of size and numbers here. Is this too big?

Well, the location is the first thing, right?

Athena Simpson
Because that was a big piece of feedback from Justin is that we keep putting things in front of him that wouldn't work location wise, and he's not willing to go away from his family.

So that should be the first thing that we're vetting is, can we overcome the location issue? And we're not putting anything in front of him that's outside of his preferred area, unless there is an absent owner not currently going in the business, or it's a remote business.

Luke Gillespie
Uh huh. huh. Exactly.

Athena Simpson
Yeah, so I would say probably not on that one.

Luke Gillespie
Okay, but if that were located in Austin, is the size okay?

Athena Simpson
Yeah, we, and we, you know, like he has a good relationship with a private debt guys already, so, and I think he's, of our clients, one of the competent ones to be able to do something like that.

So I wouldn't be afraid of putting something like that in front of him.

Luke Gillespie
All right, sounds good. Thanks. Cool.

Athena Simpson
Charis. Okay, so the matchmaker that responded to you on your LinkedIn. Yeah. She said that her revenue is not at 1 million, you know, based on the first three questions that we had sent over for qualification.

Charis Siau
Out of curiosity, I did like shoot her an email, like asking about her net profit, but it was more maybe for your curiosity.

I'm not sure if we would still handle a revenue below a million, but wanted to make sure you were privy on it.

Athena Simpson
Yeah, it depends on, so we just try to do that as like some ways to like filter what would potentially have the size that we're looking at.

But, you know, it depends on, she's got a couple team members. So I would look at net profit next, you know, if you're having a conversation, it's just like, we're just trying to open up the conversation.

Yeah, those questions were again to try to save time because we just didn't have team bandwidth to get on the call with everybody.

But my preference is like, let's talk with everybody because even if it's not a fit for us, especially in Austin, I know good brokers that we can make a referral to if it's not a good fit for us.

So see if she's profitable at all. mean, ideally profitable. Also, like she, it looked like she had a team in place, which is great if she's not the one doing all the matchmaking herself.

But yeah, I have a broker that deals with like, actually Joshua Carnes, who's the vice president of TAB and highly influential for us.

He likes the kind of messy ones. All right. I need a whistle snap tour of what's going on with the clients from y'all.

And what would be helpful for me to talk through with them on the call today?

Anke Jordaan
Especially the ones that you said they were going to join the call.

Ryan Cash
Yeah. So for me, MW, Michael's going to be on the call. He's deep into, I wouldn't say deep at all.

He's, we've got two deals in front of him. One of them, Moonclerk, is a fintech SaaS payment platform. He spoke with the owner on Friday, really likes the company.

Um, he's working to get on a call with the CTO this week. Um, yeah, he could definitely use just some support as he's approaching the LOI process.

Um, you know, this is my first time going from like start to finish with a client. And yeah, I think he could definitely just use a little bit of love and guidance on that.

ACTION ITEM
Send pre-LOI doc to Michael. Instruct review before next call.
Yeah, out of all my clients, Michael's probably the one that probably could use a little bit more guidance on what he's working through.

Athena Simpson
Has he been sent the pre-LOI document that we have for clients?

Ryan Cash
I don't know. I only saw that for the first time today. Okay. Yeah, so that's a good one to get in front of them, to just have them read through that too, so they can start to get an idea of what the process is.

Athena Simpson
And this is for everybody, Luke included. If a client's starting to feel like they want to get an LOI together, here's a document, read this, make sure you understand what our recommended steps are, and we'll talk about it on our next call.

Or you can talk about it on Buyer's Club or whatever. We'll just help them kind of know what's coming rather than drink it through a fire hose.

As if... If one of us are just, you know, me or you guys are telling him what to do on that call.

So that's awesome, though. So he, I can do that.

Ryan Cash
Okay, sorry. I'm taking our time.

Athena Simpson
So what about SP? Okay.

Ryan Cash
So they've got a lot that they've, they've got a lot of deal flow right now that we've gotten their way.

We haven't gotten an update on Bambiz. The way that our call left last week on their weekly was that Polly was going to call the broker and ask if they could explore their own lending solutions versus being trapped in this 30% down payment that Quiet Light was asking for.

So we have not gotten an update since our weekly call Wednesday on whether she's had that conversation. And if so, what the direction was.

I know based off Slack, they're also exploring the crypto newsletter deal. Steve was supposed to speak to. That broke her on Friday.

Falcon Deal's also in front of them, but they haven't given me an answer on talking to the owner or not, so they've got a lot to work with.

I do just want to, before Federico, it's probably going to be the first buyer's club that he will actually attend.

He normally has to go pick up his daughter during this time, but his daughter took off and played hooky today to spend the day with dad, so he might actually even have a daughter.

There with him, but he's got a couple deals that he's working through. Nothing he's really excited about, but he's got a great attitude, and he's going through the steps to get experience and get reps on him.

Athena Simpson
Okay. Is that landscaping irrigation company? That's the one from, through Stefan?

Ryan Cash
No, different one. This one is in El Paso. Stefan is supposed to get back to me sometime this week.

If he doesn't get back by mid this week, I'll make sure to. to touch and make sure he sends that information over.

Athena Simpson
Okay. So it's not that he doesn't like the industry. It's just, he doesn't like this specific deal.

Ryan Cash
It's in El Paso, which is nine hours away. And yeah, he's totally open to going through the steps with this as a learning process.

He was just like, Ryan, more, I think about it. El Paso is nine hours away and I just can't see myself doing it, but he was like, I'm going to go through this.

I'm going to talk to the broker and I'm going to get the reps in. So I think he's got a good attitude.

Okay.

Athena Simpson
Great. Cool. Luke, do you want to fire through yours real quick?

Luke Gillespie
Okay. JG, the hair salon in Austin that he had found out last week from the broker and seller that it's not as absentee as they mentioned, and they really misrepresented the deal.

He told the broker, Hey, the numbers just aren't working for me. I can't make it work. The broker got back to him and said, the sellers really like you.

They think you're the right buyer. They want you and they want to figure out how. Yeah. We can make this work.

So Justin's just been thinking about that, about how to make that work, right? So Anke and I directed him, hey, can you join Buyers Club and talk about it today?

He has a W-2 meeting at 3.30 p.m. CDT. So he's only going to be there for the first 30 minutes.

So you should probably make this P1 and start talking to him about this deal.

Athena Simpson
He shared his spreadsheet model as well.

Luke Gillespie
So if you want to ask him to pull up a spreadsheet and start looking at the model, look at the numbers, can do that.

But yeah, he's just trying to find a way to make the numbers work for him is pretty much that one.

But yeah, the seller is really like him. Broker said the sellers think he's the right buyer and they're asking what it would take.

So yeah, that's kind of where we are at that one.

Athena Simpson
Okay, cool. Charis, round me off with Gil real quick and then we'll jump on to Buyers Club.

Charis Siau
Yep. Okay. So Gil is working on a new deal. It's called 4x4 North America. He has a seller call this Thursday, September 5.

Athena Simpson
He leaves for travel the week after. So he's trying to move quick on this.

Charis Siau
He has some question on his financial modeling template, and it's mostly around ad backs. And then on the section with like working capital and inventory, he's not sure whether to include inventory or not include that.

And yeah, he's trying to work on putting together an LOI so that if the seller call goes well, he can submit that in.

Athena Simpson
What is the deal? 4x4 North America.

Charis Siau
So they're the only crash-tested pet cage transportation. They're like a distributor of this pet cage for transportation. Okay, cool.

Athena Simpson
All right, awesome. Well, it looks like there's some good stuff to talk through. So start with JG, then Michael if he's around, and then Gil, depending on who joins.

Um, anyone else urgent that I'm not thinking of? yeah. Yeah.

Luke Gillespie
Not on my side. Not on my end.

Charis Siau
All right.

Athena Simpson
Thanks, guys. This is awesome. And well done on getting all the write-ups out. It was really fun to come back and seeing all the write-ups that are going to clients and the traction that's been going on.

So it feels like you all are getting into a groove and it's awesome to see. So thank you for that.

I'm excited to have stuff to talk about today on Buyer's Club. Thank you. All right. I'll see you all in a minute.

Thank you. All right. Bye. Bye.
