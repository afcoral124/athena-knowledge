[00:00:00]

Polly: hello. 

Athena: Hey, Gil. And how are you? 

Polly: Good, how are you doing? Steve's uh, on a call right now. He's gonna try to jump on a little bit later. No worries. 

Athena: Great to catch up with you all. Um, excited to hear. I think both of you have some updates.

So that's what today is gonna be. We've got a bit of a small group today, so that's cool. Um, been giving the team some of their time back to process deals, so they're kind of hearing in the background listening in, but not necessarily camera on. So, um, Gil, let's start with you. You've got a signed LOI; tell us about it.

Gil: I did, and I got mine, um, got it on Sunday morning. Uh, but I saw that it was signed on Thursday. So I don't know why the delay, but it's just three days. Um, been spending the past, uh, two days talking to banks, um, [00:01:00] seeing where I can, uh, get some loans. So two of the banks are from, uh, recommendations from the broker.

Um, talking to them, uh, through your connections, and then Wendy from, from, from Live Oak. So I talked to Wendy just half an hour ago, an hour ago. Um, and, uh, she plugged in the numbers right away and she said it looked good. But, uh, there's still a lot, there's still a lot of road to go, but, uh, that's where I'm at.

I'm collecting information, collecting information, collecting information. Tomorrow, uh, morning is my kickoff with the broker and the seller. Great. Uh, I have a whole bunch of stuff that I need to get, uh, said in that meeting. Um, and that's about it. 

Athena: Cool. What are you planning on covering in the meeting? 

Gil: Oh, uh, I need, uh, schedule a onsite visit.

[00:02:00] Um, I need to schedule, uh, a time, uh, and day for weekly meetings. Uh, I want to, uh, get, I, I need their up-to-date 2025 financials. Um, uh, also the financials that, uh, this broker did, he had a, he had a deal room and all, everything was uploaded in there, but you can't download it. Oh, 

Athena: yeah. Yeah. 

Gil: What else do I need?

Uh, there's also one thing that all the banks were worried about, and that's the customer concentration. Uh, so I need from her, uh, a sales by customer list, um, so I can see what's going on. Uh, those are the immediate things that I need. Um, but uh, yeah, that's, that list is just growing. Great. 

Athena: Um, I would. So one of their biggest concerns was securing financing.

So I think that's good to let them know like, Hey, [00:03:00] this is the paperwork I need initially, and then I'm gonna be building out my DD list. So that's that big document that you have. Um, so starting to compile, and one of the things you can do is, um, like have the master one available. Make a copy of that and just delete everything and only put in the things that you need from, you know, that the lenders are asking for so far.

And then you select all the boxes in SBA, and you can say this is gonna be an evolving document, but this is a document that I'm planning on using with you all to start collecting due diligence. Um, so we're gonna start with the stuff that the lenders are needing, and then I'm working with my team to start compiling the complete list so you don't.

Then that way you know, everything from that master list, you can consult with the, you know, different people, pull it over as needed rather than like hitting 'em with the whole list and then being like, oh my God, there's like [00:04:00] hundreds of things. Are these even necessary? Does that make sense? Yeah, it makes 

Gil: perfect sense.

I can do that. Not a problem. 

Athena: Because then it looks very organized. It's very clear. You can teach them how to use it, right? So it's like, I'm gonna give you access to this. You can drop the links in here. I'm gonna be marking the things that are priority, so you know, priority for me. Excuse me, I'm gonna sneeze.

So, um, but then that way you can kind of get them learning your system on, on like small bites rather than just hitting 'em with the whole list and just letting 'em know it's evolving.

But like, then that way the priority system, you know, they start learning. It's like just focus on the high priority stuff. Um, so then, you know, what I wanna do is make sure I can secure, um, confident funding for, because that's what the broker's gonna care about, [00:05:00] right? Right. Seller, probably not so much.

She'll wanna meet you, get to know you, that whole thing. But since a broker's on the call, he's gonna be concerned with financing. Um, so just be like, you know, here's the first things that the lenders are asking about. So I need that so that I can get you all confidence that we'll be able to finance the deal.

Gil: Most definitely. Um, one question about the due diligence list. Uh, on top of each tab is a link to a folder that's, uh, I think that is, uh, an AcquiMatch folder. Should I reroute those links to a folder in my G Drive? Yep. Alright, I'll do that. 

Athena: Yeah. Anke, do you wanna give some, Anke built that fantastic due diligence list, so she's better, better placed to answer that question.

Anke: Uh, yeah, Gil. Exactly right. So, uh, the link to the AcquiMatch folder is just a preview of the structure that you can set up. So the idea is to build that structure in your own drive. [00:06:00] Dropbox, Google Drive, OneDrive, whichever you use. Yeah. Build that structure and then link those drive folders to your new sheet, which you made a copy of.

Gil: Perfect. I'll do that. Um, Anke while I have you. Congratulations. I, I saw your little notes in the thing. So good for you. 

Anke: Thanks Gil. Uh, 

Gil: and, uh, Athena. I saw, uh, Lindsay and Kevin yesterday on the, uh, yeah. On, uh, Acquiring Minds. Interesting. 

Athena: So cool. Right? Um. I, I had a long chat with Lindsay last night too, so just they're, they're deep into ownership on both the businesses, which is really cool.

Um, cool. Yeah. Um, just one thing on the DD list, while we're still here, I think one of the most important but overlooked parts about that is the naming convention on the documents. So that's really what you wanna convey to the seller is that when they send you documents on the list, just be like, I [00:07:00] don't care the overall title, but just make sure if it's your, you know, year to date.

Uh, profit and loss statement, then you name it A1.1 or whatever that line is. Yeah, because that's one of the things that ends up being the most confusing during the process is 'cause there's like 5 million names for profit and loss statement. Um, and also whether it's cash or accrual, this and that and the other.

So like using that naming convention and teaching them how to do that. It's like, this is how you get a document checked off the list. Just name it, put it in this folder. You don't necessarily, sometimes they get confused. It depends on how tech savvy they are about adding the link to the folder. So you can do that as long as they're naming it.

The right things so that you can correlate it to that and then everyone on your deal team also, it makes their lives easier because they can just scan that list, go and look for that document in in the folders. Does that make sense? 

Gil: Yeah, that makes perfect sense. I can do that. I can walk 'em through that.

I'll show my screen and I'll walk 'em through that. [00:08:00] Awesome. 

Athena: Yeah. Um, very cool. Okay, cool. Yeah, Lindsay and Kevin, uh, also great to hear them on Acquiring Minds. So we're gonna be doing a webinar with, um, Will in a couple weeks too, which I'm pretty excited about. Cool. Yeah. Awesome. So I think that's a great plan for the call.

Is this the first time you're gonna be speaking with the seller since the last time you spoke to her? 

Gil: Yeah, she was, uh, the, the broker really played defensive, like he didn't, he didn't let me talk to her at all. Um, so I'm looking forward to that. And, uh, it's Wednesday morning, so I'm, hopefully, I, I, I don't know if she told Tina that she's selling or not.

Uh, so I wanna do a site visit. I don't know if that's gonna be on the weekend. That's gonna be a Friday. That's gonna, you know, when, when she, when is she available? She can say that I'm a IT consultant coming in. Uh, I, I, I don't know. We'll see when I can actually get down there and, uh, talk to her. 

Athena: Great. So I might start off the meeting, do doing something kind of similar like [00:09:00] you did with the broker, with the seller, um, like.

Set the stage, your excitement, uh, just be like, gosh, this process must have been pretty overwhelming for you, haw. Like, I really appreciate you trusting me, um, as your choice, you know, that sort of thing before you get into the business of the meeting. Um, yeah, just to break the ice and reestablish that rapport that you built with her the initial time.

Mm-hmm. Um, so just, yeah, I'd do a bit of chit chat, like, how's this been for you? I bet this is pretty overwhelming on your side. Um, you know, really appreciate you choosing me. You know, what are you excited about in this process? Like, get her talking about like the, the why she's doing this again before you launch into the, okay, and in order to do this, I need to do dah, dah, dah, dah, dah.

And then as you're going through the, like, you know, hey, you know, the site visit, that'll give us some time to get to know each other, need to get to know the business a little bit more, um, you know, so that I can go and talk to the lenders and secure financing. So when you ask for those things, I like to give them context [00:10:00] as to what's in it for them.

Um, so that's another like thing to just make them more motivated to, to tell you or to do those sorts of things, right? Yeah. Um, so. You, you take this feedback really well and it seems to go great when you do it in the meeting. So I wanted to give you some of those nuggets too, 'cause it's been some time since you've talked to her.

So you'll wanna like reestablish the connection. The broker might also, you know, take control and be like, okay, here's what we're here to talk about. But I would still, like, even if he does that, I'd be like, what's, what's her name? Pat. Pat, like, Hey Pat, so great to see you again. Really appreciate you choosing me.

I bet this process was a little bit stressful and overwhelming on your side. Yeah, yeah. You know, it's like, well, I, I want us to work really well together. That's really important to me that we have a good relationship. So some of the things I'm gonna be asking for, so we can establish that while we're going through this process, and I know it's gonna feel intense for both of us, but I just want this.

I want you to know, I want this to be, you know, the start of a [00:11:00] really long, meaningful, collaborative relationship. You know, something like that. 

Gil: I understand. Yeah. That, that, that's, that's a good pointers. I can definitely do that. 

Athena: Cool. I'm excited for you. Let us know how it goes. So tomorrow is the meeting, is that gonna be before or after our chat?

Gil: Uh, it is before I believe. Great. My meeting with them is at 10 and with you at 1130, so, yeah. 

Athena: Great. Okay, cool. So we can chat next steps and everything after that. 

Gil: Yeah, most definitely. 

Athena: Exciting. Congratulations again. It's very cool. I love, I love the idea of this business for you, so I hope everything checks out when you go see it and get to get, to get under the hood.

Gil: Yeah, me too. 

Athena: Um, also Tuni, uh, who I introduced you to is one of the lenders on, uh, Lindsay and Kevin's second deals. So he's been great to work with. 

Gil: I chatted with him earlier today, so Great this morning. Yeah. 

Athena: Awesome. 

Gil: Yeah, 

Athena: he's super like I just. Very problem solver kinda, and just like not really [00:12:00] phased by stuff.

So he just, he just kind of gets it done. He's also a real estate broker. I don't know if he talked to you about that. Um, but very much into like entrepreneur, um, endeavors and just loves talking about business and stuff too. So he's actually local in Austin. I've been, you know, going to meetups with him for the local, for business brokers, associations and stuff.

So also a great strategist in terms of business. 

Gil: Okay. That's good to know. Um, I, I, I've been talking to five different banks and five different people and they each want different things. Yeah. So I have an Excel sheet going on, going with who needs what, when they need it by, when they ask for what outta, what context would come out of.

So the, the PM in me is coming out and, uh, starting to, uh, put all, put everything together into one sheet. 

Athena: Yeah, Jared is one of the highest volume lenders out there. He is pretty like famous in the ETA world. He always wears a cowboy hat everywhere he goes. Um, but he's been doing this for a really long [00:13:00] time and like a very, uh, I wanna say gentle, but he's just very calm.

I like that about him. He is just very calm as he goes through this, but very, really knows his stuff so. He's the 

Gil: only one that didn't talk to me. He's the only, that just sent me an email and just gimme this information. And that's a lot. He's, he's asking for a lot of information there, so I'm, I'm trying collect everything.

It's gonna take, it's, it's gonna take a few days, you know, it's. 

Athena: Well, and then the good thing about that is like all the lenders are gonna need that at some point anyway. So if you wanna like pause on sending him that stuff, have the other conversation, see if they get you some term sheets and if you feel good about one of them before you like go through that process with him.

So you can always do that too. Yeah. Okay. Cool. Awesome. Great stuff. Okay, well I'm excited to hear how it goes tomorrow. 

Gil: Yeah, 

Athena: most definitely. Awesome. And Polly, it's good to see you. It sounds like you have a interesting one that you're, you just had a good conversation with. 

Polly: Yeah, [00:14:00] we had a really good conversation with a broker.

So we're gonna be meeting with a seller, um, on a call probably Monday or Tuesday of next week. 

Athena: And which list, give us, give us a bit of context about. Okay, so 

Polly: this is, um, this is a, uh, full service digital agency. Great. It's remote. Um, they do web design, development, branding and content creation, and they have some unique services.

Um, well unique and yet others offer these as well. But, um, they've done a great job building this all out. So they have UI/UX design, web and mobile app development. They do motion design, visual identity, brand strategy, illustration and animation. So they cover a pretty big gambit. Um. The guy is very young.

Um, apparently he's been doing this for about 10 years, but he's kind of at burnout stage. So he's got, I I, he's married, he is got a young family. I think [00:15:00] he has a brand new baby. Um, just wants to do something different in his entrepreneurial life. So, um, the, the numbers look good. Um, we're gonna continue to model them out, have the basics down.

Um. It, it sounds like a great opportunity. We're excited to talk with him. Um, we, Steve had some really good questions and, uh, I think, you know, in the last, with, with this business and then also the water sports business too. We, we had a call with a seller yesterday and that was, that was interesting too.

But I'll continue on with this web, web-based business. So, um. It, it sounds like he's a super sharp guy. I am very excited to talk to him. And, um, it sounds honestly like he's got everybody in place. He has his web developers, he has all of his technical people. He doesn't get involved with the technical piece of it [00:16:00] too much.

He pretty much is the relationship builder. Um, you know, we talked to him about like 40% of the business is actually three big customers. So we were talking a little bit about that and um, how he would, you know, potentially wanna, if he saw himself there another five or 10 years, how he would go about growing the business.

But a lot of it's been word of mouth and primarily word of mouth. But, um, they have some recurring revenue. They have a recurring revenue structure, and then they have, um, like a project based business where it's just per project. And, um, I think overall it looks like it's, it's run quite well, so we're excited to talk to him next week.

Athena: Yeah, I mean, you, you all have always been really interested in content and also is this something potentially your daughter could get 

Polly: involved with? Uh, potentially, yeah. She's, uh, she's working for an events company. It could be something that she's interested [00:17:00] in. And now we have a new college graduate. I don't think she really knows exactly what she wants to do, but she's, she wants maybe in that digital marketing space, and she's really a techie person, so who knows?

Athena: That's cool. 

Polly: Um, 

Athena: yeah, it 

Polly: looks very interesting and, um, great. 

Athena: So it was a broker call, and then the next step is an owner call, or you already had the owner call? 

Polly: No, have not had the owner call yet. We have the owner call with the water sports company down in Florida. 

Athena: Okay. What's the next step on the web dev agency?

And then I'll, I'll dig into that. So 

Polly: that is, that's just really having a call with a seller and de digging deeper and, and finding out. We had some specific questions that, of course, as the broker always says, better, better asked of the seller. So we really wanna just get to know him and, um. Just dig in a little bit deeper with, you know, how he got the, the business started, where he sees it going, and, [00:18:00] you know, just asking a lot of the same questions we've asked of other, um, business owners.

Athena: Great. And is that scheduled yet, or yet to be scheduled? No, 

Polly: he's actually gonna schedule it. Um, the broker is gonna schedule it for either Monday or Tuesday, I think. Um, I think the seller actually is not available for the rest of this week and, uh. So he said the, that he thought he could get 'em on a, on a scheduled call either Monday or Tuesday.

So I'm just waiting to hear back from the broker. 

Athena: Okay, great. Um, and then any idea how competitive it is, how, how much interest is in that one 

Polly: Right now it's been on the market for three weeks and he said that they have not received an offer yet. Hmm. 

Anke: Why do you think that is? 

Polly: Um, I, you know, I don't really know.

Um, I, he, the broker didn't really. He, he didn't really say, and we didn't really ask as to why, but, uh, he said it is a, it is a very fresh deal. [00:19:00] He said, we've had a lot of people look at it, but we haven't actually had an offer made on it. So I'm, I'm not really sure, um, because the numbers do look good. I don't know if there's some hesitancy about 40% of the business coming from a few customers, but.

Uh, that doesn't really scare me too much because there, there are ways of, of outreach to, to bring those numbers a little more balanced or even, you know, just, just different ways of, of doing the, structuring the business on down the road. I think, I think quite frankly, from what the broker has said, and of course I'm sure we'll learn much more from the, the owner, but, um.

From what the broker said, I mean, he's, he's done a great job of building the business and it's been one of those, it, it, I think it's scaled pretty quickly, so, you know, I don't think he's had a lot of time to think about a lot of diversification, so, mm-hmm. 

Athena: And, [00:20:00] um, if you didn't already listen to the, the episode that Gil was referring, Lindsay and Kevin actually bought a traditional media agency and they used forgivable notes to cover the customer concentration thing.

We put that structure together. We offer a little bit over asking, but then it's forgiven based on revenue targets and stuff like that. So we can, in addition to the things you can do down the line with the B business, we can structure it creatively to, you know, account for some of that stuff once you start digging into it.

Polly: Okay. And, um, that's an Acquiring Minds episode, is that. Yeah. 

Athena: Anke, do you wanna drop the link and, um, we'll drop it in the chat here and then we haven't yet announced it in the channel, but we'll announce it in the channel too 'cause, um 

Polly: Okay, great. 

Athena: Both, 

Polly: both of the businesses they bought are ones that we found them.

Athena: Um, so pretty, pretty exciting for them. 

Polly: [00:21:00] That is exciting. Well, I'll list, I'll definitely listen to that. So, and, and I'll, I'll let Steve know as well so he can listen in. Um, I like the podcast. I've listened to. Quite a few episodes of it actually. 

Athena: Yeah. Seriously, I think Will is one of the best things that's happened to this industry.

'cause he is, he is sharing the real stories and the challenges and how people overcame it and Right. Really getting in the weeds with how did you do this? So I, I love that. Um, okay, cool. So it sounds like you're in a good place on the agency. Tell me about the water sports. 

Polly: Water sports was really interesting.

So a very interesting owner. Um, he, he's been doing this since 2010, I believe it is, and, uh, he owns the pro, he owns the property that the business is located and it's on a prime spot. Yeah. [00:22:00] Um, in the, like Destin, Fort Walton area. And, uh, he owns the, he owns the property, he owns obviously the business and he has, it's, it's parasailing, pontoon boats, um, for rental all obviously parasailing is gonna, he's got, um, two guys that do the driving for that.

So he has two boats and then he has, um, some pontoon boats as well as, uh, he rents out jet skis. And, um, it's a good business. What I find to be really interesting is he told us, yeah, if I sell the business, he is like, that's fine, and if I'm don't, that's okay too.

Like, okay. And so, uh, he, he. Sharp guy, totally sharp guy. Very, very nice and very transparent actually. I mean, he, he is a, he was in the Marine, I think he said [00:23:00] he was in the Marines for 10 years, or in the military for 10 years. I'm sorry, I'm confusing on somebody else I know. But, um, in the military for 10 years and got out, started this business, um, worked really hard to build it successful.

You know, he is had a lot of, of, uh, long-term employees and. I think he just loves his life and he's like, if I sell the business, great. If I don't, I can keep doing this for a little while longer. And he wants to add an oyster bar and on the property, which I think is interesting too because. Not sure how that's gonna change the numbers, so it's a little, it's a little wonky.

Right. But we're gonna, you know, we'll continue the conversation a little bit. Steve and I just wanted a, a chance to digest everything with that. And, I don't know, just, it, it, the way he presented it was, it just, he seemed very nonchalant about it. Let's put it that way. [00:24:00] 

Athena: Interesting. Yeah. The oyster bar, like anything restaurant, perishable food, it's usually like a loss leader.

So, and yeah, people that don't understand restaurant businesses or looks don't necessarily know that, which is why so many people start restaurants thinking it's gonna be great. And then finding out the hard way. Something like super perishable. Right. And like seafood especially is like, you have to handle it pretty.

Um, carefully. Yes. So you get people sick, so that's interesting. So what's, what's your feeling on that? What are the next steps, if anything there?

Polly: Um, I think we just need to figure that piece out. Okay. And, and see where he's going with that. He does not have it on his property yet. Something he wants to do and he wants to do it. Preferably, and you know, over this period of [00:25:00] the season, if you will, so the season is March through, like October. He would like to get it off the ground during this peak season if he can, and if not, then he said it can wait till next year.

But he said it's something he really wants to do. Um, he's a likable person. I just dunno how serious he is. That's my feeling about it. I think he, if you did not give him, um, what he wanted, I, I don't think he would care. Let's put it that way. I don't think it's like a big negoti. It's not, it's not a, like, price would not probably be a big negotiation for him.

I just think, you know, you can present it to him. Um, what the, in the asking price. The multiple. Um, I don't have it up in front of me. In fact, I have the web, uh, business over here on the side up in front of me. But the multiple was ridiculous. I mean, it was, it was very high. And, um, you know, [00:26:00] he's, I think he's just seeing what he can get as far as an offer is concerned.

But it makes me wonder if that offer, if you didn't make the right offer, would you just be like, yeah, no. Just keep the business. So that's kind of my feeling on it. I think we just, we just have a few things Steve and I need to go over to see if it's something we just, we we wanna continue to pursue. 

Athena: Yeah, I would maybe, like what's the broker's involvement so far?

Have they been around at all or are they fairly active? 

Polly: Yeah. And um. You know, the, the broker has been very easy to work with and scheduled the meeting pretty quickly. Um, you know, as I answered some of the surface questions, so to speak, and then got this whole meeting with him yesterday, the seller, um, scheduled and so forth, I just think I, I don't know.

I keep coming back to it. I know I'm repeating myself. I just don't [00:27:00] know how serious he is about selling the company. I think he might. It might be a nice idea for him, but I don't think it's anything that he's trying to get out of quickly. Let's put it that way. So 

Athena: what you might do is schedule a call with a broker and ask him about that just because what's going on there, dude?

Like, you know, there's a bunch of like. Costs to us to go through this process. He is talking about implementing new things. It doesn't feel like he's leveling with us, you know? Yeah. See what the person says about it. But yeah, I mean, the owner not being ready and then when they walk through the process, like the valuation consideration not being reasonable, and also once he finds out what the fees are gonna be for like, like I would ask the broker, like, have you talked to him about.

The taxes that he is gonna incur. Have you talked to him about the fees for a lawyer? Does he have a lawyer yet? Like what's, what's his readiness to [00:28:00] actually sell? Mm-hmm. And then also, if it's a seasonal business, what kind of working capital are y'all gonna need to keep it running? Like, you know, 'cause it'll probably close around the time that the busy season is over.

So. Looking at what working capital would be required to keep it running when there's no busy season. Like, did it get any income around that? So, um, seasonal businesses are tough, you know? Yeah. Um, so it, it's, it sounds like it's a good practice, but I would say this one feels. If the seller's not serious or just totally nonchalant about it, then you can end up incurring a lot of costs.

And when they find out what their costs are gonna be mm-hmm of legal, of the tax situation that they're gonna be in after the broker fees, that sort of thing, then they might not, or, you know, have a conversation with a broker, put in an IOI at a price that you would feel comfortable at, not what the [00:29:00] asking price is, and leave it there.

Polly: Okay. Yeah. And you know, it's, it's something that's certainly an area that we enjoy and we have spent a lot of time so we know exactly where he's located, um, where his business is located and, you know, I think it's a, I think it's a, a, a good business, a seasonal part of it is a little concerning to me because you really have to, you have to take that into consideration.

Um. Those, those off months. And I think he goes down to, um, I think he said one manager, maybe one or two employees, like during that off season. Um, but the season, uh, has grown down there, which is, he was talking a little bit about that. It used to be that it was just a few months, you know, during the summer and now it's as early as March now because so many people go down there, um, and live down there too.

So when family comes to visit, you know, they're taking them. Out on these tours and how [00:30:00] offering these things, I wouldn't think the parasailing would be too popular at in March when it's a little chillier. But, you know, the other things would be, you know, like pontooning and, and that kind of thing. So the season has grown a little bit more.

It's from March to like October when it used to be more like, Hmm. Probably May if I, I think he said May and through. August, you know? Mm-hmm. Um, but it's still, it's still seasonal though. 'cause there is a period of time when they're, they're not doing any business. So definitely something to kick into consideration.

But I marked this down as far as the taxes, the fees, the working capital. I made notes of all of that, so we'll talk to the broker about that. 

Athena: Yeah. And then, you know, if you like it, but you're like, we'd only like it if we actually paid a price that we were comfortable with. You can submit an IOI and see where it goes.

Because a seasonal business where he is not really wanting to sell, [00:31:00] um, you know, where the asking price is just like far beyond what it should be. Then that's kind of a, you know, you're like, here's, here's what we'd be willing to do. Take it or leave it. You know, because he's kind of doing the same thing.

Anke: Mm-hmm. 

Athena: You know? Yeah. The other after time and like with a real potential offer on the table, maybe he'll consider it differently, but I'd level with the broker and be like, Hey, we're not feeling very confident that this guy wants to go anywhere. What's your, you know, 

Polly: and once again, the restaurant piece of it, that oyster bar.

So is that. Gonna be run separately. Yeah. I mean, is it something, you know, he's gonna, he's gonna be involved in solely, that will be his, and it doesn't have anything to do with the actual water sports business. I mean, there's some questions there to be answered, so. Okay. Yeah. 

Athena: So, um, any other deals or questions or things that you've [00:32:00] got going on?

Polly: Um. I know we have our, our, you know, our call with you tomorrow, so we'll, we'll go over the, um, dysphagia, the Swallow Safe business with you. I think we're, we're thinking probably no on that just because of all the things we covered, but anyway. Well, um, we don't have to, I know, I know you know that based on what everything we went over with you last week, so, you know, as far as.

It's an interesting business, but I think she's trying to put a valuation on, on, on intellectual property, if you will. Right. You know? 

Anke: Yeah. She's 

Polly: trying to put the valuation on that when there's, there's no trademark, there's no patent, there's no, you know. So 

Athena: revenue. You know, it's one thing if she had a [00:33:00] li like licensing revenue or correct revenue, like coming in specifically for the IP.

But you know, if it was so easy to do, why hasn't she done it? So, right. It's one of those many things that we see sellers try to do is sell you on the potential. Right? Or they probably got a hard kick in the butt when they thought their business was. Far more valuable than what it actually was. And it's like clinging to these, you know, clutching at straws basically of, of, you know, where they think value might be because the, the, the money they thought they were gonna get retirement or from a sale is not actually there.

So, um, but yeah, if they haven't proven the revenue model around the IP, then it's basically like a theory. Mm-hmm. Yeah. So good, good stuff. Sounds like you're getting some good, good reps in and, um, the, the agency business sounds really [00:34:00] interesting 'cause I know is, like, from our initial conversations, you all have been very interested in content and, um, you know, writing, potentially getting your daughters involved.

This sounds like maybe it has the workings to be able to do that. In addition to, you know, Steve being able to do. Sales and, you know, talk with clients mm-hmm. And that sort of thing. So in your operational background. So, sounds like an interesting one. 

Polly: Yeah, I think it, I think it really is. And I'm, I'm, uh, Steve and I are excited to talk to the owner next week, so hopefully we'll get that scheduled on Monday or Tuesday and we'll be able to.

Report back. 

Athena: Awesome. Great, Polly. Well good to catch up. I will see you all tomorrow as well for our catch up. Um, and then just some heads up for y'all: no Buyer's Club on Thursday.

We will be hosting Buyer's Club next week at the normal times; client meetings all the same. We'll be announcing the guests for next Thursday soon. We've got asks out to a couple people, so we're just confirming timings around that too. So, um, all exciting stuff [00:36:00] happening. 

Polly: 

Athena: Also, some slight adjustments to the template have been made to kind of clean up the real estate side of things.

We're gonna be adding some more features there also. But, um, if you're doing any modeling, just make a fresh copy of the template. Use that also, Gil the um. Lenders love to see when you do the modeling, so you can actually like, send them the modeling that you're doing. It, it, it's pretty impressive to them, um, that they see that you're do going to that level to determine your, your purchase price and everything too.

So feel free to, you know, send your workings over to them. Um, I just use the newest model just to make sure that everything's cleaned up in there from the real estate. Real estate perspective. [00:39:00] Um, it was a little confusing the way it was added in before. So that's all cleaned up. We're adding some new features to it also to be able to like, um, do seller notes on, on the real estate if you wanted to do that, that sort of thing.

'cause that's come up in some of the deals. So, um, so yeah. Uh, always, always evolving that. But if there's any features or anything that you guys wanna see in there, 'cause you, like, we get so creative with the deals. It's like I want every feature in the spreadsheet to be able to account for every of act actuality.

So, um, little hard to accomplish, but we're trying. 

Polly: No, great. Thank you for constantly up upgrade, upgrading the model because, uh. The, the easier it becomes to use. And I know you still have to put a lot of thought into it, obviously, and, and making sure that you're doing it correctly. But for someone who's never really been a numbers person like myself as far as plugging numbers in it makes it actually pretty easy.

And I'm, I'm [00:40:00] training myself, um, on the P&Ls, looking at them very closely because. In the small business that I worked in for so long and, and past ones, I never got really involved on the financial side. So not, that's something that I never really looked at. I. So this is new to me, but I'm learning.

Athena: That's great. I mean, that's, that's the thing that's so cool about buying a business, I think, is that you, you're kind of forced to learn financials on a level that, like most of us probably never looked at before. The, the current owner of the businesses that you're looking at. I don't know how to do this kind of modeling or, you know, debt service coverage ratio, none of that stuff, right?

You just look at kind of P&Ls and maybe your balance sheet, but your accountant kind of does that. So like to, to understand the financials better than the owner themselves like. Um, like Lindsay and Kevin, the media business that, that they bought, there was a pretty complicated way that they billed clients and then they would do, uh, media buys on behalf of the [00:41:00] clients.

And then it was a gross profit thing and the owners didn't understand their own books and Lindsay and Kevin got to grips so that because they had to go to seven different lenders and like defend it. Understand it now, Lindsay's doing the books because she understands it so well, so mm-hmm. It's kind of cool to force yourself to learn this stuff because then when you actually take over the business, you understand it probably better than the owner ever did.

Polly: Yeah. Yeah, definitely. Well, 

Athena: but I'm glad to hear it's, it's plugin. I'm trying to make it a very complicated thing, as simple as possible with plugging in the numbers. And I've got some ideas how to make it even easier. So that's what we keep trying to do is just like, can we do a little toggle thing? Like do you wanna apply the seller note to the, if you're gonna do a 504.

Also just adding in features, but trying to make it easy. And then, um, got some plans potentially down the line to make it even easier. But, um. I'm, I'm glad it's helpful. 

Polly: Yeah, definitely. It's definitely helpful and, [00:42:00] and then uh, each time I do it, it gets a little easier and just because I know what I'm looking for, you know?

Yes. 

Athena: Very 

Polly: cool. 

Athena: Awesome. Well, good stuff. Uh, have a great rest of your day. We'll see you all tomorrow. 

Polly: Okay, sounds good. Thanks. Bye.
