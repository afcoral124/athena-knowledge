Athena (AcquiMatch): Awesome. I think there’s a few more folks rolling in, but we’re recording this for the folks watching back too. Super excited for this conversation today. He’s incredibly supportive of the searcher community, has a really amazing and interesting background, and has also acquired two businesses. He has varying levels of excitement about those. We’re going to talk about that and his process. He’s been really, uh, you know, really grateful that he’s willing to have a real conversation because I think it’s important to learn everything leading up to it, but also hearing from folks that have been through it and are in it and have those personal guarantees on two different businesses.

So what we’re gonna do today is a little bit different. Rather than having him do a presentation, I’m going to be asking him some questions kind of on the journey. But this is also for you all to ask your burning questions of somebody that’s acquired and things that come up. So I want this to be a lively discussion and everything too. So feel free, if you have something to interject, throw up the raise hand or just jump in, but I’ve got a few questions to kick us off. So first of all, Mike, hello, and thank you so much for joining us. If you could kick us off, maybe give us a quick background on pre-searcher life, because I think a lot of folks here are going to resonate with where you started before you even started searching.

[00:03:00]
Mike (Guest): Oh wow, that makes me, that just makes me wistful of like, it feels like it was forever ago. Um, pre-searcher life, let’s see. I actually had no idea what to do with my life for most, for like, I think until I was 25. And then I, uh, I just started like working with my dad ‘cause that was easy. He was an entrepreneur, very successful, a medical doctor, and it was fun. I was like, I get to work with my dad. I never got to really see him before, he was working.

Then sadly he died. He just woke up and had a heart attack and died. And that really was an inflection point in my life because my favorite person in the world— but I had to figure out what to do with his companies and then with the next part of my life, because that whole part of my identity had been gone because he owned medical clinics. Um, that wasn’t really something I could legally own in New York. And, you know, of course, in hindsight, it’s probably all these different—but my goal was like, okay, I gotta get an exit for this so I can get as much money found as possible and figure out what’s next. And so I ended up selling the company, but not for very much. And looking back, I realized all the things I could have released. So those things just kind of haunt me.

And then I was like, alright, well, I’m going to get into working somewhere. And, um, I didn’t realize how hard that would be. And I started working for software companies, like B2B software companies. And I found that was like—kind of played into my natural abilities of being able to just talk endlessly. Um, and, uh, it worked and I did pretty well for a while. And then eventually I, I, uh, I got laid off. Um, and I was pretty pissed off about that. And then I came across the idea of acquiring a business.

Now, after what had happened with my dad’s companies, I was really kind of risk averse. I was like, I’m scared to do this again, to fail again, you know, it just feels so—it feels like such an indictment of yourself when things don’t go well, um, which is not necessarily true, but, um, I did it anyway. And, uh, yeah, so let me know where you want to go from there.

[00:05:00]
Athena (AcquiMatch): Yeah, love it. Okay, so just a caveat too for the folks watching. So Mike’s video might freeze a little bit, but the audio is coming through. It might be a connectivity thing, but we heard you loud and clear, so you’re all good there. Um, but that’s what I think is really interesting about Mike is like, you know, he has kind of a similar journey. Uh, you also have an MBA, is that correct? I’m sorry if you just said that.

Mike (Guest): I do. I mean, it’s not like an institution you would like, you know, like, I don’t know what to gloat about, but it was a good, it was a good degree. I learned a lot.

Athena (AcquiMatch): Yeah. And, you know, the enterprise background and sales and B2B and that sort of stuff. So a lot of folks kind of come from similar realms. Um, so talk me a little bit more of the next steps. Like, how did you discover—what was the tipping point for you that made you realize this was the next thing you needed to do?

[00:06:00]
Mike (Guest): When I first heard about it, it was from like a Cody Sanchez tweet or something. And you know, I was like, that’s interesting, but I kind of just—I don’t know why, even though—so obviously MBA doesn’t prepare you for anything. I think a lot of us can attest to that. I’m going to tell you that if you do buy a business, you’re going to realize that that’s still true. It doesn’t actually help you with anything. Um, and it definitely didn’t teach me like—it taught me about M&A, but, you know, MBA and business degrees, which I have that too, they really teach you like, okay, what would life be like if you were an executive at like a Fortune 500 company? That’s pretty much how they teach you, which is not applicable at all to like most people’s lives.

So that being said, um, I came across Cody Sanchez tweet. She was talking about buying businesses. It’s so easy. Why aren’t you doing this—stupid for not doing this. And I was like, okay, I don’t think it’s possible. Like, you need a lot of capital. I just got laid off. I have money, but like, you know, how do you come up with this money? And then I, as I started researching more and more of her content, um, I never actually paid for anything. I didn’t feel like I needed to, but it sort of got me started. I learned about how the SBA 7(a) program works. And then I started calling a bank. I called one bank. Okay. And, um, this is a big lesson for me.

At the time I called one bank and they made me feel like it wasn’t possible. They were like, you know, if you’re going to buy something, I was—they were like, well, what industry? I’m like, I don’t, I actually don’t know. I don’t have a deal yet. I’m just looking at all these industries. And they’re like, well, if you don’t know what industry, then you probably need a partner with someone who has industry experience. And I was like, well, that’s tough because I don’t know what industry. So what am I supposed to do? Bring on a partner and—if that doesn’t work, find another one, then bring on another partner? Like this is impractical. And so that really—that was like February of 2023. And that really got me discouraged, but I realized—so then I gave up for like a month or two. Okay. And then, um, I like bought a sports car or something. I don’t know why. I got, I got like a new job. I didn’t know what to do with money. And I was like, okay, fine.

And then I started talking to other banks. And that was a key thing I learned, is that you really have to talk to different lenders because they all have different requirements. And some of them are federally mandated requirements. Most of them—I would say a lot of them—are just bank-specific requirements, you know, like, will they lend to you if you don’t have an industry background? The next bank I spoke to was like, yeah, we don’t care. Like you—I was like, you don’t want my resume? They’re like, nah, you don’t have to give us a resume. It’s okay. They really just cared about my own creditworthiness and the deal itself. And, um, you know, it helped that—so then anyway, I started looking at BizBuySell and I came across two companies and like those literally ended up being the two companies I bought.

I mean, I had a process, I had a process before that. I was like, okay, it’s gotta be—I made a spreadsheet. I was like, these are the industries I’m interested in. It’s got to be like this cash flow kind of range and at this multiple. And I would start writing down like the ups and the downside, like how—like I started—one thing I started looking at was how motivated is the seller. Um, and you can kind of glean that from—especially like a public listing, like you can kind of glean that from different ways. Like, are they—do they have really rigid language on there? Like, um, I don’t know, absolutely no seller financing. Well, then they’re probably not that motivated, you know? Um, and, you know, that’s one thing that Cody Sanchez talked about a lot. It’s like finding sellers who are motivated. And that ended up working out really well for me.

[00:09:00]
Athena (AcquiMatch): Amazing. Um, yeah, I mean, we talk about the lender things a lot. We have our, you know, preferred lenders who work really well with our clients, but at the same time, they will fully admit that there’s certain deals that they’re not able to do because they’re super conservative. So some of our clients, in order to get a deal done, had to speak to seven lenders, right, before they found one. So it can be a sales process in itself. So, um, okay, like, cliffhanger—tell us what’s next. Two businesses. Come on. What happened?

[00:10:00]
Mike (Guest): But this is not as exciting as it sounds. Okay. So one thing you’ll hear—I don’t know how many of these you do with people, but I’m sure a lot of you here listen to podcasts like Acquiring Minds or whatever, which I was on. Um, this isn’t like—I’m going to give you the really gritty details of all this stuff, okay? Because I went into this, like—I don’t know, just I guess somewhat recklessly. I just did whatever I wanted. I wasn’t afraid. I was like, yeah, well, I’ll make it work somehow. You know, I kind of had the mindset of like, I don’t know what’s going to be ahead, but I know that I can solve problems. And so whatever those are, I’ll solve them. And that more or less has been true.

But I ended up finding two businesses. One was a garage flooring company that did like, um, polymer coatings on the garage floor. It was like epoxy and those kinds of things, if you’ve ever seen those. For some reason, that’s a big market in Southwest Florida where they have a lot of new homes and retirees. And this company was about—actually like, it was some red flags, but like, for the most part, the guy’s tax returns—like he took home—he filed 420K of income on his tax returns two years straight. So I was like, oh, okay, like that’s pretty hard to fake if you’re going to file that and pay taxes on it. I mean, you could, but probably not, you know? And so, um, and it was being sold for 500K. So me—caveman me—was like, oh, wow. That’s a great multiple.

And, uh, I ended up buying that using an SBA loan—closed June 30th, 2023. At the same time, I was trying to buy a towing company in a different part of Florida, and the towing company didn’t have those kinds of, you know, stellar financials. In fact, you know, the seller was reporting about 40,000 of income, about 250,000 of revenue was just cash that he was putting in his bank account. And this is pretty common for towing companies because they turn over a lot of cash from like impound and stuff when they impound your car. Um, you know, they just—they don’t, I don’t know. They’re all—I feel like they’re all the same. They don’t trust the government. They don’t want to pay taxes. I don’t know.

Wasn’t bankable. And I tried with a lot of banks and they were like—some of them were like, this—we value this at $250,000 and we don’t do loans that low. Some of them were like—one of them said, yeah, we can do this. But then three months into it they said, no, we got a new underwriter and they told us no. Um. And so that was like three months. This was like July. I just closed on the other company and the seller of the towing company was like, oh shit. I think he realized at that point that it wasn’t going to work like the way he wanted. Like if he wanted to sell this, you know, there weren’t just people walking around with a shitload of cash coming out of their ass like, we’re going to buy it—like he had to be creative or something.

So that’s when I said, look, I’m going to make you my best offer. Like, I’m not going to—I don’t want to insult you, but this is the best that I can do. And that ended up being like a hundred thousand down, uh, and 450,000 in seller financing. So like 83 percent seller financing. Not bad. I felt like I got a great fucking deal, which I did, but—but I negotiated poor terms with the seller for repayment. So, um, I would say don’t buy two at once unless they’re like the same industry, same geography, because then it’s additive. When you buy two at once at different industries and different geography, it’s the opposite. It’s like, you know, two plus two equals three. And you end—and, you know, there’s something to be said for focus. Um, so yeah.

[00:14:00]
Athena (AcquiMatch): Okay, so if I were to predict which of the two would be your favorite right now—

Mike (Guest): Wait, hold on.

Athena (AcquiMatch): Okay, so spoiler alert—and that’s the plot twist, right? Like I’m thinking 400K plus on tax returns would be the better business versus the one that wasn’t even financeable. Yeah, you’re buying more towing companies, so like talk us through it. How are they both going?

Mike (Guest): Um, yes, you’re 100 percent right. By the way, I just want to say one thing. I don’t know how many of you have run or bought a business or whatever yet. Sounds like most of you probably haven’t yet. But, um, the best part of all of it is you can wear whatever the hell you want, including this, which I wear every day. And I would wear it—I wear it to the gym. I wear it—hell, I would wear it to a wedding if somebody invited me. Like, there’s no—to me there’s no reason not to wear it. Because the more I wear it, the more like leads I get.

Anyway, um, sorry. So which one’s going better? You’re right. It’s definitely the towing company. And the reason—actually—everything’s simple in hindsight, right? So hindsight makes everything super clear. And it’s like, duh, how did you not see that? So you’re talking about a garage flooring business. The nature of it is that customers are—no repeat customers. Not really. I mean, yeah, every now and then somebody buys a second home or they buy their kid a home or whatever. This is like Naples, Florida. So there’s people—weird people like that. And you know, you might get some repeat business, a lot of word of mouth, but by and large, it’s a one-and-done type of event. And so you’re constantly chasing leads and generating new, new leads. And that is hard and expensive.

The previous owner didn’t really do any advertising. He—I think the way that he did it was purely word of mouth. And I think that the tailwinds of COVID and all the new homes being built and bought in that part of Florida really helped because it turns out that’s a big indicator of who’s going to be a customer. And, um, nonetheless, you know, I wasn’t on the doing jobs like he was. So I knew I had to replace him when I took over, but there was enough SDE there. And the debt service was pretty low. It was like 7,000 a month. Um, that I was like, that’s no problem. You know, I mean, however much I have to spend, it should be fine. Like the debt service is like what, about 84,000 a year. So spend another 80,000. There’s still plenty of cash flow left in theory.

At first it went really well, but a lot of things kind of caught up to me. Number one, um, it’s a skilled trade and hiring skilled workers when you don’t know that trade is hard, especially in something that’s like kind of niche. You know, like it’s hard to—like, how do you vet the quality of someone before they jump on board? It’s kind of hard to do. I hired—wasted a lot of money hiring people that didn’t know what they were doing. You don’t really know that until you see it. And then you book all these customer jobs, keep them busy. And then you have this problem where, like, you either do the customer jobs with the crappy person and then it’s a problem, or you don’t do the customer jobs, but then you lose the customers. Then that happened.

I remember November 2023—we had like the biggest month ever. We did like 120K in revenue, which was like awesome for us, but it was like one of the most stressful times of my life because everything was going wrong. Guys were calling—you know, there’s a lot of like these old retirees who like don’t do anything and they just go around the neighborhood, like, you know, just, I don’t know, like trying to be like the person who like helps everyone in the neighborhood. And those types of people were calling me to complain, ask what happened to the previous owner, all this stuff, you know, and we get a lot of our business from just like these communities giving us word of mouth referral.

So I ended up increasing our marketing spend because I wanted to make sure that we had two full crews ready to work with a full backlog—like at least two or three weeks of backlog. And I was like, that’s the way to make the most money here—is high volume. Um, you know, basically like maximize our capacity. And for some—for various reasons that I can’t figure out, it didn’t work. I think that—I think that the—there’s obviously a part of it, probably execution. I think the market changed because in July of 2023, Florida removed the licensing requirement for this type of work, which I knew about, but I thought it wouldn’t be a big deal, but I think maybe it was a big deal. But I also think maybe that’s why the seller got out of it anyway.

But the—so that’s been problematic to the point where I am now—I’ve now decided to offload it, um, for like basically a fraction of what I bought it for. I think it can be a good company, but it needs someone who’s going to be on the ground at all the customers’ houses, handing out business cards, shaking hands, hobnobbing, whatever, because that type of work draws in a lot of people from the communities and that’s how you can sell. But I was never there because I had another business to tend to.

[00:18:00]
Athena (AcquiMatch): So, uh, just real quick, can you explain why the licensing requirement removal was a problem? I mean, I’m reading new—

Mike (Guest): —competitors to the market. It’s already kind of a small-time—

Athena (AcquiMatch): —so it kind of removed your moat, if there was one that existed already.

Mike (Guest): Yeah.

Athena (AcquiMatch): Um, well, okay. So you’re less than a year into this one. Is that right?

Mike (Guest): No, it was July 2023. So I guess a year and a half and change.

Athena (AcquiMatch): Okay, so you did an SBA loan on it. What does that look like if you’re like, I don’t want to be in this business anymore? And then—and then we’ll switch and talk about the towing one. But I’d love to put a pin in this one—like where you’re at right now. And what does that look like with SBA involved?

[00:19:00]
Mike (Guest): Yeah, um, because not a lot of people will be able to tell you about what happens when you’re struggling to pay debt. Um, I will tell you, everything’s negotiable, number one. Don’t freak out if you end up taking on debt that you’re struggling to pay. Especially when it’s like—a cash-flow-based loan is like pretty much unsecured debt. Like it’s not—like it is because cash flow, you know, if you don’t have adequate cash flow, then what is it really secured by, right? Um, and besides, there’s always like a legal kind of real reality about how things have to work. You know, you can’t just—like a bank can’t just be like, you know what, we’re seizing the assets of your business. That’s not how it works, right? There’s a whole process that has to happen.

But by and large, because of the fact that these loans are mostly unsecured, you can negotiate. They don’t want to take a loss on something, and you don’t want to take a loss on something either—how are you going to pay it? And so I’ve just been in communication with the lender. Like I’m just—and I don’t—like, you know, one thing I used to do in the beginning was I would be like trying to like maintain a sense of like dignity and an air of like, you know, I know what I’m doing here. It’s just that there are these problems that are external. I don’t even do that anymore. I’m just like, Hey, I don’t have money. If you do that, it’s like, you know, we’re just cutting to the chase. I don’t have money. So let’s figure something out. Like, I would need to propose a payment plan to you that will work for me. And—and that’s it. You could ask for all the financials you want. I don’t care. I don’t have it. What I’m going to give you is what I can do.

And you have to really take the “I don’t give a shit” approach. You have to. Because otherwise, the more you care, the more leverage they have, because then they’ll be like, well, I don’t know if we can do that. We have to send it to a team to review it and blah, blah, blah. And you have to like—give us, like, give us your—like, give us all these random documents so that we can see if you’re qualified for a loan modification. I’m like, I’m not doing that. I don’t have money. I don’t have time. Just, like, let’s—let’s do something reasonable here.

And then—I basically—every bank has like a, you know, will assign someone to kind of like an account manager to these kinds of loans, right. And it’s sort of their job to liaise between you and the other departments of the bank. One of which is like a risk mitigation team. And there’s like an account recovery team. There’s all these weird teams they have. Um, and, you know, if I’m not getting what I want from the person I want to get something from, I will just find other people and start talking to them and telling them what I want to do until it goes to the right team who can sign off on it.

And so anyway, I am close to getting extended terms on my SBA loan. How I will pay it: I’m going to sell the company to my sales guy, and he’s going to pay me fully seller financed. I’m not going to sell him the actual entity. I’m going to sell the assets into a new entity so that he’s not directly responsible for the SBA loan. And then, um, I will pay the SBA loan. I don’t know if that’s legal or not. I don’t care. I’m just doing it. Um, and so the bank is reviewing that. Plus I’m going to sell like our trucks and stuff. I went to a subcontractor model. So that’s like easy money they can get for just that stuff. So, um, you have to show them you’re trying to work with them, but, um, if they know that you’re trying to work with them, you know, they’ll usually try to work with you.

[00:20:00]
Athena (AcquiMatch): Wait, wait, wait. But what happens to your credit? Like, are you bankrupt if you have to revise payments? Like, what happens?

Mike (Guest): No. No, no, no. See, don’t—see, that’s the other thing, right? When you take on business loans, yes, you are personally liable, but they don’t just report it to your credit. They don’t. They file a lien against the business. That’s what they do. They want—the business is the main responsible party. Um, and yeah, if you don’t pay after that, then maybe they’ll get a judgment and then that’ll be like reported against you personally, I guess, but it’s primarily filed against the business. Um, I have not had a single impact to my personal credit.

And the truth is I could turn the company around, but I decided that the tradeoff is not worth it because I have another company with way more potential. And so, as I’m trying to buy more towing companies that I showed you, I’d be like, you know what, like, what’s the opportunity cost of me doing this on hard mode? And I wouldn’t have realized that if I didn’t buy two companies. It’s one silver lining of buying two is that I was able to clearly see, okay, one of these is like normal hard and one of these is really hard, and why are they different? And that wouldn’t have been obvious to me if I had just bought the one.

[00:24:00]
Athena (AcquiMatch): Okay, so obviously this is not the ideal situation. We don’t want to be in this scenario, but I think it’s important to talk about worst case, right? Which is kind of the situation that you’re in—the way that you thought it would, debt payments are like—you’re struggling to make them. So what’s coming through here is obviously there’s some more considerations before buying a business that we’re going to talk about that you now know. But also, if you’re in it and things are getting tough, you can work with the lender and work on a payment plan and it’s not going to immediately bankrupt you. But you need tenacity. You need to keep asking for what you need and telling what’s available and working with them to make it happen. So, did I summarize that appropriately?

Mike (Guest): Very well. And you have to take stock of like, okay, what does the business have? Like if you didn’t have the debt, is it still a good business? Or if it’s not a good business, what does it have that’s valuable? You know, and I was ready—oh, I don’t know why—like a month ago, I was ready to like give away the company. And then I talked to a bunch of friends who were like, no, you’re stupid. Like it’s not worth nothing. It has revenue. It has people calling you. You have thousands of customers in your database. You have an online presence that’s phenomenal—like amazing website and processes. Like, what are you talking about? This is worth a lot. It’s not worth—maybe it’s not worth what you paid for it, but it’s worth a lot. Like you can’t just give it away, you idiot.

And so, you know, that’s important to remember. Like you—first of all, I’m not—I’m over being upset about this. I don’t care. Like it’s just—it’s life. It happens. I got to move on. You got to move forward. There’s—everyone talks—and I’m not—I’m not facing bankruptcy, luckily, but I did think about it. Like, what would that look like? Do I have the money for that? How much does that cost? What’s the process look like? You know, it’s not—people act like it’s a fate worse than death—like, you know, devil comes like sucks your soul out and like you’re not even alive anymore, you know? It’s not. It’s really not, if that were to happen. Um, but you know, obviously, I want to avoid that because I want to keep doing this stuff. I want to stay in good standing with—like, you’ll be able to get another SBA loan in the future and stuff like that.

I’m not—one of the reasons I bought the garage flooring company is because I reasoned to myself, okay, $500,000 is a lot of money, but it’s not like that much money, relatively speaking. You know, $7,000 a month is a lot, but it’s not that much. Like I could get a job and pay that, you know? It would suck, but I could—I could do that, you know? One way or another, I’m going to be—there’s always a way. It’s always a way forward. There are—if you have to—in your business, a lot of people who buy companies, and I don’t—I feel like, you know, I don’t know how many people here are like this, but a lot of people buy companies—like me, I didn’t—wasn’t like—I wasn’t like—they didn’t have a ton of cash when I bought my company. I did have some cash, but I didn’t have a ton, you know.

So then the question is how much working capital are you putting on a balance sheet at closing? It’s a huge question. Because that by itself is probably the number one reason why any business doesn’t work. It’s like you’re undercapitalized. As a new owner in a new industry, you won’t know a lot of shit. Doesn’t matter how much due diligence you do or how much you talk to the seller. There’s just so many things you’re gonna have no idea about till you do it. And so the question is, can you weather those mistakes? Because either your business has so much demand that, you know, whatever it is, is behind you and you’re making enough money to not care, or do you have enough money to be able to hire someone to fix things or to pay someone to fix things—whatever it is—but to get to the point where you fix things. And if you don’t, that’s game over.

There are other types of loans you can get, um, which are not good, but they are there. You know, there are the cash-flow-based loans where they take a percentage of your future sales, and these are things that I’ve done. And then I’ve later gone and negotiated those down to like much more reasonable payments. When you’re in a state where things are going downward, it’s war. It’s battle. You don’t care about people’s feelings. Oh, Mr. Supplier, hey, I know I owe you ten grand and you’re not gonna give me any more shit till I pay it, but, um, if you don’t give me more shit, I’m going out of business. You’re not getting anything. So, what do you want to do? You have to be like that. And that’s hard, because you don’t want to be like that. That’s not who I am, really. You know, I—but it just doesn’t matter. It’s like, it’s like, we either do this or there’s nothing for anyone. It’s like for you and me—it’s just sad, you know? Why let it be sadder than it already is? Let’s—let’s fix it. And so I’ve had a lot of good results doing that.

Luckily, I haven’t had to do that as much in the towing company, but I’m starting to because—and it’s not from a place of desperation. It’s from a place of, I need this to be a better business because that’s gonna get me all the other things I want in life. Like, anyway. We can talk about that if you want, but, um, I know, I just—I know I just threw a lot out there and I don’t know if everyone was expecting me to go into these kinds of answers.

Athena (AcquiMatch): No, I love it. I mean, it’s good. You—you know what I’m like. I’m like, I love it. Put it all out on the table and we can dissect it. I have a few more questions and I imagine folks are probably terrified and have some questions on their own. So let’s give the silver linings, right? So like you have—you have a good and a bad and it’s not stopping you from business ownership. In fact, it’s encouraging and you want to do more acquisitions.

So first question—two-part question, and sorry to do this to you, but—so the situation that you have right now with your SBA loan and what you’re going to do, is that going to preclude you from doing future SBA loans, or are you working it out in a way where you’re still going to be good by them?

[00:29:00]
Mike (Guest): That’s the goal.

Athena (AcquiMatch): Yeah.

Mike (Guest): If I—and that’s the thing. Like, if I’m on a payment plan with them that they accept, I’m good. I’m not defaulted. I’m okay. Yeah. Now, is it possible a bank in their underwriting or due diligence on me may inquire about that SBA loan? Yeah, but, um, I don’t know what that means. Like, to me, that’s going to be a question of which lender are you talking to? Because I don’t think it’s—it’s not—there is a question on any SBA application form: Have you ever lost the government money? Right? And if you check that off, good luck, right? But I’m not going to check that off. And so the—you know, is there a bank—there are some lenders that may say, I would like to see the financials of your other companies. Yes, it’s possible. Um, but I’m sure there—I know there are those that won’t ask that. They’ll just want to know if your loan is in good standing or not.

So, hey, it’s not like—it’s like, uh, I don’t know. It’s like if you do something to piss off American Express and like, you’ll never get another American Express card, but like, you can get another type of credit card, you know? That’s kind of how it’s going to be like.

[00:30:00]
Athena (AcquiMatch): Okay. So, um, now silver linings—you’re loving towing. So tell us about that. Why is this the one that you’re really excited about, looking to do more of.

Mike (Guest): Yes, and one more silver lining before I go into that is that I’ve learned a lot, and those mistakes I made will not be repeated. And I did it the hard way—but I don’t know, it’s like I’m a strong believer, you have to learn by being hands-on, by doing it. You know, I don’t think you can learn a lot by just reading about it or talking to people like me.

So the reason I love towing is because unlike garage flooring, almost every towing company has contracts and they get demand every day without you doing anything. And that is night-and-day difference when you’re running a company where you’re managing expenses, making sure you’re servicing your demand, but demand isn’t existential because it’s there. You don’t have to worry about it.

My towing company has a majority of our business coming from Geico roadside assistance. We also do a lot with Allstate, and there’s these things—they call them motor clubs. It’s just like a towing network that you’re a part of and they send calls to you when they have calls in your area. And, um, that’s like 75 percent of our business. We also get calls from people calling us from Google. It’s like, you know, hey, I might want you to tow my car from A to B. And the last part of it is we have municipal contracts with the police. So if somebody is arrested or there’s an accident, we will impound their vehicle until it’s disposed of.

So we—I never had to think about demand generation. It’s just not—the only way you would want to think about that is—honestly, I wouldn’t even—I just wouldn’t even think about it. I would really increase revenue primarily through acquisition. I think that’s the easiest way. Now there are ways to increase demand. Like I just started advertising on Google. For my other company, that was like our primary lead source. For this company, it’s just like a nice to have. I’m like, why not do it? We have capacity. Why not do it? You know? It just totally changes everything. Um, and so yeah, you’re basically just managing costs and making sure you stay compliant because in a company like a towing company, there are a lot of compliance issues. You have like a DOT number, you have a—you know, all kinds of crap like that. Insurance—like you need your insurance and insurance is expensive and if you lose your insurance for any reason, it’s like everyone you ever worked with will get notified and you will never work for them again. So—but that’s like administrative stuff mainly.

[00:32:00]
Athena (AcquiMatch): Okay. Um, I’m loving this. So knowing what you do now, what would you tell your pre-acquisition self?

[00:33:00]
Mike (Guest): Firstly, I would say if you’re gonna buy something, I think there’s not a lot of downside to going bigger. Like, you really should—because you’re going to be stressed. Like, if you get in my situation, you’re going to be super stressed. You might as well be stressed where the stakes are like really worth it. The stakes are like really high. It’s the same amount of stress, um, same amount of effort, you know. The same—it’s like a lot of the motions are exactly the same, except you have fewer management layers in a smaller company. And you have fewer customers and less demand and all those things that make it easy to turn around a business. Because a business can almost always—almost always be turned around if there’s enough revenue and demand. Almost always, right? Um, you just have to do the right things, but you really can’t do that—I’m talking about protecting downside now—you really can’t do that as easily if it’s smaller. Just harder. So go bigger if you can. Um, definitely.

You need some type of seller note. If you don’t have it, it better be like a bang-on opportunity—like something that you, I don’t know, you just can’t miss. But if you fail to get a seller note of some kind, um, there’s always a path forward with, you know, like I said, with lenders. Um, the other thing I would do is I would—I would go for businesses where there’s always some type of repetitiveness to the nature of the customers and the work. You know, like, if you think about other types of home service businesses—like, um—not that I want to do this, but like pool cleaning—that’s an obvious one. It’s recurring revenue. But even something like where you go and like trim people’s trees, for example—like they might not come back every month. Sometimes they have contracts, but they’re going to come back at some point. You don’t have to constantly refill the bucket. Like that’s the hardest part with garage flooring. So, um, that and, uh, what else?

[00:35:00]
Athena (AcquiMatch): Oh, carry on your flow—quick—

Mike (Guest): Just, um, I think I would probably spend more time learning about the industries that I went into—just talk to people, ask them if I can shadow them, ask if I can work for them for free. It just—I was so impatient. I was just like, yeah, let’s do it. Let’s just—let’s do it. I’m ready.

Athena (AcquiMatch): I love that. Um, and I think it’s really important, you know, like—and even be able to shadow the seller. But if you can’t, like, to be able to find other people that do that, get on the phone with them, ask them about it, go to an industry event. Um, really get to know what you’re about to jump into. On the seller note point—you said it’s important to have a seller note. Why do you say that?

[00:36:00]
Mike (Guest): There is—it’s really downside protection. It’s really keeping their interests aligned with yours and downside protection. There are a lot of things sellers can do to fuck things up. And if you have a seller note, you have some recourse. You know, for example, if fraud happens in like, I don’t know, 20 percent of these deals, right? Like, I’m talking like bad fraud, right? It happens—happens a lot. Um, and there’s, um—there’s a possibility that they won’t execute on their seller transition duties. There’s, you know, the possibility that, I don’t know, um, they screwed over their employees and now, you know, everyone’s coming to you saying, hey, that guy promised me bonuses and he didn’t give them to me. He said you would give them to me. You know, all these things could happen. They could start up a competitor and just violate their non-compete.

So it’s—for me, it’s like, if they’re not willing to give a seller note, the deal has to be like really, really good by itself. You can’t—to me they can’t be asking for top dollar and no seller note, uh, unless it’s like, I don’t know what—like the unicorn of deals or something, which I don’t even know what that would look like. But you know what I mean—like, if you’re asking for top dollar, it’s already not a unicorn. It would have to be like a company that has like the best management in place, GM already there, runs everything, and I don’t have to do shit when I walk in the door. Like, if that were to exist—which it doesn’t, it really doesn’t—well, there’s a couple that are close, but like, I’ve never seen one that’s like really like, you don’t have to do anything. Um, then maybe that’s a justification.

So have a seller note because you just don’t know. They have their information asymmetry. They know a lot more than you do. You’re not going to know it till you walk in the door and it’s too late. We hold back until they do their seller transition duties at the very least.

[00:37:00]
Athena (AcquiMatch): Yeah, so that—that was, uh, the conversation that was just being had upstairs. It was a legal panel as part of this searcher event. And it’s like, okay, well, you can use the seller note towards indemnification, right? Which is indemnifying you if there is fraud or any of those things that Mike just listed. If the seller is not willing to take a note—and this is what we try to talk to you all about—is like you need to tell them there’s still going to be an escrow holdback for indemnification. So they’re not going to get all their money at close because you want to at least hold some money aside. It can be in escrow, it can be in a seller note. It’s to their advantage to do it as a seller note because they’re going to get interest on it, as long as they didn’t do anything that that indemnification would need to be pulled from, right?

So it’s like holding back money for one to two years. Um, you know, that five percent equity injection that we try to get y’all to do—that can also be used towards indemnification also. But I really like the way they described it—like, you want to be in the position where they have to sue you. So, if there is fraud involved—which, you know, you’re saying 20 percent, we’ve heard less, you know, and ideally we’ve done our job to and coach people through it so there’s less of that. Um, but let’s say there is—like, that seller’s already written off the seller note because they’re getting whatever they get at the close. So, um, you know. Most of you won’t encounter that situation. And if the seller understands, like, hey, you are going to get paid this amount, but we need to hold some back just in case—like, that’s my protection. Um, you know, and that’s standard to have an—it’s called an escrow holdback, which just goes in escrow and it’s held two years for that indemnification. So it’s another reason why you want to make sure you have a really good deal team behind you and lawyers behind you that understand this sort of stuff in small business land. So they’re building this into your asset purchase agreements. Right? Um, so anyway, sorry, that was a little rant because it’s really important. Like, I would rather see it as a seller note. They get interest on it. You can still use it for the indemnification. Either way, they’re not getting 100 percent of the purchase price at close. Regardless. So that conversation with the seller—

[00:40:00]
Mike (Guest): I mean, with the towing company—I mean, I basically did very little due diligence because I was like, okay, he’s holding the bag on this thing. Really. I mean, I got a hundred K on the line, which is like, okay, whatever. Like it’s not crazy. It’s whatever, I’ll live, you know. He’s got like a lot on the line here. And so I—you know, it just—not saying you should do that, but it—that will make you feel a lot more comfortable with these deals. Because why would they—why would they not? If you have to ask yourself, why are they not doing a seller note? A lot of the times it’s just because they think—maybe they don’t trust you or anyone, but sometimes they just think they’re selling a used car and it’s like, well, just take the car. Like, what do you mean, seller note on the car? You know, just take the car. And it’s not a used car, obviously. It’s like this living, breathing thing that needs—it’s like—I don’t know, this is a terrible example—it’s like it needs to be nurtured. You know, and you don’t know what state you’re getting it in. Um, and you don’t—there’s just so much you don’t know. But you know, it’s hard to have that conversation with people.

I really urge you guys to be—and I know you’re going to help with this, Athena—but I really urge everyone to be like, you know, just don’t—you have to be an optimistic person to do this. And at certain junctures, you have to temper that optimism, and it’s hard. Like, I didn’t do it. That’s why I ended up where I went. But you have to. Because otherwise, you’ll look at something and you’ll see some red flags and you’ll ignore them and you’ll be like, you know what? I don’t care. I can do this. I want to do this. And you might jump into something that maybe you shouldn’t have done.

So, for example, when I met with the garage flooring seller, I didn’t like the guy. I just didn’t like him. I don’t know. It’s just a feeling. I just didn’t like him. And then when I took over the company, he came to me and he was like, alright, so we have this equipment and these weren’t included in the contract, so you have to buy these from me. And I was like, I just fucking closed. If you wanted another 15K, why don’t you just put it in the fucking sales price? Like, what is this shit? And so I’m left in this position where I need him to help transition the company, but he’s trying to hold this over me. And so I gave it to him—which I shouldn’t have.

Now, that’s—that’s the other thing, right? I am no more Mr. Nice Guy. Like, if—I—if you—you know how most of these businesses, how most of these sellers are like, made so much money that they don’t care to say yes to anything they don’t want to say yes to? That’s how I’m becoming. Not that I made all the money or whatever, but just like—it’s just like, you know, you have to—you have to be able to just say no and just be direct with people and have hard conversations. It’s—it’s hard for me. I try to—I avoid those things. I think that’s why I made a lot of mistakes I made.

[00:42:00]
Athena (AcquiMatch): Okay. So actually I’d say most of our clients probably err on the risk aversion side rather than the optimism, right? So everything that they’re hearing from you, I imagine is probably scaring—

Mike (Guest): Sorry. Hey, if you’re not like me, don’t be scared. You’re okay. You don’t have nothing to worry about if you’re not like me. Don’t worry about it.

Athena (AcquiMatch): But I think what’s important to pull out from this—and y’all, if you have questions, I’m kind of nearing the end of mine, so like, I know Mike is so forthcoming and really helpful. Please don’t apologize. This is good. It’s good to hear like different perspectives and stuff. And—and I think having, um, you know, risk aversion is good, but what Mike’s told you—and I’m going to pull out the qualities that are essential as a business owner—is problem solving. And, you know, like, he talked about hard modes—like, every business is going to be hard mode. Right? So it’s problem solving. And what you’re hearing about what he did was tenacity and finding solutions and not taking no for an answer. Right? It’s just like, oh, business is having problems. What we can’t do is freeze. We must move forward and find solutions.

And that is the life as a business owner, regardless of whether you have the kind of not-great things that happened with Mike—on a day-to-day basis as a business owner, you are going to have a roller coaster of things that are happening. And what’s important is we can’t freeze. We must move forward and find solutions. And it’s not going to be perfect. But what is absolutely going to happen if we don’t do anything is the demise, and we don’t want to do that.

So as long as we move forward and try to be finding solutions—and you all are getting to know me well enough, like, I don’t take no for an answer in the kindest way, but when it comes to structuring a deal, if it’s a good deal, there’s a million ways to get a deal done. It’s the same thing with business. There’s a million different ways to do business. But what—the skill set that Mike’s talking about is resilience and tenacity and moving through fear. And I think that’s stuff—I’ve been thinking about this a lot—the fear and how it freezes us. And things we can do, even before buying the business, to desensitize ourselves to the fear and start building up this resilience.

An example from my personal life was I started doing stand-up comedy. And there is no worse thing for most people than to get in front of a room of people trying to be funny and bomb. You know, it’s one of the worst feelings I’ve ever felt in my life. And your body’s like, we’re going to die. We’re going to die. We’re going to die. And then when you don’t die, you’re like, oh. You know, and like, nothing else feels that bad. So something that you can start doing on a daily basis is do something that scares you, right? Like, that doesn’t have a lot of risk and start building up your tolerance to fear. And then the thing that Mike just pointed out too is uncomfortable conversations and negotiating—like, and sales skills.

So regardless of your desire to be a salesperson, when you are the business owner, it is your responsibility to bring in revenue, regardless of who’s on your team. And it is your responsibility to have those difficult conversations when you need to. So how can we start having those difficult conversations earlier on so that when it really matters, we feel comfortable—like, okay, I don’t like these. Nobody likes it, you know, but I know what to do here. And I’ve done this before and my body and my whole nervous system knows I’m not going to die if I have to have a negotiation conversation on payment terms with the bank, right?

[00:46:00]
Mike (Guest): Can I give an example of this really quickly? Super quick. Just—so the seller note I have on my towing company—it’s bad. It’s like four years. I offered this, by the way, he didn’t like offer it to me. I offered it to him—four years, 8 percent. It’s like 15 grand a month. Okay. Like, it’s like way more than half of our cash flow. And, um, it’s really bad. Like I don’t—I like barely have enough money to pay him sometimes.

So this month I was like, Hey, listen, I need a few more days to pay you. I’m sorry, blah, blah, blah. And he’s like a super crabby guy. Immediately he’ll start sending me snotty texts. Like, why does this happen every month? You’ve been like late every time, blah, blah, blah. Like I had—pay him like within a day of the due date, right. Don’t get me wrong. He’s just like one of those guys. And this month I was like—I talked to some friends. I went out—by the way, you should always—don’t get into a space where you’re so stressed that you hole up into like a cave and don’t be in the world, okay? You will not get much out of that. And I was doing that for the last 10 days because of various things that were happening. And I met with some friends for drinks and he was like—and he told me that he’d been through similar stuff.

And basically I decided that I’m going to stop caring about what this guy thinks of me. Forget about trying to maintain a sense of whatever, you know, like dignity. I don’t care. Like, I’m just—and he said, just ignore him. So that’s what I did. I ignored him. And he started sending me all these snotty texts or whatever, and I just ignored him. And eventually what’s gonna happen—he’s gonna call me, and I’m gonna say, Hey, I don’t have money. Um, what do you want to do? And then you make it their problem, right? I’m not trying to tell you what happened. I’m not trying to give you the sob story. Just what happened, right? Like, I don’t have money. And he might throw a fit. You know, if the people—there’s a very common thread. There’s a reason why a lot of sociopaths do well in business. Okay, we all know this, right? I think you know where I’m going with this, right? There is a reason why. It’s because when they need to fire someone, they don’t care. Get the fuck out of here. Go. I don’t care. You thought we were friends. We’re not friends.

You don’t have to be that, but you have to channel that. And I’m doing it, and I’ll tell you what, I feel so much better now that I’m doing that.

[00:48:00]
Athena (AcquiMatch): Uh, you brought up a few really good points there. Um, I—with my business consulting clients, I used to teach them, like, be more narcissist, right? Narcissists rise in power and leadership because they do not care what people think, right? Um, most of our world leaders are narcissists. You kind of need to be when everyone hates you. Uh, not necessarily a good thing, but for those of us that really care what people think, sometimes as business owners, we have to make decisions for the business. Um, and again, like, you know, this isn’t an ideal situation that Mike’s in. It’s not like he went into this not wanting to be able to pay the seller note, et cetera, et cetera.

So, some things to pull out from that is obviously, like, learn your modeling, make sure your debt service coverage is going to work, like prepare for the J-curve—two years—and all of those things. Like the seller note is for four years—that’s going to put you in a crunch when you’re 86 percent levered. So I’m sure, you know, all of these things that we’re teaching you and working with you on—like, Mike would be like, gosh, I wish I did that too, so that I didn’t put myself in a position where like more than half my cash was out the door to the seller.

But I guess the point here is that when things get tough—which they will in some way or another, right? You’re going to have a key customer walk or your key employee is going to demand more money here, not want to work with you anymore—something’s going to happen. It always does. Um, how are you going to react and respond? And sometimes, you know, not caring what people think is what we have to do, but equally taking care of yourself and making sure that you’re nourishing yourself outside of work so that you can show up and be the leader that you need to be for your business and take it forward. Because if you break down, your business will, too. Capture that.

All right, Mike.

Mike (Guest): Yes, I’m going to pick up my son who’s two feet away from me, but I’m right here. Hold on.

[01:00:00]
Athena (AcquiMatch): Okay, cool. Um, does anyone have any questions for Mike? Um, my team might as well. Hey, Joe, how are you? Um, any questions you’d like to ask Mike while we still have him?

Athena (AcquiMatch): Ryan, yeah, go ahead.

[01:01:10]
Ryan (Audience): Thanks so much for sharing. That was awesome.

Mike (Guest): Oh, thank you.

Ryan (Audience): And I’m sure you have tons of towing stories that we’d love to hear as well.

Mike (Guest): Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

Ryan (Audience): But, um, I want—you know, you were—you kind of kept going to the seller note and talking about that and saying your seller note could have been better. It was only four years. You don’t know why you did that. And also about having that note to increase your cash flow or help you out—you know, that’s like a resource you can use. Um, a lot of people that we work with are deciding on how they should structure the note. I want to get your insights on that. Is there any ways now with your experience now, how you would structure the note? Would it be performance based? Would it just be a percentage you’d start with as an offer?

[01:02:00]
Mike (Guest): Performance-based is tricky. Um, but I would always have—well, a couple things. One: as long as possible. Seriously. Like, you can always pay it back early. Like, you know what I mean? Get it as long as possible and the payment as low as possible. Number one.

Number two: make it so that there are—like, what happens if you can’t pay? In my seller note, it’s like, if you don’t pay, you know, within—if you don’t pay right away, you’re already in default. And then if you don’t pay within 10 days, you have to pay a 5 percent late fee. And then if you don’t fix it within 15 days, you’re like—they can demand full payment. You know, they have like a lot of things that are favoring them, right? They can come into my yard and like take their trucks back.

Now listen, I go by the philosophy of legal realism. Okay. And I’m not a lawyer, but—sorry—I’m not a lawyer, but like there’s, you know, there’s a process you have to go through, right? Like, you can’t just like do stuff like that, you know what I mean? Just because it says in the agreement—there’s a process. But I would always have there be some flexibility. Like, you know, what happens if there’s a significant loss of revenue for a period of time? Like, um, what happens if you don’t pay, okay, for whatever—30 days. Are you like immediately in default, or is there like a penalty or something? Or like, you know, just different terms that make—it’s like think about what happens if you reach the first of the month and you’re supposed to pay and you can’t. Do you want that to automatically be defaulted? Because then if you do, then you’re kind of screwed, right? And you’re kind of dealing with what I’m dealing with.

And so, yeah—just get it as long as possible. So one thing you can do, just in practical terms, is let’s say the seller’s—they’re like, I’m 75 years old. I don’t want to do a 10-year seller note. You can say, okay, why don’t we do it, um, like, uh, I don’t know, a three-year seller note, but it amortizes at a 10-year rate. And then there’s a balloon payment after three years. So now your payments are low. You do have to come up with a balloon payment. But at that time, you would be able to get an SBA loan if you needed to for that, or a short-term loan, or who knows—maybe work something else out with the seller. At that point, you should have had some trust with them.

[01:03:00]
Ryan (Audience): So the idea there is to just help you out immediately in the first three years with cash flow until you’re acclimated with the business and you’re familiar and you’re ready for what-ifs. And then once you kind of have a handle on that and you maybe get some growth and you’re feeling confident, then you can do the balloon payment.

Mike (Guest): Exactly. Exactly. And they’re usually like amenable to that because this is not like, you know, they’re not thinking they’ll be dead in three years, you know.

Ryan (Audience): All right. Thank you.

Athena (AcquiMatch): Great question, Ryan. And, um, yeah—getting a really long amortization using that balloon payment. Also, after two years of payments on SBA, you might be able to refinance with like a commercial lender and a much better term on the whole thing if you wanted to, too. So like, two years of good payments on SBA loans opens up a whole lot of, like, capital options for you all. Um, you know, so even if you can’t pay that balloon out of the business, there are refinancing and capital options for you as long as you’ve been on time and running the business at a profit, right? So it’s where you’re running at a loss—where getting additional working capital or lines of credit ends up being crunchy.

Um, so any other questions for Mike or—you know, Mike, we talk at length all the time. Um, what top tips would you leave folks with? You know, they’re getting help on identifying the right businesses for them, we’re helping them with the structuring. Like, what should they be thinking about after transition or like, what top tips would you give people that are like, they’re genuinely going to buy a business—how to prepare for that or things to think about before they buy?

[01:05:00]
Mike (Guest): Well, for one, a lot of people obsess a lot over like, oh, what is the team going to think of me when I take over? I’m sorry, I’m sorry—what is the team going to think about me when I take over? Are they going to respect me? Are they going to think that I’m a joke? I’m sorry—my poor boy. Um, I don’t worry about that. I’m like, most—95 percent of people are really just gonna care that you’re still gonna make their paychecks for them. And if—and you’re not—no matter what you say on day one, they’re not going to trust you till they see that you do that. You put your money where your mouth is and you keep paying them. If they’re due for a raise, you give them a raise. If you tell them there’s an incentive structure for them that you’re putting in place, that you follow through on that and you make it something attainable for them. Um, that’s most of it.

The other thing is, which is something I think you probably handle a lot, is I believe that there’s opportunity in the hairy deals. And I say hairy, I mean the ones where the financials are, you know, not the cleanest or maybe it’s not fully bankable or something—because other people are going to look at those and then walk away because, you know, they’re like, whatever, they’re not—oh my God, I don’t know what this means—if this towing company was hiding $300,000 of cash, just deposit, you know. But that’s common. If you—like, if you look at towing companies, they all do it. Every single one of them does it. Is that me? I don’t do it, but the rest of them all do it. Um, and so would I have walked away from a good company if I was worried about that? Yeah.

And so I know you handle and you advise on that too, but if you just be creative—what’s the best offer you can make, you know, regardless—like, of if it’s SBA or if it’s equipment financing—there’s all sorts of levers you can pull. But if you’re not interested or you’re concerned about it being bankable, every other buyer is too. And so that gives you an advantage if you’re willing to go forward, because, you know, if a buyer wants 5 million for their business, they might just—they do want some cash up front, like a windfall. Maybe they’ll take 2 million and then the rest they’ll finance or they’ll do something with it. Or maybe they’ll sell some equipment or maybe they’ll roll over some equity. There’s a way—I promise there’s a way.

And if I would have paid, you know, market price for my towing company, it probably would have been like, I don’t know, 800–900K. Would have been a lot more, you know, and I’d be like—with an SBA loan that’s way more than what my seller note is. You know what I mean? So there’s—I found opportunity there even though I need to restructure the seller note.

Athena (AcquiMatch): Yeah, I think there’s endless ways to get a deal done. So, um, Mike, it’s been amazing to have this conversation with you. Um, if people want to follow up—Twitter, is that the best place to ask you some questions?

Mike (Guest): Or email me. Um, I can like put it in the chat here.

Athena (AcquiMatch): Awesome. Mike is super active on Twitter. He’s been trying to shout at me for like a year about being more active on Twitter. There’s a big searcher community over there. Um, also, uh, we’ll dig out your Acquiring Minds episode too. I think some folks would be interested in listening in on that and hearing Will’s take on interviewing you here. But, you know, I think it’s so valuable to get the real-deal perspective of somebody that bought and after—and, you know, it’s like, yeah, there’s some scary stuff, but it’s not the absolute worst case scenario. And you’re still encouraged and you’re looking to buy more businesses and you’re enjoying the process.

[00:59:00]
Mike (Guest): And if I had to raise equity for another acquisition, which I might do, I won’t have a shortage of people willing to do it because they—they know that I’ve done this, and yeah, I mean, didn’t go—didn’t go perfectly the first time. So what? That’s life. Own up to it and just—just move on. It’s okay. You’re not gonna die. You—like, if you make it too much of who you—if you make it about who you are—like, this is my identity, who I thought I was—it is now at risk. And I—and I’m—I don’t know, like you feel bad like in that way, like you’re—you’re not going to be cut out for it. You know, you have to separate the business outcome from who you are as a person. It’s not who you are. It’s just—it’s just learning, you know. It’s just life. I mean, don’t get me wrong, I’m stressed a lot. Like, I—I was ready. But it really is a matter of perspective. It really is.

Athena (AcquiMatch): I think that’s such a—thank you for that reminder. I used to, you know, say that to myself enough as a recovering perfectionist, right? It’s like, the results and the business and everything is not—it’s not you. You are able to be different, right? And if things don’t go as planned, if you put your best effort in, it doesn’t mean you’re a bad person, you know. So separating the identity from the outcomes and knowing, like, we’re all trying our best and like, honestly, entrepreneurship—there’s no right way to do it. And there’s nobody that does it without having a lot of battle wounds to go through it. When you’re buying a business, you’re just skipping the zero-to-one and figuring out who your customers are and, you know, that whole thing, but there’s still—you’re still going to get wounds in the process, but it’s a worthwhile one to go through.

So appreciate you being so open and transparent. I’m sure folks might want to follow up with you and ask some questions.

[01:00:00]
Mike (Guest): I put my info in the chat. Just call me, text me anytime. Um, I’m here to help.

Athena (AcquiMatch): Love it. We appreciate it. Anyone else before we jump off—feeling good? Hopefully we’re still encouraged and not terrified.

Mike (Guest): I’m sorry. Oh, you should totally do it. It’s—serious. It’s—it’s—it’s, yeah.

Athena (AcquiMatch): Maybe talk with Mike on your deal before you, like, you know—

Mike (Guest): Listen, I have so many things that I didn’t even share here, okay? But like, if you get into—if you get—there’s so many things you can do if you get into deep shit. Believe me, like, I’ll get you out of it, I promise. My next thing after this is to be a corporate turnaround expert. I’m not even kidding.

Athena (AcquiMatch): Well, one of the things we’ve talked about too is like, you know, in sales training, you do mock calls. So I think it’s really beneficial to have like mock conversations on difficult conversations or negotiating, right? If you’re in an off-market deal and you want to like negotiate with the seller, like either having a mock call with like one of us on the team or saying like, Mike, hey, I’m about to negotiate a seller note. Do you mind if I like have a mock call with you or something? Like, use people in your community and around you to like, just get yourself used to this sort of stuff and have some practice.

Mike (Guest): So you can do that with Chat. You can give them like—yeah, you can be like, hey—you can even like copy and paste the whole text thread with someone, you know, and just be like, hey, I need you to role-play as this other person. And I’m going to ask you questions and respond to them. You could do that, which I didn’t realize till the other day.

Athena (AcquiMatch): Yeah, no, I use it. I use it all the time and I give it prompts. I’m like, respond as this person. So my team called me “the book lady” because I have a book for like literally everything. So then I’ll go into ChatGPT and I’m like, how would this author respond in this situation, you know, about sales or whatever. So it’s a great resource.

Um, amazing. Well, we’ll let you go back to your adorable little one there. Um, thank you so much for your time and insight. Thanks to everyone that joined us today. I’m really excited to hear takeaways and thoughts after this. We’ll be posting the replay along with Mike’s contact detail and his Acquiring Minds episode if you want to check that out. Um, and maybe we’ll have you back for a round two at some point too.

Mike (Guest): Anytime. Yeah. I’d love to give you guys an update and stuff. Like I said, I really do want to help. And I don’t want you guys to feel like you have to—it’s no formalities with me, just text me. I’ll answer. We’ll get on a call, you know—happy to help.

Athena (AcquiMatch): Thank you so much, Mike. Thanks so much.

Mike (Guest): Thanks.

Athena (AcquiMatch): Have a great day, y’all. We’ll see you next week.
