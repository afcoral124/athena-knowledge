Athena: Hello. Hello. Welcome, welcome. We're excited to have this conversation today. I'm so excited for this conversation today. I met Denise's partner, Evelyn, at a searcher event, and then we met pretty soon after that at SMBash.

[00:01:00]
Athena: Right? I think we were the three women that were actually attendees. That's right. At that event. So yes. Denise and Evelyn bought a business about two years ago. Is it now?

Denise: Entering year three. Last month. So, yes.

Athena: Amazing. So I met them and they started telling me about their story and it was just absolutely fascinating. But what was more fascinating was their mindset and how they approach things. And you'll get a sense of Denise's energy today. She's just absolutely infectious in her positivity and her resiliency and the way that she looks at things. And man, they have gone through what would break most people. So, I'm really excited that she's here and willing to share their story. She said no topics are off topics, so we're gonna go through that journey with her and I, I can tell you that there is a happy ending at the end, so white knuckle through it with us. But Denise, before we get into the white knuckle part, give us an intro on you and the business you bought.

Denise: Yes, absolutely. So, thank you, Athena. And as Athena mentioned, we started our journey about three years ago, so that's where I'll start. Both Evelyn and I were federal employees, W-2s, for over a decade. And we really loved our jobs as public servants, but we also knew that we wanted more. We knew that we truly wanted something that was ours. And so a little bit of background on my family. My dad immigrated here from Mexico and once he became a citizen, he opened up his own construction business. Same with Evelyn's mom. And she now has a very extensive real estate portfolio. We're from Los Angeles, and so Evelyn and I knew that we always wanted to go down the entrepreneur route, but we just didn't know how.

So about four years ago, my friend acquired a yoga studio in Dallas, Texas, and they hired me to do operations because that's what I was doing in my previous job. So she hired me and when I got involved, I started, you know, taking notes on staff and all of the operational processes needed and what needed to get done in order for her business to run more effectively. And once I got involved with that, I was like, you could buy a business. And she's like, yeah, there's tons of businesses for sale. And that kind of got our juices going. And so Evelyn bought Buy Then Build and the HBR Guide to Buying a Small Business. And before you knew it, we were searchers.

So we started searching like every bright-eyed searcher in this field, right. They're out there, they're talking to brokers, they're going through SIMs, meeting, you know, sellers. And we did it all and we had a good time while we were doing it. And so about seven months into our search, we had narrowed down to about three businesses we really, really liked, and they were all in the service industry. So we had looked at a commercial tile business, a flooring business, and a lawn and landscape business, and we ended up moving forward with the lawn and landscape business.

So after we— and then we also met all of our team through SMB Twitter. Now, I don't know how many— I don't know how familiar everyone is with SMB Twitter, but that's where we learned a lot of, you know, what to do, what not to do, started meeting these individuals in person. And so we got our attorneys from there, our QoE from there, legal counsel, anything and everything we needed, we went through SMB Twitter and then—

Athena: No. Really quick. No, that's a good intro. And SMB Twitter is kind of a rabbit hole and it's an amazing resource. I've still never figured out how to use it. And I remember, um, Mike Ravi, which I don't know if you know him about the towing business. Like he came on and spoke to the Buyer's Club a little while ago, but I met him at SMBash the first year when we met and he's like, Athena, you need to be on Twitter. And I was like, eh, ah. Like, you know, it was just hard for me. So I am a passive reviewer of it, but there's a super active community and yes, at one time when you were searching, it was like one of the only communities to be able to get information and resources and stuff. So some really great people like SMB Law Group is a massive contributor to the SMB Twitter community, and that's who you ended up using as your lawyers. So, forgive me if I misremembered this, but I feel like your search process was pretty quick. Like you guys— from when you started to search to when you identified and started moving on this one, there wasn't a lot of time.

Denise: No. From when we started to close it was seven months, and that's if you count the month delay of closing. So we started fully searching. And what that means, it's literally after work—again, we had our W-2s—and after work we were at it from 5:00 PM to 9:00 PM like every night for, I wanna say like two and a half solid months until we fully understood the process, because it was a lot. And we did it the old school way where we had to weed out people that didn't wanna talk to us. We had to beg to be let in to places that were already teaching about business buying. It was just a lot. But after two months, we locked in and we closed within those seven months.

Athena: It's wild. I mean, I never hear that kind of timeline. So, you guys went at it hard and that's one of the things that I talk about a lot is like, you know, you need volume. So most everyone here is also in a W-2 or working. So that's why they've engaged us because of the time constraints, right. It's a lot of time, but let's, okay, let's fast forward. You found your lawn and landscaping business, right?

Denise: Yeah.

Athena: And you're like, this is the one. So yes, you hired SMB Law Group, you did a QoE, if I remember correctly. Like you did all the things by the book, right? Everything. So, you know, and you closed quickly. How was the relationship with the seller? Like, was that all good?

Denise: It was great.

Athena: Everything sounded— yeah, it sounded like it was going to plan and the ideal scenario to buy a business.

Denise: It truly felt like that. So we hit it off with the seller. We started communicating with him right away. Now in the grand scheme of things, and I'll get to that, there were some red flags and we'll get to those red flags. But yes, so we hired SMB Law Group, which is, you know, one of the best firms to be represented by. We used Elliott Holland, who is the king of QoE, very thorough in the QoE process. We went through an SBA broker as well, so that we could navigate the SBA world quickly. So we did anything and everything. We followed the book step by step by step, and it truly felt that it was going exactly how we expected it to. Oh yeah. And so we're meeting with the seller. Everything's going great. We're meeting on the weekends, we're seeing all the facilities, he's walking us through all of the contracts. Everything is checking out in the QoE, and then we close. And shortly after closing, we learned that the seller is competing with us. And I'm not just talking doing some side work in landscaping. I'm talking full-on $40,000–$50,000 retaining walls. That was a specialty of the business itself, 'cause we focus on outdoor living. So before I get into that, I'll give you a scope of the business. It had a $2.5 million purchase price and it should have been at $750k in EBITDA. So it was a pretty good sized business. The price was pretty comparable at the time. I do understand that— I mean, everyone I talk to now, things have completely changed in the realm, but that's what it was supposed to be.

And so we're navigating through the first 30 days and within those 30 days we find out that he's competing. We get a phone call from a customer looking for a warranty on a retaining wall that has cracked, and I cannot find her anywhere in the system. And she's like, no, it was Mean Green. And I said, are you sure? Uh, you know, there's several Mean Green. So we are in North Texas and the University of North Texas in Denton goes by the Mean Green. That's their mascot. So there are other Mean Green entities out here. We didn't know that because when we searched the rights of the name, no one had claimed it, so we got it, but there's still other entities operating as that. And I said, ma'am, I know that there's a Mean Green in Arlington, but maybe it was with them. She's like, no, I'll send you over the invoice and I'll send you over the work order. She forwards it to me right away. I see the seller's name on the invoice for $40,000 that she had paid out, and the wall was completed seven days after closing.

And so that felt like the biggest blow as a first-time buyer, as someone that you have created this bond and trust— because that is what happens in the process of buying a business. You do build a relationship with the seller and you believe that what they're saying is true and that they're not going to compete. And another thing, we had what we thought was an ironclad non-compete. 'Cause again, we had some of the best attorneys in this space, and that is when everything started spiraling downhill.

Athena: So she said started, y'all. So this is— and she's dropped some words and things in here to indicate like this is the start. The seller is selling jobs with your logo and your name while you're in the process of closing that he's delivering and getting the money for.

Denise: That's right.

Athena: Like there's no way that he could have just set up shop and made a retaining wall for $40,000 in seven days from closing.

Denise: No— meaning, I'm glad you said that, Athena— meaning the seller always was going to compete with us even though we paid an additional amount for a non-compete. And so from day one, he knew he was going to do this and, and I will say continues to do so, but we'll get to that.

Athena: So, okay, so you're in your first 30 days having done everything right, and you get the gut punch of an invoice from the seller with your company's logo on it for work you didn't do, which is cracking— so like reputational risk there also.

Denise: Right. Exactly.

Athena: And you said this is the start of the spiral. So like what on earth happened next? What else is going on under the hood of this business?

Denise: So, when we acquired the business, the business revenue was an average of about $6.5 million. So we had 50% construction, 20 additional percent landscape installs, and then about 30% maintenance, which is that recurring revenue—mow, blow, edge, all that good stuff. And so once this started happening, I started to get very worried with what the actual business was. If the seller was competing and using our subcontractors— the subcontractors that we are now responsible for and work with— what it really is, the business.

So shortly after that, we reached out to our attorneys immediately, I think that same day. Like I found out and I called Kevin and I said, Kevin, I think our seller's competing with us. I don't know what this means— because you don't expect it to happen— and I don't know what I can do. So he starts pulling up the purchase agreement and we're going through it and he's like, yeah, I mean, let's pursue legal action. Let's go ahead and get you an attorney. Cease and desist, tell him he has got to stop and, you know, we'll continue navigating through this. Okay. So that's happening in the background. 'Cause jokes on me, I still have payroll on Friday, so like I still have to run this business that I've now acquired and I have to really understand what I have.

Well. We started running out of cash really fast. We had about $300,000 in working capital, which the QoE supported— that is how much it took to run the business on a month-to-month basis. And by the end of June of 2023— and we had bought it in May— we had $100,000 in the bank. And it was very scary. You know, you start to worry that the jobs that you're supposed to have, you don't have. Why? 'Cause he's doing them. The customers that were extremely loyal to him are now working with him. The contracts that existed weren't real.

So, second phase, I reach out to my QoE person because it's just not adding up. I'm running outta cash. It's not coming in fast enough. And I'm trying to navigate through this and I'm like, could there have been some manipulation in the numbers that we did not catch? Whether it was in the books, whether it was the banks. So he got to work and he's like, let me see if I see any issues. And he can't find anything. So I'm like, okay, then it's not that. It must be me, it must be the way we're running the business. You know, we're new to this.

And so sure enough, I'm starting to get very familiar with the staff. We're getting comfortable. I'm letting them know, Hey, we're here to support you guys. And they're seeing some changes for the greater good, and that's when things start coming out. So, I'm really empowering my office manager to step into a role that I feel that she could take on, which was a purchaser role. She knew all the financials, she knew what our purchases were, and I really thought that she could handle that. Well, she really appreciated that. And so a lot more information started coming out. And about eight or nine weeks in, she was like, I'm just so happy that we don't have any issues like running payroll— while in the meantime I'm over here panicking that I have $100,000 in the bank when I should have, you know, $300,000 nonstop. And I said, what do you mean? And she's like, yeah, well, with the previous seller, sometimes he'd have to go to the casino so that we can make payroll. And I was like, what do you mean? And she's like, there were so many times where I had to tell the staff that UPS hadn't arrived with the checks and he was essentially going to gamble with some of the business earnings. And then here's where we started finding out the kicker. 'Cause we took on the old QuickBooks— he would create customers and jobs and then inject the business with the winnings of the casino. And so you never were gonna catch it because it was an actual invoice that was getting paid out.

Athena: He was laundering his own money.

Denise: Yeah. To show that the business was working, had a higher revenue, and was profitable.

Athena: Oh my gosh. Okay, so, so that's what you meant by, it was supposed to be $750k in EBITDA—

Denise: $750k in EBITDA, $6.5 million in revenue, and it was not.

Athena: So this isn't something that would be picked up in a QoE? No, because this— real bank transactions, real invoices, real—

Denise: Real invoices, real payments into QuickBooks, QuickBooks processing the payments, applying it into your books. It was real. It was fraud, as you guys can probably imagine. But it was real. And it was really— that was the biggest, most difficult thing to digest because now I knew that this was not at all what we had purchased. From that one. Now, there were a few other things like— in landscape, we work with custom home builders, very high-end custom home builders. And we learned when we were having our builder meetings like, hi, we've acquired the company. We'd love to continue working together. We're committed to providing you with the same service. And then during the meeting, the builder was all, are we still keeping the same agreement? What agreement? The kickback that we get when we give you the job. The what? Mm-hmm. The kickback. Like if I give you a $50,000 job, you give me $7,500 as a kickback.

So just keep going with that same mentality on what that actually means. That means that we were paying for our jobs, of course, but he would pull his personal money from his bank account and pay that out. So it was never recorded. There was never— it's one thing for it to be recorded, like an incentive or, you know what I mean? Like, hey, from these—

Athena: Yeah, yeah. Exactly.

Denise: And that exists, that does exist. 'Cause again, we work with production home builders and with volume we get it at a different rate. But no, it wasn't recorded anywhere. And so I had to stop. I had to stop doing business with these people because I didn't know what kind of deals were happening. And so I didn't know what was real and what wasn't. And I terminated about three custom home builders because the numbers just didn't work out. It almost felt like the business that he had grown was very egocentric, meaning he loved saying, I have a six and a half million dollar business. But the reality is that bottom line didn't support that business. And so as long as he was paying his guys and the materials were paid, he didn't really care about what that bottom line was. And that became very evident very quickly. And so that's where the rebuilding started. And we had to just really hone in. And again, we were brand new to landscaping. We were looking for any service business just because both Evelyn and I ran really large teams for the government. Evelyn's background— she worked for DHS and she would basically take any of the policy that was to be implemented and she would build it out. You know, she had over 500 people under her, and same with me. I would take policy based FCC-related, build the teams out, manage the engineers, get it done. So we weren't worried about running the business. Every business faces very similar problems. That was not our worry, and it still isn't. It was just— we were dealt a really bad hand with our seller and we got to the point about six months in that we were like, okay, we have to really understand what we have. We have a massive bank note. We have 50 employees. We have to keep this business running.

Athena: Okay. Big breath. Wow. I mean— and then it's— there's no way of knowing what the true numbers are, right? Like what's the extent of fraud? No real customers. So it's not like you could go back through the books and be like, what do I actually have on hand? You bought something that did a total— like, I mean, you got catfished with this business.

Denise: Yeah.

Athena: You know, like it's not at all what you thought it was and there's no way of figuring out what it really was apart from just going through it and— you know, you personally guaranteed this business.

Denise: Yes.

Athena: You got all these people's livelihoods dependent on you. Imagine you have customers that you still wanted to keep, that you need to service. Right?

Denise: Yeah. And we were trying to preserve the business and now we did learn that sometimes it was not worth preserving because of how shady the business dealings were. When you have a bad seller, you probably have bad employees too. Mm-hmm. Especially because he used his employees sometimes on the weekends to go work. He also like hung out with them. So they had like personal, interpersonal scenarios that I wasn't privy to. I came in later. And so it was a lot. We had to completely deconstruct what we thought was a pretty good-size, profitable business to a very poorly run, in-the-negative business.

Athena: Okay. So, I mean, at this point some people would just be like, I'm calling it, you know, I'll take the bankruptcy. Like, what—

Denise: Yeah.

Athena: So I'm glad, and I know you guys had some conversations, right? So tell us, what do you do at this point where you realize like, I got an unprofitable business and the bank note, and we've never done this before. Like, do you quit or do you fight?

Denise: So, we went through a lot. We started going down— so about seven months in, now we're seven months into the business, which is almost at the end of the year, November. The attorneys are still going at it because we sent a cease and desist. He said, yeah, right, whatever. He actually replied to it on his own. He wasn't even getting represented until we started going after him.

Athena: So wait, wait, wait. What did he reply on his own?

Denise: Oh, a 14-page reply saying that he wanted the attorneys to define what landscape was. And I was like, landscape is anything that that business used to do that we're doing, and they got down— when I tell you— and I had to make a very hard decision. We had to stop pursuing legal action because we were dumping tens of thousands of dollars into replies for the attorneys to be like, well, this is dirt work. Yeah, we have to grade. We do dirt work too, in order for us to do an install. We are grading dirt. Well, this is earthwork. Like it started— the replies started to get out of control and I went back to my attorney and I said, look— and he's one of the best ones. He's actually talked in a lot of SMB spaces on how to go about your non-compete. And Texas— we're in Texas too— like it's pretty ironclad. You know, you sell a business, don't compete. It was for three years, which we're at now— which we'll get to that fun part— but it wasn't even forever. It was 100 miles away. Don't do it. Stay away. Thank you. Have a good three years until you decide to come back into the market. And we knew that.

So after about $45,000 in legal fees and our money dwindling very quickly— during this time we started picking up accounts fast because we had to make up for whatever was losing. So yeah, we were picking up anything and everything. Like I needed to get my guys to work, I needed to get those invoices sent out and I needed to get paid. So we decided that we were gonna stop pursuing it. And I think it was— I had one of those moments of, I give up, I can't do it. Especially when we had that— it was a meeting and they're like, well, what we're going to do is we got the Webster's dictionary version. And I was like, Nope, I'm done. We are not stooping down to language. I learned the hard way that in law, it doesn't matter if you're right or wrong, it's who's gonna fight it the longest and who's gonna support this. And I want you guys to remember he had $2 million. I had $100K. So I had to just step back and say, I literally just paid him $2.5 million for this business. I cannot continue to fight this. Instead I need to pour those $15K into marketing. I need to pour those $15K into new jobs. I need to do anything and everything to not go under. And we did. We stopped. We stopped pursuing legal action. He continued.

And from there it was really hard. We finished the year— we're negative $100,000— and we were thinking we were gonna have to file for bankruptcy. Now, from when we found out that he was competing till the end of the year, I ran the business really skinny. What does that mean? We weren't investing in a CRM. We were doing the best we could with our trucks. The fleet was not in the best condition, but I was just hoarding money because I was very scared that something would happen.

And so in January of 2024, we did go visit a bankruptcy attorney and we told her everything that we had experienced and kind of gave her cash flow of what the business actually was. And it was probably one of the best experiences I had because it was a very brilliant human telling me like, okay. You're not ready to go bankrupt, you're nowhere near it. You're paying your bank note. You have money in the bank. You haven't missed a single payroll. You have to grind and it's going to be really hard, but you have to grind. And that two-hour meeting just really changed the trajectory of our mindset because we had a lot of fear, you know, thinking about it. I'm like, I have four more months to pay the bank. And that's if money still keeps coming in. Like, how am I going to get out of this? And that's what we did. We came back, we started seeing where we can cut cost, started selling ourselves. We were out there door knocking, meeting new builders, meeting with new cities, especially because we had such a government background. We were wanting to get in with cities and Evelyn's a veteran, so we were talking to anyone and everyone that would listen, and shortly after that, we started rebuilding this business.

Athena: Wow. Okay. So you— I mean, you're— that's the conversation that everybody's really scared of, you know? Like, you do this, like, shit. I'm a year in. We need to talk bankruptcy at this point, you know, and you're managing cash flow responsibly. You know?

Denise: Oh yeah.

Athena: You're like, I have four months worth of bank payments left.

Denise: And yeah, I've always thought about the bank. Like I never— we never defaulted on our bank loan and I never not paid my team. So it was always the— there are a few things that you really have to think about. Now, I will say things that I've learned through that that I wish I would've talked more about, because you're really scared. You're going through this on your own. You don't wanna fail. But it wasn't until after we got out of the red that I learned that I should have talked to our bank the minute I found out he was competing. But I had a fear that— they were gonna be like, wait, what? He's competing, the cash flow isn't there. Like, we don't wanna back this business. It's not real. So I had this large fear, and I don't know what it was— like what, they were gonna pull the funding? I mean, I already have the business, but you don't think straight. You're literally scared and processing and still working day in, day out at the business. But I learned that the bank is gonna fight for their money. He had $2 million, but the bank has millions of dollars. They're gonna protect their investment. So I should have reached out to our bank and said, Hey, this is what's happening. But I didn't. I was just very on top of making sure that they got paid and the team got paid and the business was still running.

Athena: Yeah, I think— I was getting my notes out to write a note down to ask you about that, because I remember you saying that, and it's something really important. You know, the relationship with the bank isn't over when you get the lump. This is a partner that you want to know is in your corner if and when something like this happens, you know, and had you spoken to them, then you could have gotten their legal resources. They would've known people to talk to or they might have even paid for lawyers or gotten involved and helped you through it, you know. And the banks all have teams to help you when things start going south and it might feel like, ah, you know, they're getting involved and they're scrutinizing me, but like— man, they don't wanna lose the money and they certainly don't want you to go bankrupt because then they have an asset that they're gonna have to try to divvy up and sell and liquidate.

They don't wanna go through that process. They want you to be successful. So when you're exploring lenders that you're gonna work with, also think about like, is this somebody that I want to be in the trenches with? You know? Yes. Like, truly. So that's an important point. Do you mind saying who your lender was? Like, did they tell you this afterwards and they're like, gosh, I wish you came to us and we could have helped you.

Denise: So we went with Grasshopper originally, and they're a bank.

Athena: I've never heard of—

Denise: They're a bank out of New York and they actually usually fund like, um, like IT deals. And so I felt like our background and our process was seamless with the SBA, I think, 'cause we had all of our ducks in a row. We really understood the process. But in January, when we went to go visit a bankruptcy attorney, I refinanced my loan.

Athena: Uhhuh.

Denise: So right as that was happening, I refinanced it and now I'm with U.S. Bank on a fixed rate. Like, I don't know if you guys remember, 2023 was crazy. The rate climbed from like eight to 11 in like four months. We were in that bubble, but we ended up refinancing and now I— oh gosh.

Athena: In that too, I mean now we're modeling deals out at 10, 11%. But at the time, you— and yeah, you were on 8%.

Denise: We modeled it at eight and by month four we were at 11 and a half. It was crazy. Yeah, that was another fun part. Oh my God. That was just— that was a crazy year. It's like everyone that year had that same experience. And now I'm with U.S. Bank and like you said, Athena, it's so important that whoever you choose to be your lender, that they truly value the relationship with you as the buyer. Why working capital is so important— that it exists and that they're willing to provide it. Every seller out there is like, oh, working capital, that's on you. You know, like it's very— you have to truly understand what that is and your lender has to be fully on board. It has to be outfitted in the deal so that they support that and you're not struggling your first few months.

Athena: Yeah. Um, okay, so we're in January, we're deciding we're not gonna file for bankruptcy.

Denise: That's right.

Athena: We've been told we're okay, we're just gonna have to grind.

Denise: Yep.

Athena: We've decided not to pursue legal action. We're in the negative, in the red. Like, where do you go from here?

Denise: We had to work really hard. A lot of long nights. A lot of learning from your peers, reaching out to people in our business. At this point, we weren't trying to be the best. We were trying to stay afloat, but people that are the best know how to do that. So we started reaching out to any landscaping company in the DFW Metroplex that was willing to take a call, just do some mentorship, because I didn't know what I didn't know. All I knew was that this business was not what I thought it was. And now I had to basically build it. And in January of 2024, a year in, I basically had a startup. I had let go of a lot of the old employees because they were as shady as the seller. They had all worked together for 12 plus years. So that was really hard. And I started plucking in new individuals that would fit the role. And so I started focusing on that. It was no longer like whoever—a warm body? No. It was very strategic, industry experience or adjacent industry experience that understood what the role was. And slowly but surely as we plugged those holes, it started to feel less and less like we were sinking.

Athena: How long did it take before you felt like— when you know, okay, it's January, and you're just like, I don't think we're gonna be able to do this. How long before you got a glimmer of, I think we can do this.

Denise: I still feel it now. Like, even— and I'll let you guys know where we are today— but I feel like every few months I felt like, okay, this is getting better. This is a little more bearable. Now we believed this was a less owner-involved business because he had so many employees in place. He had a manager tier and then a lead tier before the actual team. And when we were letting those people go, we were taking on those jobs and so we were learning those roles and being in them actively. Like, I still project manage our landscape designs because I'm so picky with how I want things that I want it to be perfect. I know I'll have to give that role up soon, but we need to take ourselves out a little bit. But it was— once we started plugging in those people, I think about six months later, and we had more money in the bank every month. That number was just climbing. Finally, not negative— $50K, $100K, $200K. And so at the end of last year— so just six months ago— we— and again, I've been running the business really skinny. So even after the bankruptcy conversation, I'm still hoarding money. I'm like, guys, we're gonna figure this out, but no, we're not buying new trucks. Guys, we're gonna figure this out. But no, we're not buying new tractors. Like, just really running the business as skinny as I could without, you know, falling apart. And so it was probably the end of November that Evelyn and I said, I think we can do this. I think that we can grow this business. And at that point we were in the positive, we were green. We had built almost— I think we were at like 70% new staff by then. And we finally felt like we were getting out of the trenches.

Athena: Eleven months.

Denise: Yes.

Athena: After. And that was like almost end of year two also.

Denise: Exactly. And so even— so fast forward to December, you know, we're looking at the numbers. What is the business actually? So end of last year, we are a $3.5 million business with an EBITDA of $350,000, end of last year. So we went from one year being completely in the red, going from $6.5 million to like $3.5 million, because those $3 million were either not real— even if they were real, they weren't profitable. It was just bill money and it was just— it didn't add up. And so that's where we were at the end of last year. And then where we are today— June of 2025— we are on track to be a $4.5 million business in revenue with a $750,000 EBITDA. So we are rocking and rolling. Yeah, there's a light at the end of the tunnel. We hired two new salesmen this year. We onboarded a new landscaping team this year, and it was all just by creating a plan, sticking to it, and creating improvement in every step of the way. We were very open to learning too. After our conversation with our bankruptcy attorney, we were huge on going to find all of the education we needed— either going or bringing it in. And so we attended webinars with some of the largest landscapers in this nation, and a lot of people don't know, but the green industry is one of the biggest industries nationwide. And another reason why I stopped the pursuing of legal action with our seller is because in my mind I'm like, yes, he's competing with me, but so are the other 100 companies in the DFW Metroplex. And I just needed to stop thinking I overpaid for this business. It's not what it's supposed to be. No. I am literally competing with 100 other landscapers— biggest in the nation. You know, you got Yellowstone, you got BrightView, and they're like my peers. So I'm not gonna allow the beginning of a very, very bad space for us to continue on, and we had to change our mindset and just work really, really hard to get out of it.

Athena: I mean, that's— we hear about the J curve, but my goodness.

Denise: Yes. Yes, that's when we felt it. That's something that you said— in November we were like, are we in the J curve? Like we kept saying it. And I'm very— we run our business really clean, as you can imagine. Like absorbing something so bad, we were like, we have to run our business the cleanest. Like, I don't even charge meals to my business. Like I just— it's the cleanest because I want to run this business in a very— I wanna grow it organically, but I also want to run it the way that I would have wanted to have bought it. And that's— I don't want ever anyone to experience this, but the only thing that I can do so that people don't is share my story. There's a light at the end of the tunnel and I know that I would never do that. And that's why we run our business the way that we run it.

Athena: I love that. And, um, so, Denise is planning on staying on past the hour, y'all— we got her for a little bit longer, so I just wanna preface that 'cause I have a lot more questions, but if you all have questions like, please feel free to jump in. But just to dig into some of the things we've talked about personally— you know, I don't wanna take your line away, but the way you think about building a business now, right? Like what— yeah, what did you say to me at the beginning of this call? 'Cause I think it's really inspirational in terms of what you can do with a business that you get no matter what state it's in.

Denise: Yeah, so one of the reasons I bought this business was because it participated in the H-2B visa program, and that brought 16 individuals from Mexico to work here with us for nine months. And that was really special to me 'cause my parents immigrated here. They were able to build their American dream and build a space for us to build ours. And so I wanted to be able to provide opportunities for my team to always be better. That's actually our mission. Our mission and vision are very close— of how we run our business and how we bring opportunities. My main goal is to bring opportunities to the people that work with us, whether that is in whatever capacity they want. If they want to be on a team, then great. If they wanna be a foreman, fantastic. If we have someone that comes in that wants to be in the office but would like to move up, we wanna support that. So we are always looking to provide opportunities to our team. Then our mission is that with those opportunities, we can best serve our community, because that's another thing that's really important to us. We want our staff to know that we care about them, so that when they go service those properties, those homes, those builders, they really care about it. And then in turn, we grow to be a good, reputable business. And so our mission came from what we got. Like, we were like, how are we gonna get out of this? And everyone knew the bad reputation that the business had too. And I'm like, how are we going to build something different? You just have to start and everything will follow. And that's really what's happened. Like I can honestly tell you that we have replaced 100% of the staff. So the Mean Green we bought is not the Mean Green that exists. And we have the best team. I pour into all of our team members. And they know that anything that they wanna do here, we're gonna help them achieve it. Because we truly feel that we're here to create opportunities for the people that work with us.

Athena: Okay, love that so much. And it's like taking such a— it's almost fuel, right? Like you had such— you were dealt such a crappy hand that it gives you purpose, it gives you a mission that you might not— I mean, you might have just bought this landscaping company and it's like, okay, cool, we got cash flow, you know?

Denise: By the way, yes.

Athena: Like, cool, that's what we signed up for. We wanted some cash flow and autonomy over our life. But like truly because of this experience, you're now so emotionally attached to the mission and the vision. And I feel that, you know, like I lost my perfect business and I'm like, I don't want anybody to go through that. So it's like— but I think one of the coolest things about being a business owner, whether you buy it, whether you start it, is you get to choose. Right. You get to make choices and for 99% of people, that is too overwhelming to be the sole decision maker or to make decisions about do I fire people, do I— like, what do I wanna do, do I work with these builders? It's overwhelming to have that kind of responsibility and autonomy. But you don't realize until you're in the driver's seat as a business owner.

Denise: Absolutely.

Athena: Right? It's like, oh shit. I'm the one that has to make the call on whether we cut off revenue and we don't have any revenue coming in. That's— you know, like, it's— it sucks. You have crappy decisions to make all the time as a business owner and, you know, crappy decision like, this guy deserves to pay. He is wrong. He defrauded us— like he should pay. And most people are gonna keep going after him because it's not right. But what's— you can be right, or you can win. And that's—

Denise: Right.

Athena: And I talk about this a lot, you know, it's like, yeah, for sure you can put all your energy into being right, but that might bankrupt you. Or you can win. You can make the decisions that strategically, emotionally— it sucks— but strategically, it's the right thing that's gonna get you the overall outcome that you want. And you came out the other side of that, now not only bettering your own lives, but bettering all the lives of your team and bettering the community as a result of that. That's phenomenal. And you got to make those choices along the way. But like, how the hell did you get through, you know, the first year— we heard about— but then the next 11 months of facing bankruptcy? Like, I can't imagine you were as positive and feeling good about things. So like, you didn't get up every day and go into this business. Like, how did you do it?

Denise: It was really hard. But we choose our own hard. And I love that you said that about making the decisions. Once we got out of our own way— 'cause sometimes we are the ones that are preventing ourselves from peaking— once we mentally said, we have to always question, are we getting in our own way? Are we going after— or is something a sticking point that doesn't need to be? Once we started— every decision we made was like, are we getting our own way? Are we stopping ourselves from being better by, you know, saying a hard no or stopping and being like, oh, let me think about it. You can't— there is no thinking about it in this situation. You have to make a decision and go with it and follow through and see where it takes you, and then make another decision and go with it and see where it takes you. There was a lot of dark moments. I'm not gonna lie. Everyone talks about like being on the bathroom floor, curled up crying— that happens, you know, and then you're just like, it's okay. I'll be okay. And sometimes you don't know if you're gonna get out of it, but you fight very hard and hope that you do. And I think that we did that. And there's still times, guys— like right now, yeah, we're smiling, everything's good— there's still times where we're like, oh man, how are we gonna deal with this? Like right now I have a backlog because we have a lot of rain and my sales guys are like, I can't close because people don't wanna wait for five weeks. What do you do? Do you keep going? No, you stop, assess. Okay, we need a new team. Come on in here, let's reduce this backlog. They are quick decisions. There is no— you have to think strategically, but you have to make a choice. And that was the biggest lesson through this whole thing.

Athena: I get so inspired listening to stories. Like, I think some people listen to this stuff and they're like, I'm out. You know, I get inspired by resiliency. 'Cause I think there's people that do different things. When challenges happen, you either freeze, you run, or you fight, you know?

Denise: Yeah.

Athena: And fighting ultimately is— to me, I'm a fighter. And Anka and I talk about this a lot. Like, we're both like, okay, how do we fix it? How do we fight through this? You know? It's the natural response. Even though, like, I cry maybe on a weekly basis. You know, like— and things are great. My team is great. I'm meeting clients. You know, like, it's still hard. Like, oh, SBA wants an SOP change. Like, okay, let's look at that. So, it is, it is— even with the business that you love and you built a business you now love, there are still challenges as a business owner. And so it's that mentality like, I need to fight. And sometimes for me it's like the crying lets me have my moment, feel sorry for myself, and then it's like, okay, now we fight. But I like pulling stories like this out because what you were saying about getting out of your own way— it's something that we see in the deal process so much. And you're very active in the ETA community. It's like you can have a great deal in front of you and sometimes you'll make little things big things to stop yourself from moving forward because that decision to take on a personal guarantee, to put your whole— everything— on the line, to be the person that's responsible for the success or failure of something in totality when most people haven't experienced that before working for other people— it's like, you're gonna make these little things into big things. So, but then we hear a story like yours, and it's like, well, in hindsight— hindsight's 20/20— but do you think in another galaxy or universe you would've been able to anticipate any of this going into it? Was there anything that you saw now that maybe you should have seen then that could help other people? You know, it's very rare you hear stories like this of fraud, but it happens.

Denise: Yeah. Sometimes— there were some red flags. There were. You just don't— sometimes you don't think that they actually affect the business, so maybe you foresee them. The org chart— when we got it, there were some changes to salaries from the original— from the original SIM that we got. 'Cause once you start getting involved, you're under LOI, you start getting org charts and what their salaries are. So about like three weeks into meeting— 'cause we started meeting weekly. Now one of the things that was weird is that he only wanted to meet on the weekends, but we understood that he was running this very busy business. And he told us that the staff knew— that I had been preparing the business to sell. And everyone's very aware, everyone's been a part of this— tidying everything up. No. When we showed up day one, the staff had no idea. They actually thought we were delivery people because we came in with like lunch for them that morning and they're like, are you here to deliver something? And we're like, no. And we look back at the seller and he's like, okay, everyone have a seat. I have something to share. And we were like, what? So we had people crying. And so I think what I would have— the red flags that we should have— like, let's try and get some more information about the staff, was we never met with anyone from the staff. I think I would've liked to have gotten some more information from the actual key employees. And now that we look at other businesses— because we have looked to absorb another landscape company— we— every red flag we saw, we now are like pursuing it. Anything that didn't make sense in the financials, anything that— anything that your gut feels like it's off, you have to pursue it. You have to ask why. And the weekend one was always really weird. Like we wanted to see the teams roll out on a weekday and there was always a reason why we couldn't, and that should have told us that there was some secrecy behind the sale, which then would've told us that it's gonna be really hard to get these people to buy in too.

Yeah. The day that we closed, he got very wasted after our closing, and that's when I learned that he gambled, 'cause him and his wife went to the casino immediately after closing. I mean, you have two meals, so— but I should have— it should have been like ding, ding, ding because for me it was like, oh, okay, great. We went and had a few congratulatory drinks and then I— we were like, all right, we have a business now we have to run. So, but then he went there. And during the transition process there were some red flags too. He was never on time to work. He was completely disconnected. He could never give us a straight answer of where the contracts lied. We knew they existed. We knew that the revenue was there for them, but we had to do a lot of digging. So if you're looking for a business that has those recurring contracts, they should be able to share them in the LOI process, especially if you are under LOI and there's no issue for you to see them. It's important to verify. Trust, but verify. I think that was my biggest lesson with him. But no, there were for sure some red flags that we should have probably paid more attention to. He was in a dispute with his brother right before— he had said they had separated. They were a fence and lawn care business for five years and then three years before we bought, they separated. And the story we got— it was just like, they're twin brothers. They just didn't see eye to eye. They separated. And once we dug into that, it was a little more— I think he had also— it didn't end well with his brother. There were some money issues there and we didn't pursue that. So we trusted too much and didn't verify enough.

Athena: And it is— it's horrible too because, you know, the relationship is so important throughout, and like I said, like 99% of sellers are not trying to defraud you to this kind of level, you know? I mean, he went to that point of like, actually going out gambling, creating invoices, running the money through, like, and then paying the referral fees out of a personal— so it wasn't hitting the bank, you couldn't see it. There was intention. 'Cause they don't look at the seller's personal bank account during due diligence.

Denise: Right.

Athena: Like, no, it's not part of it. Just tax returns. So like he's doing things to inflate. So, you know, how could you know something like that when everything and all the right people are looking at it. And so he went to a level that like most people don't. But I will say, you know, a lot of sellers are really uncomfortable with introducing their team to a potential buyer, right, until it's closed. Because it's like, well, what if this doesn't go through and now I've unsettled my team and I gotta try to like calm them and continue to run my business if the sale doesn't go through. So, that is true. How do you feel about that? Because we do hear a lot of people— and I don't think that's a red flag necessarily. It's maybe the owner's really concerned about— he or she cares about their team and they don't wanna unnecessarily create a lot of discomfort before they know for sure something's gonna come through.

Denise: Agreed. And I think— I think it doesn't hurt to ask. So there's two answers in this world: yes and no. And you already have the no. So, we recently met with another woman-owned landscaping business in this actual city, and she's looking to sell because her interest is kind of gone. And we asked her, I'm like, Hey, we would love to meet with the team. And she's like, I don't really wanna do that until we agree on an offer, any contingencies. But we were okay with that. Like as long as we had the ability to meet with key players. And we also shared like, Hey, this is what happened, and we just didn't want that to happen again, if these are your key players. And she's like, okay, I understand and I'm willing to. But I would not say that that should be a deterrent where you're like, oh, I'm out if I can't meet. No, there are many, many businesses that will move on without you because they will find a buyer that doesn't need to meet the entire staff. I do agree with that. But it doesn't hurt to ask. And I think now I'm always like, Hey, would you be open to it? And by the way, our seller told us they were— until we didn't get to meet them. So I think that's where it was like, oh, I wish I would've pushed more.

Athena: Oh, okay. They said yes, yes, yes, but they never actually facilitated the introduction. So, absolutely. Right. Like, are they following through on the commitments and promises that they're making you before? Paying attention to words and actions alignment.

Denise: So important. I think that that's so key. So if you ask them for something and they agree to it, but— you know, during the deal you're like, well, what's happening? That's very telling on a seller side.

Athena: Okay, so I think you know this about me, but I'm always using like dating analogies, relationship analogies— acquisition matchmaker. Yes. It's very similar when you're buying a business, right? And like when you're dating someone and they're like love bombing you, like this classic narcissist love bombing, right? Like promising you this— we're gonna go on this trip and we're gonna do that, and that, and that. And you gotta pay attention to do the words actually match the actions because you get enamored with the relationship and they're promising you things. And you know, it's really exciting. And it seems like we have a really great— I mean, the people that can do these kinds of things are the ones that can— they're great sellers, they're great at building relationships, they're great at charisma. You know, like, man, I get done by that too. And it's like somebody who's really likable can be a really nasty person behind the scenes. That's how they're able to get away with a lot of this crap, truly.

Denise: And pay attention to how involved this person is in the business. Even though he had a sales team, we ended up finding out down the line that he was like the main salesperson, and that was never disclosed. So that's why we were like losing revenue so quickly because he was no longer selling. He was no longer out there. And we did not know that. And there's no way to know that. You know, you— just like Athena said, you are love bombed sometimes by your seller. And we learned later that he had a very difficult time having hard conversations and saying no. So anything we asked, it would be like, oh yeah, I'll get that to you. Or like, oh yeah, we'll go through that. Oh, you don't understand that in the financials. Let me walk you through it. Like, he had just a really hard time saying no. So we felt that we were getting all that information that we needed, but the reality was— sometimes it wasn't fully true and we didn't know the full extent of it.

Athena: Okay. I love what you said earlier. There are two answers, yes or no. And take note of this because when we feel like we're in negotiations or when we feel like it's gonna be a hard ask, you know, the way— and I think Denise and I are very similar in this— is like, we'll be friendly, we'll ask it in a really nice way. It's like, Hey, do you think this is possible? But actually, yeah, asking for something that genuinely might feel like a hard ask, you know? Yes. So the worst case scenario is they say no. You know, you wanna ask for a forgivable performance note. Worst thing they can say is no. You wanna ask for, you know, them to take 5% and put it on 10-year standby so you can offer a bigger purchase price and have less money in for your equity injection. Worst thing they can say is no. So as long as you ask it in a way that's not like complete— like, I don't believe in the hardball negotiation and like—

Denise: Yeah. You know, last and final.

Athena: Yeah. We're also women, so that's not— we influence, we don't have to do that, you know. But like, men or women, I think there's a way of influencing conversations and kind of getting to where you want, where it feels like a win-win and we're being collaborative and having a conversation. So, you know, asking for things and giving some context. So I like what you said about like, well, the seller said she was uncomfortable with that, and it's like, okay, cool. Let me tell you what I went through so you understand where the ask is coming from. And then they're like, oh, okay. Yeah. Like, so what we need is comfort, you know, and— so like, this is what we're suggesting, but like, what would you suggest to help us— give us some comfort there now that you know what we've been through.

Denise: Exactly. And the whole “there's two answers, yes or no— and you already have the no”— I live by that. Even during this deal, there were things that I was like, I wonder if he's willing to like front some working capital. I wonder if he's willing to put some equity injection so that ours is lower— exactly what you said. And I think 80–85% of the time, all my wonderings did become an ask. And yes, he injected 5%. He gave us working capital. Like— yes. So it never hurts to ask. And sometimes, you know, your attorneys may be like, well, that's a little much. No, it's your deal. At the end of the day when the deal closes, it is you and the business. It is not your attorney. It's not the SBA. It's not your QoE guy. It is you and the business. So ask for whatever you think you may need.

Athena: Yes. Love that. And folks listening in, if you have any questions, feel free to put your hands up. I'm gonna keep asking questions 'cause this is fascinating for me. Obviously, love having these kinds of conversations. I see Peter, who is actually a fellow acquirer, raising his hand, so he acquired about seven years ago. And the world, the ETA world, is much different now. So, Peter, what's your question?

Peter: All right, so a couple things. At the risk of being perceived as a classic narcissist love bombing right now, Denise, I want you to know that your story— your ETA story— it's just absolutely phenomenal. I loved every moment of it. I can relate to so many things and the, you know, treacherous journey of that J curve.

Denise: Thank you, Peter. I appreciate it.

Peter: So my question— what mental practices did you adopt when you were at like the real bottom of that curve? It was clear, like, you know, you just met with a bankruptcy attorney. It's like you're at the bottom of the curve. It's like you're in a tunnel, there's no light. You're like, it's dark, it's really dark. You know, on the day-to-day, did you adopt any new mental— because all this stuff happens in the mind— to keep taking, to stick to the plan, to follow the plan, to like keep going, right? So much of that is a mental game before you see your results, where then it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. But like, there's this gap where it's like, there is no self-fulfilling prophecy, right? All you see is darkness and you have to like, you know, sort of play a mental game. Like, I'd be curious to understand sort of what habits you adopted in that kind of zone and just that whole mental game.

Denise: So, before we bought the business, I actually became a certified yoga teacher 'cause I loved yoga. It was just— it's a beautiful practice, just the physicality of it and then just everything behind it. And so I had to surrender. I had to fully surrender to what was happening. There was no denying it. There was no fighting it. It was just surrendering to what it was, and then figuring out how to move forward. I had to just let go. And during this, you don't wanna let people down. And, you know, Evelyn is my life partner and my business partner, and I know that she didn't wanna fail. And you don't want your family to know that you're failing. We didn't even tell anyone that we were going through this. We were just going through it, you know? And so there were moments of— and, you know, here was the good thing: when she was low, I was like, we can do this. And then when I was low, she was like, we can do this. But we just had to surrender, acknowledge it, and speak on it. Be like, Hey, this feels like we're kind of— you know, and I don't know how we're gonna get out of this. And once we surrendered, then you could build mentally. And I love that you brought this up because I still practice this on a daily— even right now. Like right now, I feel good. I'm at the top of my season. My guys are doing great. I create a list of things I want to do when I'm feeling good, because sometimes when you're feeling down, you have no idea what makes you feel good. So I write down, I love going to yoga, I love going for walks, I love running. When you're down, you can't even think of going for a walk. And so you have to open up that— you have to create a toolbox for yourself. I love to travel. I'm an adventurer. When I'm down, I can't even think of that. But sometimes, now that I have these tools— you know, we can get away to Tulum. When I'm down, I'm like, I'm stressed. I can't even think straight. I'm making bad decisions 'cause you're stressed. And you know, let's take a weekend trip to Tulum. You know, quick flight, two hours from Texas, two days, come back feeling refreshed. And that has just changed me as a person. I can— I'm able to feed myself a little bit of me when I'm not all there.

Peter: Wow. Awesome. Thank you so much.

Denise: Yeah.

Athena: Absolutely. Denise, it's something that I talk about with the team— like nourishment brainstorms, you know, like nourishing yourself. And this was a really profound thing that came up for me when I was living in London and I was a workaholic and I wasn't taking care of myself. And, like literally doing all the bad things and like nothing good. And I started going to therapy 'cause I was like, I'm depressed. I don't know what else to do. And my therapist is like, well, what do you do to nourish yourself? And I was like, I'm sorry.

Denise: Yeah. You're like, what?

Athena: Right? And she's like, you know, things that you do for no other purpose than to make yourself feel good. I was like, I don't— I don't know what that is, right. And I don't know if I can do it. And she's like, okay, let's start small. How about like, what about taking five minutes in the morning to just enjoy a coffee? I was like, I have to start working as soon as I wake up. And she's like, set a timer for like five minutes where you do— you know, don't look at your phone, just get your coffee and just enjoy your coffee. And it was so uncomfortable for me because I didn't feel like I deserved it. And then I went, you know, full into the nourishment game. I ran away to the circus. I was like, you know, doing all the spiritual stuff, you know. I messed around with some— I lived in Tulum two and a half years, so we're gonna have to meet down there at some point for sure. My parents still live down there. But, it's interesting now because, you know, I love work so much and it's a very different feeling of like, I want to work all the time, but this nourishment stuff is still really important to fill the tank, you know, and doing something that feels good and having that list of things— it's like, well, I don't feel good right now. I have very limited energy. Here's a list of things I like to do. Like, that's super powerful and I'm really glad you brought it up because you don't have— you can't call in— I mean, you can call in sick, but it's your own business.

Denise: Yeah, no, there is none of that.

Athena: Your loan payment's at stake, right? Like, it's like— I mean, I can call in sick, but I'm the one that I would call in sick to and like, shit. So making sure that you're maintaining yourself to be able to go the mile and not call in sick as little as possible. You know, this nourishment stuff— it's not just like woo-hoo. It's not self-indulgent, it's necessity.

Denise: No, truly. And one of the things I tell Evelyn and myself— burnout is real. You know, we go hard. And you don't stop. Like, you go home and you have dinner, and then you go to bed and you wake up like, oh, did I do that? Oh, this is a great idea. And you're like, write it down. And then you're like, all right, I'm going back to sleep. It doesn't stop. It's always— you're always thinking of the business. Always. So when you are not able to pour into yourself, you will not be any good. And I truly believe that the body keeps score. And if you don't take the time to take care of yourself, your body will do it for you in the most inopportune time— like you have back-to-back meetings, people are out sick— like in the most inopportune time. So I have tried, and this year— now that I'm— again, we're rocking and rolling, you know, we still have the J curve. It's good— it like goes like this, but reality is like this. It's like— there are still times. Like maybe a month ago I was like, oh, what am I gonna do? My parents really wanted me to go out to LA and visit them, and they don't fully understand that I can't be there as long as I used to be. Like with my W-2, I'd take two weeks and go visit them in LA. Like now I'm in and out— flying Friday, I'm out by Sunday— and they're like, oh, you can't be here. And it stresses me out, you know, having to still be like, okay, I'm gonna be there. But no, I— now take the day before, work from home. We've now started carving out those days. Like working from home one day and then being— so that the business operates fluidly like that. You know, maybe once a week, twice a week— hopefully maybe next year, twice a week. And just really still filling my cup. And I will say, now that things are rolling a little bit better, the business does energize me. I am exhausted, but I really care and value my staff. And so as long as— like, when I can see them growing and like if they make a mistake and, you know, you correct it and they get it next time and now they're looking for more to take on and you're like, oh, this is so good. You know? So now that does energize me. But of course, like— we're commercial landscape. Like my guys break $5,000 windows sometimes and you're just like, that's— you know. I have a $4,000 Japanese tree that died because it decided to get like 100 degrees randomly and then the next day was back to 50. So you still have different levels of stresses, but as long as you are cognizant of like, I have to take care of myself, it really does help you be able to be the best version of yourself.

Athena: Yeah, I love that. Is there like anything small daily that you find yourself doing? So you have your list, but like what do you do when you have no energy? What do you do when you have no time and— is there a routine or a practice or just something you say to yourself to get through the day?

Denise: Yes. So me and Evelyn— we do treat ourselves to like a nice dinner sometimes when things are like really— and it happens once a week. And now we like it. Like before it was like, oh, I'm gonna treat myself 'cause we're having a week. Now it'll be Wednesday and she's like, do you wanna go have like a martini? Like a nice— like, yeah, let's go. And so that has— like we look forward to that now— like midweek. But for me, I like to drive to the office by myself because I wanna ground myself for what's to come. One of the biggest challenges in a business are the people. And I love humans. I think they're great, they're very unique. Everyone's different. Everyone has a different personality. Everyone has a different— like, everyone learns different. So I really want to be of value to my staff. And the only way that I can is if I'm in a good state of mind. And sometimes I can't sleep and it's hard. And the mornings are like, oh, this is rough. But I ground myself on my way to work and just— quiet, just me and my thoughts. And by the time I get to work, I've thought about a lot of what was on my mind. So I'm not coming in with a very cluttered brain. I'm coming in with, like, action. This is what I want. And again, you can't get there if you're so stressed out about everything. So it just— you need to find a way to ground yourself and everyone does it differently. People work out in the morning— you know, like you said, Evelyn loves like a quiet cup of coffee in the morning. Just her and her espresso. And I love that for her. You know, I drink my coffee very fast, so I cannot— I'm not a coffee enjoyer. I'm like, all right, let me get that— you know. But yeah, I understand. Everyone's different. Just finding your reason to be like, all right, I'm gonna ground myself.

Athena: Yeah. I have to move my body. I'm actually seeing the same therapist again. I started working with her from London.

Denise: Oh, good.

Athena: And she's incredible and has helped me so much, but she knows me, she knows my history, she knows the bad parts of me and also seeing me go through the good. And was meeting with her a couple weeks ago and I was like, so I'm not working out right now. And she's like, okay. Coach mode— like three times a week minimum. You are one of those people that you have to move your body to process things and like— it's a non-negotiable for me because if I don't, I'm a physical person, so if I don't work that crap out of me, it just like circulates and it does no good to anyone. Right. So yeah, I think what's important to pull out from all of this is like, even before you buy the business, finding that practice. Because, you know, shit's gonna hit the fan in one way or another— hopefully not to this extent— but you're just gonna have moments as a business owner. So finding that way that you're finding your center, you're processing things, you're nourishing yourself so that you can sustain things because you're the one that has to show up every day. You know? You've got everything on the line.

So, I'm curious— going through what you went through, do you regret having bought a business?

Denise: You know— it just depends on when you ask me. Like today, I'm like, no, I'd do it again. I'm ready to acquire more. But yeah, there were— there are times where you're like, what have I got— you know what? I don't know if I've ever regretted it. I feel that, yes, I mean, I had a bad seller, but that could have happened to anyone. And one of the things that I've learned through these last few years is that it does happen. Like, people don't talk about it enough, but it does happen and it's okay. People are okay at the end of it. But sometimes— I had a— I think, and I don't know how bad this is gonna sound— my job was kind of cush, you know? Like my W-2 job was cute. I was working at home. I was making six figures, you know, it's fine. And yeah, sometimes in the beginning, yeah, I did miss that. I was— I was able to make myself breakfast and go to yoga when I wanted, and yeah, you miss that. But now I have some, you know, different wins and no, I don't regret buying my business. I do think that we're on our path to what we really wanted out of this, and every day you learn something new. And that's the best part. Like, you're always learning— what you didn't know yesterday, you'll know today. And I think— I'm a big experience human. Like, I live for the experiences and sometimes you have to go through things to truly understand where you wanna go. And I went through this and, you know, I'm a better person because of it.

Athena: Well, yeah. And you're helping other people. You're inspiring me. You're inspiring the folks listening, you know. Like you're helping out the community by sharing your story and speaking up when a lot of people won't. Like, before we jumped on, you know, Denise was saying they shared this story at SMBash. And like four people approached her afterwards: like, this happened to me and I was just too scared to share it. So thank you for being brave and sharing it with us today and inspiring. I feel really motivated and inspired. Like, man, if you can take that and turn it into something that's— something you're really proud of and was what you originally intended despite the hand you were dealt. You know, like to me that's a lesson in resiliency, in fighting through it, of just doing whatever it takes to get through it. But like, if you have that vision, you can do it. You can create— you said this— you can build any business you want. You know, you can create any business you want. So no matter what hand you're dealt, it's how you play it, you know? So thank you so much. This was awesome.

Denise: Absolutely.

Athena: I think everybody here really benefited from the conversation. I know I did. Every time we talk I'm just like, ah, more Denise time. Thank you.

Denise: No, thank you so much for having me. And again, one of the things— being a searcher, I learned so much and I met such amazing people and I love being in the space. Even though Evelyn and I already bought, you know, we're also looking for investments because we love the space. We believe in the space. Like, this is why we're still part of it. I think some people were wondering— we went to the first SMBash three years ago. I think it was in Austin. Yeah, it was in Austin. And we— at that SMBash, we were getting ready to close and we had just learned for the first time about private money. And I'm telling you, like we were so far in our journey and we didn't even know that other people were funding acquisitions, you know? And so being in this space, you're always learning, you're always absorbing, and the people are awesome. Being in a room with like-minded people that just really wanna get out there and be a business owner— we're a different breed. Like not everyone can do it. And if you even have the idea that you want to do it, to me, I want to be the resource in your life, and I'm happy to answer any questions and guide anyone in whatever way that I can because I had two really, really good mentors helping us down the line too.

Athena: Amazing. And thank you for offering that and being an active part of this community. If folks wanna get in touch with you, what's the best place to do that?

Denise: Email. If you wanna give my email and my work phone number— yeah, we can do that. I'm a texter. I'm a texter too, so if you wanna share that with them, then please do so.

Athena: Will do. Thank you again. I really appreciate you taking the time out of a very busy business life to share. And I can't wait— like we need to connect too in Texas, please. So I'll be in touch to arrange that. But thank you again for joining and everybody, thanks for listening and sharing and giving some energy on this absolutely amazing story. And we will be paying attention. I am really excited to see what you do with this business and, you know, I'm just very inspired. Always am. And I'm so excited that you've gotten it to the point that you've gotten it to— man, like you pushed through it. So that's amazing.

Denise: Everyone can do it. I think the lesson here is like, you can take any business and just really apply and grow it and just exist in it. It's awesome. So I am wishing everyone good luck here and, you know, a lot of success and if you guys ever need anything, reach out.

Athena: Thank you so much. Bye guys. Have an amazing rest of your day. Thank you. Thank you everyone. We'll see you soon. Take care. Take care. Bye bye.
