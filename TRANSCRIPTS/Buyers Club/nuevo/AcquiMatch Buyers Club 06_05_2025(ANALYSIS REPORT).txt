[Error #1 - Category: Misheard Acronym/Business Terminology]
Location: ~00:01:40 / Speaker: Athena
Transcript excerpt: "he is a QE provider, but also has been working a lot with buyers on, you know, what happens after LOI"
Issue: "QE provider" is ambiguous; in M&A diligence the standard term is "QoE (Quality of Earnings) provider"
Likely intended: "QoE provider"
Confidence: High
Reasoning: In transaction diligence “QoE” is the common term; “QE” typically refers to quantitative easing in macroeconomics, not diligence.
Impact: Medium - could confuse readers unfamiliar with M&A jargon

---
[Error #2 - Category: Misheard Acronym]
Location: ~00:01:55 / Speaker: Athena
Transcript excerpt: "Due diligence provider from the QOB side"
Issue: "QOB" appears to be an ASR error
Likely intended: "QoE side" (Quality of Earnings side)
Confidence: High
Reasoning: Matches prior reference to diligence and “QoE”; “QOB” is not a relevant acronym here.
Impact: High - incorrect acronym in a key diligence context

---
[Error #3 - Category: Business Terminology Distortion]
Location: ~00:01:25 / Speaker: Athena
Transcript excerpt: "How do we bro these conversations, um, what are kind of the negotiation tools..."
Issue: "bro" is nonsensical in context
Likely intended: "broach"
Confidence: High
Reasoning: Common phrase is “broach these conversations” in negotiation contexts.
Impact: Medium - briefly impairs clarity

[Error #4 - Category: Misheard Acronym]
Location: ~00:03:25 and ~00:04:45 / Speaker: Justin
Transcript excerpt: 
- "a big cohort of that was, you know, pe um"
- "we had the p offer we thought we were gonna go with..."
Issue: "pe/p" should be "PE" (private equity)
Likely intended: "PE" and "PE offer"
Confidence: High
Reasoning: Context is competitive bid process; PE is standard shorthand. Lowercase “pe/p” suggests ASR mishearing.
Impact: Medium - could confuse unfamiliar readers

---
[Error #5 - Category: Semantic Inconsistency]
Location: ~00:04:50 / Speaker: Justin
Transcript excerpt: "at the, at the ninth, bottom of the ninth"
Issue: Awkward, duplicated phrasing
Likely intended: "at the bottom of the ninth"

Impact: Low

---
[Error #6 - Category: Financial/Deal Terminology]
Location: ~00:39:20 / Speaker: Athena
Transcript excerpt: "there's probably gonna be a RET Trader two after the fact"
Issue: "RET Trader" appears to be ASR error
Likely intended: "a retrade or two"
Confidence: High
Reasoning: In M&A, “retrade” is the standard term for post-LOI price adjustments.
Impact: High - central to deal-process understanding

---
[Error #7 - Category: Business Terminology Distortion]
Location: ~00:39:35 / Speaker: Athena
Transcript excerpt: "Did he tell you in asking Bryce and structure and stuff"
Issue: "Bryce" likely misheard
Likely intended: "asking price and structure"
Confidence: High
Reasoning: “Asking price and structure” is standard; “Bryce” is a name, nonsensical here.
Impact: High - changes meaning of a key negotiating point

---
[Error #8 - Category: Entity/Proper Noun]
Location: ~00:30:40 / Speaker: Athena
Transcript excerpt: "Awesome. Paul. Yeah, I saw Steve just dropped..."
Issue: Calls “Polly” as “Paul”
Likely intended: Addressing “Polly”
Confidence: High
Reasoning: The participant’s name elsewhere is consistently “Polly.”
Impact: Low - minor but could confuse speaker reference

---
[Error #9 - Category: Misheard Acronym]
Location: ~00:58:30 / Speaker: Athena
Transcript excerpt: "just questioning the QV and that sort of thing"
Issue: "QV" is not the relevant acronym in diligence context
Likely intended: "QoE" or "Q of E" (Quality of Earnings)
Confidence: Medium
Reasoning: Ongoing thread is about diligence and QoE challenges; “QV” doesn’t fit.
Impact: Medium

---
[Error #10 - Category: Omission/Truncation]
Location: ~00:20:35 / Speaker: Athena
Transcript excerpt: "what other potential methodol, like if you were still the owner..."

[REMOVAL #1 - Type: Personal Anecdote/Off-Topic]
Location: ~00:56:05-00:57:20
Speakers involved: Steve (with brief interjections)
Content excerpt:
"…I wish Justin a couple years ago when we tried to get a roof… the big ugly company, state Farm… every house around us got a roof… adjuster… from Arizona, didn't even go on the roof…"
Reasoning:
Extended personal story about a past insurance/roofing claim experience. It does not add actionable value to the current deal strategy beyond a general illustration.
Context impact: Low—the conversation returns to business topics immediately after.
Recommended action: REMOVE ~00:56:05-00:57:20

---
[REMOVAL #2 - Type: Off-Topic/Small Talk]
Location: ~01:01:05-01:02:15
Speakers involved: Athena, Steve
Content excerpt:
"…He needs to spend some money and take out an ad on a milk carton… Do not trust this man… Maybe we could do a little pool and buy a billboard in Dallas… My boyfriend wants to… report him for fraud…"
Reasoning:
Jokes and personal commentary about advertising/shaming a third party; not relevant to the business analysis or deal-making guidance.
Context impact: Low—removing this does not affect understanding of any deal discussions.
Recommended action: REMOVE ~01:01:05-01:02:15

[BORDERLINE #1 - Requires Review]
Location: ~00:41:20-00:43:10
Content excerpt: "…this is an area that I am, my boyfriend has an exterior lawn maintenance company commercial, so… Guess who gets to pour through those contracts… I have too much knowledge on this area now…"
Business relevance argument: Provides context for the speaker’s domain familiarity, which can inform the quality of advice on landscaping deals and contract diligence.
Personal content argument: References to the boyfriend and personal involvement are not strictly necessary for deal analysis.
Recommendation: KEEP with discretion—trim to the business-relevant point that the speaker has direct experience reviewing landscaping contracts.

---
[BORDERLINE #2 - Requires Review]
Location: ~01:00:10-01:01:05
Content excerpt: "…schedule update… Thursday we’ve got Elliot… the following Thursday we won’t be having a buyer’s club… Was Denise not a Nailbiter? Like Luke was like, that was like watching Netflix…"
Business relevance argument: Announces a due diligence-focused session with a QoE expert that could be valuable to participants.
Personal content argument: Program scheduling and “Netflix” aside are not part of the substantive deal discussion.
Recommendation: REMOVE nonessential scheduling/banter lines while preserving the brief notice of the upcoming diligence session if needed for participant context.

Notes on patterns and ASR considerations:
- Consistent confusion around “QoE” (rendered as QE/QOB/QV). This is high-impact in M&A contexts. Consider boosting vocabulary/training for “QoE,” “Quality of Earnings,” and “retrade.”
- Occasional substitution of proper nouns (Polly→Paul; Buyers→Virus), suggesting phonetic misrecognition and potentially noise/crosstalk at those moments.
- A few truncated words and extraneous filler insertions; these are lower impact but noticeable.
