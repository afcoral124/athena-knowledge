Detected transcription errors

[Error #1 - Category: Misheard Acronym]
Location: Speaker: Andrew (leasing definitions)
Transcript excerpt: "what's the net operating income, which is commonly referred to as the N. O. Y."
Issue: NOI is mis-transcribed as "N. O. Y."
Likely intended: "NOI"
Confidence: High
Reasoning: NOI (Net Operating Income) is the standard term in CRE; “NOY” is not used.
Impact: High

[Error #2 - Category: Business Terminology Distortion]
Location: Speaker: Andrew (lease rate discussion)
Transcript excerpt: "sometimes they'll use the language market, right? I want to make sure I put some parameters..."
Issue: "market, right" instead of "market rate"
Likely intended: "market rate"
Confidence: High
Reasoning: “Market rate” is the correct leasing term; “market right” is nonsensical here.
Impact: Medium

[Error #3 - Category: Entity Name]
Location: Speaker: Andrew (listing platforms)
Transcript excerpt: "you can go to websites such as like CREXI.com... Oklahoma City. We do not have a huge craxy following"
Issue: “CREXI” inconsistently rendered as “craxy”
Likely intended: "CREXI"
Confidence: High
Reasoning: CREXI is a known CRE marketplace; “craxy” is a phonetic misrendering.
Impact: Low

[Error #4 - Category: Entity Name/URL Distortion]
Location: Speaker: Andrew (listing platforms)
Transcript excerpt: "Loop net, like L O O P N E N E T dot net dot com..."
Issue: Spelling and domain garble (".net dot com"; “N E N E T”)
Likely intended: "LoopNet.com"
Confidence: High
Reasoning: LoopNet is the public site (owned by CoStar) at loopnet.com; transcript muddles letters and domain.
Impact: Medium

[Error #5 - Category: Business Terminology Distortion]
Location: Speaker: Andrew (lease rights)
Transcript excerpt: "I want an option to purchase or a right of first refusal... I want to negotiate a row for... writer 1st refusal refusal"
Issue: ROFR (Right of First Refusal) rendered as “row for” and “writer 1st refusal refusal”
Likely intended: "ROFR (Right of First Refusal)"
Confidence: High
Reasoning: Standard legal/lease term; repeated phonetic/typing errors.
Impact: Medium

[Error #6 - Category: Financial and numerical errors (Units)]
Location: Speaker: Andrew (Family Dollar case study)
Transcript excerpt: "I'm getting 33 bucks a month. The market's like, 15 to 20..."
Issue: Unit confusion; lease rates are per square foot per year, not “per month”
Likely intended: "$33/sf/year versus $15–$20/sf/year"
Confidence: High
Reasoning: All prior math uses $/sf/year; “per month” conflicts and misleads.
Impact: Medium-High

[Error #7 - Category: Entity/Term]
Location: Speaker: Andrew (case study setup)
Transcript excerpt: "family dollar retail listing and VFE Oklahoma"
Issue: “VFE” instead of the slang “BFE”
Likely intended: "BFE"
Confidence: High
Reasoning: Common colloquialism “BFE” (rural/remote). “VFE” is nonsensical here.
Impact: Low

[Error #8 - Category: Semantic Inconsistency]
Location: Speaker: Andrew (cap rate discussion transition)
Transcript excerpt: "Power to suit. So."
Issue: Phrase is incoherent in context
Likely intended: A transition like “Power to sum it up” or similar
Confidence: Low-Medium
Reasoning: Doesn’t fit grammar or flow; likely ASR glitch
Impact: Low

[Error #9 - Category: Semantic Inconsistency]
Location: Speaker: Andrew (screen share)
Transcript excerpt: "All right. Can you guys see that Brad? Okay"
Issue: Random “Brad” appears with no referenced person
Likely intended: "Can you guys see that? Right/okay?"
Confidence: Medium
Reasoning: No “Brad” participant referenced; sounds like ASR mishearing “that, right?”
Impact: Low

[Error #10 - Category: Financial and numerical errors]
Location: Speaker: Andrew (Family Dollar returns)
Transcript excerpt: "my yearly profit on that is 91,000. So my return on the cash invested is 818 percent..."
Issue: ROI magnitude off by a factor of 100
Likely intended: "18% ROI"
Confidence: High
Reasoning: $91k / $500k ≈ 18.2%; he immediately references “18 percent” in next sentence.
Impact: High

[Error #11 - Category: Speaker Misattribution]
Location: Near session end
Transcript excerpt: 
  Ryan: "Yeah, happy to help. I got examples for days. So if anybody has questions..."
  Andrew: "[continues the same thought]"
Issue: The “happy to help/examples for days” line likely belongs to Andrew, not Ryan
Likely intended: Swap attribution for that line to Andrew
Confidence: Medium
Reasoning: Content matches Andrew’s role and prior statements; follows Athena thanking Andrew.
Impact: Medium

[Error #12 - Category: Entity Name]
Location: Speaker: Andrew (data sources)
Transcript excerpt: "LoopNet is owned by costar"
Issue: Brand capitalization inconsistency
Likely intended: "CoStar"
Confidence: High
Reasoning: Proper brand stylization
Impact: Low


Segments recommended for removal

[REMOVAL #1 - Type: Small Talk/Housekeeping]
Location: Opening lines (immediately after 00:00:00)
Speakers involved: Athena, Anke
Content excerpt:
"Athena: Hello, hello. Welcome, welcome... Hey, Gil, how's it going?... Looks like Joe is here and Destin is here. Hey, Joe.
Anke: Hey, good afternoon.
Athena: Cool. Good afternoon. Well, as always, this will be recorded..."
Reasoning:
Pure greetings/attendance chatter and recording notice. No business substance.
Context impact: None—topic begins right after.
Recommended action: REMOVE opening pleasantries up to “It is, uh, An episode of the buyers club...”

[REMOVAL #2 - Type: Small Talk/Joke]
Location: Mid-session (advisor sourcing discussion)
Speakers involved: Andrew
Content excerpt:
"Bars, divorce attorneys. I'm just kidding."
Reasoning:
Throwaway joke; not needed for business understanding.
Context impact: None.
Recommended action: REMOVE that sentence.

[REMOVAL #3 - Type: Administrative/Off-Topic + Small Talk]
Location: Closing section (final ~3 minutes)
Speakers involved: Athena, Anke, Ryan
Content excerpt:
"Athena: We are scheduling some exciting sessions to come on Tuesday... bring your deals... new Rolls Royce financial modeling templates... add rent increase...
... I always laugh when I say that because I know what it stands for living in the UK for a long time. Sorry, said a bad word...
... Have a great weekend... Thanks again, Andrew...
Anke: yeah
Ryan: So,
Anke: yeah."
Reasoning:
Session scheduling, template logistics, and a non-business profanity joke. Not relevant to CRE education or deal analysis.
Context impact: Low—conversation is already concluding.
Recommended action: REMOVE this closing admin/small talk block.


Borderline segments (requires review)

[BORDERLINE #1 - Requires Review]
Location: Market/tariff/politics discussion (later section)
Content excerpt: "Now, the new administration's getting in there... tariffs... what does that do to construction inputs... bring manufacturing back..."
Business relevance argument: Directly tied to CRE market conditions, build costs, cap rates, and risk—useful for buyers planning deals.
Personal content argument: Mentions politics broadly; could be seen as off-topic.
Recommendation: KEEP—Clear connection to market dynamics affecting deals.

[BORDERLINE #2 - Requires Review]
Location: Advisor-finding humor
Content excerpt: "Do not ask somebody who does both residential and commercial. They do not know what they're talking about."
Business relevance argument: Practical advisor-selection guidance for CRE due diligence.
Personal content argument: Strongly worded generalization.
Recommendation: KEEP—Actionable guidance; tone aside, content is valuable.

Patterns to flag for ASR system improvement
- NOI frequently misheard as “NOY”
- “Market rate” rendered as “market right”
- CREXI misrendered as “craxy”
- LoopNet.com domain spelling/formatting errors
- ROFR (Right of First Refusal) mangled (“row for” / “writer 1st refusal”)
- Random proper-noun insertions (“Brad”) during transitions
- Unit labels omitted or wrong (per month vs per square foot per year)
- Occasional numeric magnitude errors (e.g., “818%” vs 18%)

Speaker attribution notes
- The “Yeah, happy to help. I got examples for days...” closing line appears misattributed to Ryan; content fits Andrew’s role/voice. Consider swapping attribution for clarity.
