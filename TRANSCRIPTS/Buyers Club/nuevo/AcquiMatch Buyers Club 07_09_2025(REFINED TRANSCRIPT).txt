Athena: Curious to hear how a few of your deals are going. So, Polly, I was gonna start with you 'cause you guys have a really interesting situation with all these P&Ls going on. Do you wanna give a quick overview so everybody can follow along and then maybe give us some updates since you've had some broker conversations?

Polly: I'll do the best I can. So this particular franchise is a brand under a parent company with other franchises. It's a kitchen cabinetry and design business. They're a one-stop shop—they do the kitchen cabinets, the flooring if you need that, any construction if you're moving things around, the back splash with the tiling—they do all of that. So it's a turnkey package.

It's based in the Chattanooga area with three locations. Two don't really bring in a lot of revenue, and one does—that's the original location. It was a different business prior to becoming this cabinetry and design business. Anyway, it does the most business of the three. A lot of that is contractor business, but they do have some walk-in traffic. With the other locations it's primarily walk-in. The franchise is set up with all the systems—CRM, invoicing, all the things.

Marketing—they don't do a lot of marketing, actually. They have a 78% conversion, mainly from walk-ins. I learned they do have a call center, but the call center really does not include the design cabinetry business because there are too many variables. They use the call center more for the other brands—like roofing and other home-oriented businesses—where they can quote over the phone. So it's really walk-in business and relationships with local contractors doing new builds and putting their cabinetry in. About 70% of their business comes from cabinetry, and of course there's a great profit in that.

So we've been trying to decide—anytime you're dealing with franchises, you're dealing with fees, that's taken off the gross revenue. We've been going through the actual franchise agreement checking for surprises, which there weren't; it aligned with the write-up. Our biggest thing is do we want to own a franchise business paying all these fees, and the majority of the business is coming from one location, which they’re going to relocate—even though it's only like 10 minutes away. The contractors aren't going anywhere, but they're trying to improve walk-in.

From what the broker tells me, all three locations are getting a decent amount of traffic. I'd love to know each conversion rate—I haven't asked yet. The long and short is Steve and I are trying to decide if we can see ourselves in this business. They have a couple of managers who manage all three locations. They have designers in each location. It's more semi-absentee, but because it hasn't been doing as well as hoped, the owner—who is a co-, I guess you'd call him the lead franchisor of all these brands including the cabinetry brand—he owns these three stores. He hasn't been able to pour attention into them, so he's selling. It's interesting because you'd think if you were trying to sell franchises you'd use your own businesses as an example.

Steve: Polly, you wanna tell 'em about the different P&Ls and how stuff doesn't match, etc.?

Polly: Yeah. On the P&Ls there were missing numbers because they were pulling from different locations—primarily that first location that does the most business paying for what they needed to pay in some of the other locations. So the P&Ls were kind of messed up. I asked for clarification through the broker—he's been great—and he said when you look at those, where you see maybe one store has paid for digital marketing and the other two have nothing in that category, it's all coming from that other store. So it's a little interesting.

Athena: Did they do a negative add-back for all the royalty, brand marketing, tech fees for all three stores? I've lost track of the financial audit, but that was the big one that wasn't coming through on the best-performing store. In the SIM or numbers, did they include what you would be paying as a franchisee rather than the franchisor?

Steve: Are you waiting on some more numbers back, Polly? Because you're right—some of the stores weren't paying a franchise fee, right? One of 'em was paying a franchise fee—how does that work? I think the broker's supposed to get you more numbers and clarifications on that.

Polly: Yeah, he is. We're just trying to work through all of this and be able to take a real valuation of the business to determine if this is something worth pursuing—even though we weren't really interested in a franchise business to begin with. Hopefully by the end of the day he'll have the fees and so forth for me. It's about getting the numbers, doing a real evaluation of the business, and deciding if we want to do an LOI. That's where we're at.

Athena: I'm curious because my comfort level is definitely pushed on this one. But it's your risk tolerance that matters. What's keeping you interested? Are there variables you're in love with, or are you using this as a learning exercise? Numbers aside, how are you feeling?

Polly: A little bit of a learning experience, but I actually visited one of the Atlanta locations. It's in a great area. I talked to the franchisee—she was very good about answering all my questions. The showroom was really nice. She had a background in building and working with contractors, so she has relationships she’s utilized. I told Steve I can see myself doing that business because I do have some design background—commercial, restaurant design, fitness center design, hotels, health clubs—so I can understand everything. But we just don't know. Steve can't totally see himself in the business. We both have to see ourselves in it, in whatever capacities—he's better at some things, I'm better at some things. Some of it's just learning because we've never sat down and looked at a franchise business. It's probably good that we're going through this to determine if we'd ever want to look at one again.

Steve: We can't even figure out the financial model template with just one P&L—we're trying with three right now, so we'll really test ourselves. The biggest concern—two of the businesses aren't really making money. Would they even stand on their own? And if the franchise route was the way to go, why not pay a franchise fee and open a new building? It's less expensive and less risk. Right now with a 33% chance of succeeding from what we've seen, it has to be almost a no-brainer. We're deep into it; whether we choose to do it or not, it's interesting. Polly's background makes it more interesting for her, but at the end of the day the numbers have to make sense. We'll ride it out until we decide if it's worth putting up with all the BS.

Athena: Yeah, you're pot-invested and you're waiting for the river. Sometimes you're in a hand and you're like, I just gotta see the last card before I decide whether to push the chips in or not.

Polly: It's been good in that it makes you think if this is something we'd ever consider—this one or any franchise in the future. That was never on our radar; it was a big “oh no.” But we're not gonna waste time either. They do have a strong LOI, and I got a little lowdown on the buyer—he's a total absentee buyer. He said he'd come up for six months. He's from Tampa, in the medical business, made a lot of money—so maybe a fun purchase? I don't know what this business would really mean to him. But that's the only LOI they have.

Athena: My big questions at this point: if the big business is subsidizing the other two, what would the real cost be for each location? Is there a way—probably not at this point; that's probably a QoE stage—of extracting what expenses go where? And what would the royalty fees be, and did they calculate the original overall SDE including all the fees—the royalty fees, adjusted rent, all the other fees you'd have to pay? Were you given a number that included all that, or are there additional costs down the line?

Also, like Steve said, what's the cost to start one of these versus buying? The big location will be in new-location mode again; some contractor business makes sense, but it's still unproven to move to a new location. Then you've got the other two hanging on by a thread, and the guy that supposedly created this franchise isn't doing better. It makes me deeply uncomfortable.

Steve: On the positive side, Polly went out to see a location—that's another step in the right direction. But we had a conversation last night: if the numbers that come back aren't great, it's a good group discussion. Once we put an LOI and it's accepted, there's an additional investment for QoE, etc. That's a step we commit to. We were talking through the differences of an IOI and an LOI—why would anybody even use an IOI? We had this discussion last night and didn't have a clear answer ourselves.

Athena: So, why would anyone use an IOI—is that your question?

Steve: Yeah. Why do people use it when nothing means anything until there's an LOI? What's the point of an IOI?

Athena: Just to your earlier point, when you sign an LOI, you are committing to doing due diligence. But at least in our methodology, we don't want you to start paying for the QoE or the legal until you at least have some lenders look under the hood, which doesn't cost you anything but time and frustration. Usually, if it's not lendable, you wouldn't pay for the next stuff.

The difference between an IOI and an LOI: I don't love IOIs, because they don't tie into exclusivity. An LOI gives you breathing room—exclusivity—to start looking under the hood without the pressure of someone stealing it away. An IOI is basically saying what you would buy the business for, but none of the terms—it doesn't include working capital, owner transition, any of that. It's just "I would pay this much money." Maybe you include how it's broken down into seller notes, etc.

Brokers typically use IOIs as a vetting tool to see whether you're offering enough money; it's how they get paid. They'll disqualify or qualify you. A lot of people lie in IOIs just to get pushed forward, so if I were a broker, I wouldn't use it because it doesn't really mean anything. Sometimes in competitive deals they ask you to send IOIs; I don't think it serves the buyer well unless you're take-it-or-leave-it and removed from the outcome: "Under these circumstances, maybe I'd buy your business. Here's my offer you're probably not gonna like."

So in this situation, rather than putting together an LOI, when you get all the financial information—if they haven't fully recognized all the royalties that need to be in there (reducing the SDE), and then probably putting a significant performance note based on the percentage of revenue that the one location is that they're moving—so it's a 70% performance note or whatever, assuming it's 70–80% of the revenue of the three.

Gil: So—

Athena: Then I'd say: okay, 2.5x on this SDE—which we've calculated after all the royalties and adjusted rent and all other fees—plus 70–80% of this is going to be forgiven if the new location doesn't at least perform as it did at its old location. That's where I'd throw out an IOI, because it's not worth putting together an LOI if we're not on the same page about the risks and what we'd be looking at as a buyer.

Polly: That makes sense.

Athena: Based on your time going through the whole LOI process, this one has risk written all over it. But if it was like 2–2.5x, 80% forgivable, then it’s kind of a startup franchise cost. You could get in without too much risk, and if it didn't work out—if the new location didn't move or whatever—right? Put that in front of 'em; they'll say no. Then every other offer will fall through, and at some point they'll circle back: "So, you know that IOI you gave us—is that still good?"

Gil: Yeah.

Athena: That's when you use an IOI: when you're out unless you get an exceptionally good price and completely mitigate the risk. "Here's what it might look like. If you like that, we can put together an LOI."

Polly: Good to know. Anybody in the group had any experience considering purchasing a franchise business?

Justin: I get hit up a lot by franchise brokers on LinkedIn—there are a dime a dozen. I've never entertained a conversation or pursued it. I don't have anything inherently against them other than the additional fees. I've listened to some Acquiring Minds episodes where people went the franchise route, and I get it—benefits around structure, support, following a blueprint or playbook. A lot say it's a great first purchase because it's kind of like training wheels to an extent.

Gil: Yeah.

Justin: For me personally, I see a restrictive environment I don't want. I'd rather operate the way I see fit without a format I'd be beholden to. But that's just me—there are certainly good franchises that do really well.

Athena: And that's the thing. When there's huge brand reputation—like oil changes, you think Jiffy Lube; tires, Discount Tire—there's brand recognition you're paying for. Or someone who's figured out something complicated or super niche. We just discovered this company called DoodyCalls—like pet "duty," you know? We're customers now. They have a 24/7 call center where you can schedule someone to come out and they clean up the dooo out of the yard, weekly, and you're on a monthly subscription. They'll even deodorize the lawn. What a brilliant business design: amazing call center, you just need to buy in your local neighborhood; they're doing all the marketing and generating leads; you just deliver the service. There's not a lot of competition. Everyone wants that; nobody wants to pick that up themselves. It's a business model at least by the sounds of it.

Steve: But the other thing here is this isn't just picking up dog poop. There's a design element. You can't just put anybody who can put french fries in and pick it up. And the brand itself—I had never heard of it. It's not a national brand like, say, big HVAC names—you see them everywhere. It's more regional with a few stores. That's another negative. But as you said, we're deep into it; we want to see how it plays out. If nothing else, we get experience putting multiple P&Ls into the financial calculator and learn something.

Athena: I mean, it's a masterclass in finances for you guys—digging into P&Ls and every line item. For everyone's info, all three P&Ls have different things in them; they don't have the same line items for every store. There are things missing; things in one store that aren't in the other two. It's very confusing as to what it actually takes to run a store. Because of that, you're learning financial analysis in a way you might not have before when you're just looking at one location's P&L. You can ask: what is that line item? Do we need that? Compare across stores—the amount they pay for contractors at one store was like 7%, and another store was 0.5%. That's a huge variance. I love that you're looking at this as learning.

But I do think you'd have to hit 'em pretty low on an offer with a huge performance note before moving forward.

Polly: Oh yeah, absolutely. I told the broker we'd have an answer by Wednesday—that's tomorrow—let's call it Thursday at the latest. We'll get this figured out pretty quickly. It's time to move on to the next thing if we're not gonna do this.

Athena: I did personally look at a printing/mail franchise a long time ago. We need certain things printed, virtual mailboxes, etc. The location that wanted to sell had been running their shop for 20 years; huge part of the community; highest grossing store of the entire network for like 20 years into the seven figures—most others didn't break seven figures. The franchise group would send their reps down to get free consulting from this owner, send new or potential franchisees over to his shop to have him do training. He and his wife were good-hearted people who wanted to help but didn't realize they should be paid to do that and taken out of their business. And there was no fee waterfall for breaking seven figures—they were still paying the same royalties. So when it came down to looking at what his SDE was on a business north of seven figures, he and his wife's take-home was about $150,000 a year. The franchisor was making as much if not more than they were, and sponging off him for consultancy. That kind of stuff makes me angry—they built that business for 20 years and weren't gonna be able to retire off of it.

So my other question—are there fee waterfalls when you bust past levels? How are you rewarded for surpassing what others are not?

Polly: Yeah, that's very true.

Athena: Good food for thought. Any questions or anything we can help with in your analysis, or is it clear where you need to go from here?

Polly: It's clear where we need to go. Once we finish modeling it out, we'll determine whether we want to make a really lowball offer or not do it at all. We should know that by tomorrow when we talk with you in our meeting.

Athena: Great. Looking forward to it. Nice work. Cool—Justin, I was gonna pick on you next 'cause you have an interesting risk situation you're looking at. If you want to give an overview and talk that through—comes up a lot.

Justin: Yeah, it's fine. This is not something I'm taking too seriously. It's more curiosity based on the situation. The nutshell: Luke brought me an opportunity with a broker—wasn't a perfect fit—then the broker said, "I got this other thing." Off-the-track situation. It's a community in the real estate "guru" space—annualized subscriptions/memberships for an education platform in real estate investment.

I actually know the guy who's selling it; I took a webinar he conducted two years ago as an investor. One of my colleagues did join his program. Now he's selling the program I joined the webinar for. Small world. He is an influencer. The entire business has historically been predicated on his personal brand. He's the face, does content, all over social. In his space he's well known.

He wants to get into large-scale real estate development—he's got an operation in Dubai, tens if not hundreds of millions, substantial—taking a lot of his time. He's looking to get out of this community ownership business and go into development. So he's offloading the business. The risk is obvious: he is the business. How do you decouple the key-man, the only key man?

I asked him that. He foresaw this coming. He said he hasn't released anything with his face on it in 2025 because he knew the sale was coming. In 2024 and previously he was on everything. In 2025 he's not a part of member introductions. They've got trainers in place to man the community. He said he's got a playbook for however the new buyer wants to run it—if you want to be the face, there's a playbook; if you don't want to be the face, there's a playbook.

I told him I'm not going to be a public face; I don't want to be a social media personality. I want to run a business, not be a personality.

Athena: You'd be so good at it though.

Justin: I was an actor. I had a public persona pre-social media. I just don't want to be that guy—your life becomes content creation and this facade. The fundamentals I care about: is it profitable, how are you envisioning that? They're holding that close to the vest until LOI to avoid tire kickers. I get it, but I also don't want to spin my wheels if it's snake oil.

We're at a game of chicken on next steps. They're hopeful I'll submit an LOI. The broker called to sweeten the deal: there's $200,000 of accounts receivable that will convey with the business—runway as you step in.

Athena: It's probably like working capital that was determined in the business contracts as well—if he signed up a bunch of people and you gotta deliver for the next 12 months, is that the amount of money needed to deliver for this?

Justin: Exactly. I'm not taking on your clientele you reap financial rewards for, with nothing to show. That would've been part of my offer anyway.

Athena: It sounds like you're out on it—you were just having fun exploring it.

Justin: Because I know the personality, I wanted to meet him and see what he had to say. The upside: I believe he's an investor and knows the space. He’s monetized this educational platform to teach others—there's credibility. He knows what he's doing. The value I see—is there a way to do what a lot of gurus do: start educational platforms, bring in students, and use their students as deal flow? They partner with students, be a guarantor, get equity. I don't want to take advantage of anyone—but there is merit to building infrastructure for real estate investment opportunity. It's a very real thing that very real people I know do. Generational wealth off that alone.

He says he's got a sales team; it's fairly automated; he contributes a few hours a week. I'd contribute more. He’s done as much as he can to make it sound like an automated playbook—sales managers and teams, you throw marketing dollars and it delivers.

Athena: But who's gonna make the content going forward?

Justin: They've got a content team now—he's been the guy, and they had an in-house production (wife, brother) but he's farmed out to a content team that will run it. It doesn't have to include me as the face. They'll create the content engine as part of the strategic playbook they pass on. They have scripts written; it's all scripted, like a TV show mapped out on socials.

Athena: We were at Hormozi HQ—are you familiar with the Hormozis? When they sold Gym Launch, Alex was the face, so during their sale and transition they had to get ready for that. We listened in on some paid ad deep dives—just the way you have to do paid ads now: the amount of content, changing out the ads and copy weekly to keep it fresh and keep leads coming in—it's so much work. If he's been doing that all of this year without him being the face and the numbers have continued to perform, that might be interesting. But then what about getting into the community?

So where are you at with it? Are you toying with it?

Justin: It's like a distant third or fourth compared to the other deals.

Athena: Which I was gonna ask you about—you've got two.

Justin: I've got two I'm far more interested in that I'd rather take down. Those are the priority.

Athena: Any movement on either?

Justin: I got the LOI submitted for the roofing company. Waiting on feedback. The broker said the seller was right in the heart of the storms and floods, so he might be slow to evaluate.

Athena: Oh God, I bet. Roofs went nuts over the last—yeah, okay.

Justin: The properties swept away—whatever.

Athena: I didn't realize we didn't have gutters when we moved into this place, and it was just like bucketing it down. It might as well have been a fire hose on the top of the roof coming straight down.

Justin: Yep. An event like that really highlights if you've got holes or leaks—you’re gonna know quick with that amount of rain. So he's catching back up for sure.

Athena: Yeah, he's gonna be busy.

Justin: That's Claudio running that for me and getting his attention on it sooner than later, I'm sure. So yeah, standing by on that. The other one—I talked with Matt about the non-SBA coworking space opportunity. He put me in touch with his former boss from like 30 years ago who works at a bank but has a side hustle: a private lending club with individual investors that fit these deal size parameters. I had a call with him; he's lent on coworking spaces before, knows the model well. Good call. I'm sending him the SIM and my bio so he can look it over. Sounds like there may be a lead to a group with funds ready to place.

Gil: That was so cool.

Justin: I'm trying to find the NDA I signed because I want to see if it covers my lending representative, and I cannot for the life of me find it. I thought he saved it. Edita, can—

Athena: Can you pull that out for Justin—the Work Lodge one?

Justin: In the meantime I pinged the broker—she’s really cool. I asked if I could share the SIM; waiting to hear back.

Athena: Good. If not, you can have him sign one, but usually it covers you being able to go out and seek investment. If you happen to have access to the NDA, that'd be cool—I can check it out.

Athena: Edita can pull that for you, no problem. And we were just pulling some resources for you all should you need it. I just need to review it real quick—we've got two non-circumvention NDA templates as examples for you to pull from. With these types of groups, they want someone bringing them deal flow and an operator, so they don't normally circumvent, but if you're going to individuals that are also searchers or investors themselves, or just to actually cover yourself, you can use these non-circumvention NDAs—non-disclosure agreement plus "you can't go after the deal once I reveal the details to you."

I'll review so we can drop that as a resource. They're example ones—run it through GPT or adapt it. One is Sam Rosa’s template—pretty solid. And there's a template I used when I was raising capital that's a little less legallyese but gets the point across.

Justin: Cool, that'd be helpful. Oh, and I did talk to Matt about the roofing company as a potential SBA alternative. I texted him, he said "yeah, gimme a call." I called and got his voicemail, but he said he'd call me back.

Athena: Nice. Cool. Exciting stuff. I'll be interested—these influencer brands are so interesting. I always wonder, if you're so good at what you do, why do you start a community and sell it to people? He's basically so successful now that he can't do it anymore—his stuff outside of this is taking off so he can't give it focus.

Justin: I asked him the origin. He said he didn't intend to start the business. He'd been investing and developing as an investor. Peak COVID—he was bored—started doing TikTok dances. It's still on his page. People started engaging. He posted some real estate content not to be a guru—just what he was doing—and people said, "can you show me?" He helped a couple people informally, then more, and eventually started a community. He knew—what I know—that you can get partners and leads, bolster your portfolio if you're the guy people bring deals to. He's got equity positions in a lot of his students' deals.

Athena: That makes sense for deal flow. That's why the Hormozis too—they're the coolest family office I've ever seen. Everybody knows their names, so they get first pick of deal flow. Plus they've monetized by teaching and giving access to their portfolio team on a paid basis—still deal flow. Awesome. They haven't let me down on the guru side—lots of legitimacy, phenomenal team.

Justin: Sometimes there are good ones—real deal people—some are complete BS.

Athena: I'm always asking the good ones: what's the reason? When I can connect to the reason—creating deal flow for yourself 100%. You're educating people and potentially bringing great deals and they trust you. That makes sense. But just doing it for the sake of making money—not so much.

Justin: The amount he's getting in his personal take—he's getting way more wealth from his actual investments. This isn't to make a bunch of money. He didn't need it, frankly, and that's why he's selling—it's not worth his time anymore.

Athena: But to make money to get deal flow that gives you that kind of wealth is different than—

Justin: Why wouldn't you, if somebody will pay you to also give you deal flow? Icing on the cake.

Athena: Super interesting. We looked at another business kind of similar. Folks who build businesses off their likeness and face—it's dangerous when you get to the stage where you don't want to do it anymore. All these kids who want to be influencers—you’re creating a little prison for yourself you’ll never get out of.

Justin: That's the other reason I told him I don't want to run into the same problem you're having selling your own business. If I'm the face, I'm going to run into the same issue. If I can standardize not being the face and operationalize outside of the personal brand, then I'm setting myself up for a good sale.

Athena: I will say—not to keep bringing up the Ozzies—I'll drop the podcast link in the Buyers Club channel. Alex Hormozi did this podcast about when his mind shifted about building a brand—he was super anti for a while—then realized attention is the new oil. How is it that Jenner can drop a new brand and overnight it gets a billion-dollar valuation?

Justin: Yep. Yeah, it's true.

Athena: It used to be energy, then oil—now it's attention. Attention is one of the most valuable things you can have. Having attention allows you to do a drop and have a billion-dollar valuation even though without that you're literally not doing anything.

Justin: Same thing—personal brand.

Athena: That got me thinking. Not that I've acted on it whatsoever, but I kind of understand and I'm like 5% less repelled by the idea of being—

Gil: Yeah.

Athena: I'll find it and dig it out. You all might find it interesting. For those of us who are behind the scenes, it's an interesting thought—having a platform or brand can be better for business overall.

Polly: It's interesting when you're talking about influencers because that business we looked at—a digital marketing agency very niche to women's-only businesses. She'd done an amazing job; numbers were really good. But she was it—she was the face. The two people who worked for her had incredibly strong connections with her. We were like, this is a great business, but it's her. If she goes away, what's that gonna look like?

Athena: I wonder if we're looking at an age where—because we've seen at least three, four of these examples—this will become a bigger problem. At the same time, we're getting slicker with AI. I wonder if we’re going to be in a Black Mirror scenario where if people want to sell, they also need to sign over their likeness—like athletes with name and likeness—so you can have an AI continue to generate content and run their channels, but it's not actually them.

Justin: Yeah, not a lot. It's a weird future we live in.

Athena: I know. I've been obsessed with AI lately—binging podcasts from thought leaders on where it's going. Anyways, I've kept you a few minutes late—good stuff. We'll catch up with all of you tomorrow. Gil, I know we didn't get a chance to dive deep—are you away tomorrow or was that last week?

Gil: I am totally—yes.

Athena: Okay. Have a good trip then. Oh, let me plug Thursday: John Cipher, the author of Output Thinking, is gonna be with us on Thursday. I actually saw him speak at S and Bash a year, two years ago. Really amazing—former business owner and business coach—on how to go from operator to owner of a business and has some cool processes and things. One of the things he helps with is the transition into business ownership when you acquire a business. He’s doing a talk/presentation and conversation on "Are you ready to be an owner?"—things to think about going through this process, how to think about ownership, how to prepare. It's the first time we've had an author on—pretty exciting. Peter said he's actually reading his book right now.

Please join on Thursday if you can. He'll give a nice talk and there'll be plenty of time for Q&A. He charges a ton of money to do consulting, so we get to pick his brain for free. Please join us on Thursday if you're around—that's gonna be a great one.

Cool. Great to see you all. See you tomorrow—some of you. Gil, have a good trip. Hopefully see you on Thursday if you're around. Have a great evening. I'll talk to you soon. Bye.
