[Error #1 - Category: Entity name]
Location: ~00:00:35 / Speaker: Athena
Transcript excerpt: "This is Renata Cortez, who I now consider a dear friend. He's been a huge supporter..."
Issue: First name appears as “Renata,” but the guest is referred to as “Renan” throughout.
Likely intended: "Renan Cortez"
Confidence: High
Reasoning: Subsequent references consistently use “Renan,” and the guest self-identifies as Renan.
Impact: Medium - could confuse identity early on

---
[Error #2 - Category: Business terminology distortion]
Location: ~00:08:00 / Speaker: Renan
Transcript excerpt: "I got approved SBA and this is at a time before all the interest rates..."
Issue: “SBA” used without “loan,” creating ambiguity; later also says “SBA alone.”
Likely intended: "I got approved for an SBA loan"
Confidence: High
Reasoning: In acquisition financing, SBA almost always refers to an SBA loan; “alone” appears as a homophone error.
Impact: Medium - may confuse readers unfamiliar with SBA context

Location: ~00:27:10 / Speaker: Renan
Transcript excerpt: "kind of like a SurPro or Paul Davis."

Location: ~00:27:40 / Speaker: Renan
Transcript excerpt: "we ended up going with a system called Accelerate."
Issue: Restoration platform name likely misspelled/misheard.

Impact: Low - does not impede understanding but misidentifies vendor

Location: ~00:05:50 and ~00:09:00 / Speakers: Athena, Renan
Transcript excerpt: 
- Athena: "100 percent seller financing on an 8 million acquisition..."
- Renan: "it was an 8. 6 million business."
Issue: Purchase price alternates between $8M and $8.6M; later his calculator shows $8M financed.
Likely intended: Either $8.0M or $8.6M consistently; calculator example uses $8.0M.
Confidence: Medium
Reasoning: Multiple figures cited; could be rounding vs. specific. Flag for clarification.
Impact: Medium - affects deal economics discussion

---
[Error #6 - Category: Omission/Truncation]
Location: ~00:29:25 / Speaker: Renan
Transcript excerpt: "we had APA's drawn up for him all Barlow and, uh, and, you know, Bill Barlow."
Issue: Garbled phrasing; entities and prepositions unclear.
Likely intended: "we had APAs drawn up [by/from] Bill Barlow..."

Location: ~00:17:40 / Speaker: Renan
Transcript excerpt: "It's hilarious. It's I've been doing this two and a half months and they're like, we're super interested."
Issue: “Two and a half months” conflicts with earlier/later timeline (ownership ~2 years).
Likely intended: "two and a half years"
Confidence: Medium
Reasoning: He references two years of ownership elsewhere; 2.5 months is unlikely in this context.
Impact: Low - minor timeline confusion

---
[Error #8 - Category: Homophone/Misheard word]
Location: ~00:21:05 / Speakers: Renan, Athena
Transcript excerpt: 
- Renan: "I'm sorry. Is this a clean pocket? I don't know."
- Athena: "Yeah. Yeah. It costs all the time."
Issue: “clean pocket” and “costs” are likely mishears in a profanity context.
Likely intended: "clean podcast" / "I/we cuss all the time"
Confidence: High
Reasoning: They proceed to acknowledge swearing; “podcast/cuss” fits context.
Impact: Low - minor clarity

---

Location: ~01:01:35 / Speaker: Athena

Location: ~01:05:40 / Speaker: Renan

Issue: “USA” likely misheard for “USAA”; also awkward with NJM.

Confidence: Medium
Reasoning: USAA is a major insurer; NJM (New Jersey Manufacturers) is accurate. “USA for NJM” is semantically odd.
Impact: Medium - insurer relationships matter operationally

---

Location: ~01:02:40 / Speaker: Renan
Transcript excerpt: "I'm getting my company is a preferred restoration for 4 dicks in New Jersey."
Issue: “4 dicks” is almost certainly misheard.
Likely intended: Possibly "four districts" or "four Dick's [Sporting Goods] stores"
Confidence: Medium
Reasoning: In context of chambers/contracts, “districts” or a named chain are plausible; “dicks” is inappropriate and unlikely intended.
Impact: High - offensive/incorrect; changes meaning significantly

Patterns/Notes for ASR Improvement:
- Consistent confusion of common business/finance terms (loan vs. alone; podcast vs. pocket).
- Multiple proper noun errors in brands and entities (SERVPRO, Xcelerate, Lennar, USAA, BNI, Saquon Barkley).
- Occasional numeric/timeline drift (8 vs 8.6 million; 2.5 months vs years).
- Inappropriate homophone substitution (“4 dicks”)—high priority to filter/correct such cases.

Speaker Attribution:
- Speakers generally correctly labeled. No clear instances where Q/A roles appear swapped.

Cross-Reference Consistency:
- EBITDA and price references vary; recommend confirming final agreed purchase price (8.0 vs 8.6M) for accuracy.
- Calculator demo shows $8M principal and 12-year/7% example; aligns with narrative of seller-financed structure.

Context Preservation:
- Recommended removals are brief and do not interrupt narrative flow.
- Borderline segments are recommended to keep due to strong educational value and ties to business operations/leadership.
