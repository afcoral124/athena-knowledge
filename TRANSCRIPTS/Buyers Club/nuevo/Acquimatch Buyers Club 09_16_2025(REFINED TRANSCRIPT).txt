Athena: Hello? Hello.

[00:01:00]
Athena: Oh, looks like Michael dove off, but what I was hoping to touch on was Justin—wanted to check in with you real quick since you’ve got a couple opportunities, see how that's going. Um, Steve, same with you—was gonna check in with you and then Michael, have a conversation. Um, he's negotiating an LOI—there's a working capital discussion, which is great learnings for everybody. Here he is. If you wanna let him back in. Looks like we lost him for a second. Um, so cool. Michael, we got you back. I was just saying, uh, you're gonna be third on deck so we can chat through working capital and negotiating an LOI, uh, which is fun stuff when that comes up. So, um, first of all, Justin, uh, you've got two potential opportunities right now. So curious if there's any update on Hometown since we've last chatted.

Justin: Yeah. Not, uh, sub—nothing substantial. I'm working to get a little clarification on some of the financials. Um, they—the broker sent me the last few months, which I did not have tacked onto the kind of document, which was a, a, a live trailing doc with all of the years. The question I had was when he sent that to me, I looked back at, at 2024, 2023, and some of their numbers changed—revenue, expenses and whatnot. And I was like, why would other years have changed if you're just adding on a few years? So I asked about that just to get clarification. Um, and he said it was pulled directly just from the, you know, QuickBooks or whatever software he's using, but that he would find out and get back to me. So I'm waiting on that. Then, uh, otherwise just updating modeling and trying to, you know, see what the package looks like, uh, with the updated, uh, input.

Athena: Um, do you know if they've filed taxes yet?

Justin: I, that's exactly—I don't, and I was, I thought that that could easily explain it. If they hadn't filed and then did file ‘24, for example, and then that locked it in. Um, I don't know why that would've affected ‘23 though. So, I'm, uh, I'm, uh, TBD; we'll, we'll find out what's going on.

Athena: Right. Um, unless there's, like, uh, accrual or project updates or whatever ones. If they only have the accountant give it a once‑over once a year, yeah, ‘24 can impact ‘23. So, um. Okay. So the ball's in your court on that one—or you're waiting for them to get you an answer on the financials?

Justin: Waiting on them to get me, yeah, the answer on the financials there. Uh, and then I'm just kind of tooling with the, uh, the modeling and, uh, given what I know—assuming there aren't any, you know, substantive changes—just seeing what the numbers look like.

Athena: Okay. Awesome. And then you've got an off‑market call on Friday, so how are you feeling about that? Yeah, any strategy going into it? It's a little bit of a different flavor ‘cause you're playing broker and buyer when it's off market.

Justin: Yeah. Yeah. Uh, I mean, I, I don't know if I have a, a, a notable change versus just understanding more about the business. You know, obviously, you know, curious to hear more specifically around the—some of the financials and line items there. Um. Really just get a, a, an introduction. Let him get a read on me, get a read on him, and just, you know, meet to see if we're compatible from a—perfect, you know, transition period, that kind of thing. Um, but I, I mean, this is—I, I'm interested in the category because it is kind of tangentially related to real—related to real estate. It's a software product, which I'm very familiar with software. It sounded like enterprise sales was, like, a growth potential, and that's exactly what I've been doing for years. Mm‑hmm. So seems like this could be a, an interesting fit if we can put the puzzle pieces together.

Athena: Yeah. Um, and like super interesting business too. It feels like he's, he's carved out something very interesting. So, um, yeah. The—and, and that's exactly it. So, you know when, when it's an off‑market one, uh, there isn't a broker in the mix, so you do have the benefit of being able to slow‑roll the relationship and build the relationship from a good foundation. So first meeting is really like, kind of blind date, you know? Yeah. Like—yeah, which is weird. I guess it's like a blind date, but you've had all the profiles, so it literally is like a, you know, matchmaker introduction. It's like, well, we've gotten each other's profiles, but like, do we actually like each other kind of thing? Um, so yeah, we can, we can talk a little more deeply on, on strategy tomorrow, but I think it's, it's helpful for everyone to hear when you're in the off‑market situation. You don't have the pressure of a broker being like, make an offer now. You know, so you can, you can build that relationship with the seller, um, which ends up, you know, creating just a much better place to negotiate from. When you get to the LOI stage and, you know, you really are going through the relationship stages, there's an awesome document on your, um, deal resources platforms—like the stages of a relationship. Um, and it's kind of written as if it's off‑market. So, um, cool. Excited for you, Justin. Um, yeah. Excited about this one too.

Justin: Yeah. I'm interested to, to get some input on—I'm been running in some, uh, early modeling on it and, uh, wanted to get some input on that just to see if we can figure out something a little creative, you know, given that it is direct, and I don't know, maybe there's a potential outside of SBA together for something like this. So curious about that too.

Athena: I, I, I know this one very intimately, so—yeah, I do know a lot of—I, I have had conversations about this ‘cause, um, one of the fun things about this one is it's a Canadian entity and there are ways to get both SBA funding, um, and potentially private debt on, on these types of businesses, depending on how it's structured and, and, um, you know, brought over and that sort of thing. So, um. If, if, uh, if any of you ever come across—I can't—you know, this was a weird one because it was actually a direct referral from my, uh, so somebody that knew me, it was one of their clients. Um, they introduced us directly. So that's how this deal came about. And it happened to be a Canadian business. But there are ways with the SBA—some certain, uh, SBA lenders can take, uh, Canadian tax returns, reconcile it, as long as the entity is created in the US you are able to use SBA funding, but, um, the size of the deal, it might be able to unlock something else for you there too. Um, so cool. Send the financial models in advance if you can and then we can go through those all on our call tomorrow.

Justin: I'll send it. I also, a, a—confirmed it is in, uh, CAD, so—which was important distinction, uh, given the currency exchange. So everything comes down 25%, 27%. So it's good to know. Just note.

Athena: Um, which is interesting because all of his clients—uh, like 95% of the clients are U.S. Yeah. So he's taking, yeah, so he's taking money in U.S. dollars, converting it to Canadian, and then going back that way. So you'll be able to like, you know, um, remove the, the currency exchange as well.

Justin: Yeah. It'll be easier going the other direction. Yeah. Right.

Athena: Awesome. Cool. I'm excited to dive deeper in this one. Uh, anything else that would be helpful to you before tomorrow? Like while you're working on financial modeling or anything?

Justin: Uh, I don't think so. Yeah.

Athena: Cool. Good stuff. Exciting. 

[00:08:35]
Athena: I wanted to spotlight you guys ‘cause I haven't had a chance to pull you in in a minute. Sounds like there's like two potential things that you're looking at right now. So—yeah,

Steve: There's a few things going on. Uh, Polly can't make the call today. Sorry about that. But, um, I'm filling in for the boss. As far as—yeah. Yeah. So speaking of which, uh, you talking about no pressure on getting an LOI and we're working on one. I know. You know, uh, we spoke with Cash yesterday about—uh, yesterday or today, I don't even remember what day it is of the week. So it was yesterday that, uh, the broker was saying, Hey, we got an offer already out there. We're highly considered. Uh, you know, we'll, we'll—I'll get you the meeting with the owner. But you're gonna have to come right back with an LOI—that you can't wait on it. And that broker has since ghosted us since. So Polly's probably on some stalker list at this point. She's been stalking all weekend. Uh, emails, phone calls, texts. Uh. Yesterday after we spoke with Cash, it was, it was like, okay, now it's a mission. Now, you know, I don't, I don't really take kindly to this, uh, you know, being blown off. Uh, so she's been trying still to this point, and I just said, I'm—I am not gonna put in an LOI without talking to the, the owner. I mean, if it, if it is that difficult just to get the owner on the phone now, uh, I think if we, if we just blindly do it—just based on the, the SIM, and there's a lot of information on the SIM, but still, if, if that's the case, I, I just feel psychologically there's—it's gonna be hard to, to work together. So, um, and there's, there's a lot of questions we still have on some of the drop‑off in the revenue, et cetera. And just wanna understand what's going on. Like is there something fundamental that's changed? Did you lose a specific customer? Uh, are the financials beyond that better? Just some conversation, understanding what's going on with the business, not, not necessarily a micro inspection, just a, a feeling—you know, what do you think's going on and, and where are we headed to now? So just a conversation to hear a voice, and it just—it is just kind of strange. The, the one thing I think that's a little bit against us right now is that the other group is in that industry already—that's, that's bidding on it. So I think that buyer preference thing might be coming in and saying, Hey, you got somebody who understands your business. This is a slam dunk. Easy. I don't know. Everything I've read and heard and podcasted out there said, yeah, they make it sound like it's gonna be easier when it's somebody—it's a known entity. Sometimes it's 10 times worse. So, um, but that's where we are. Can't—I can't—we can't do anything until—we can't even get the broker to acknowledge us at this point.

Athena: Was that—is this the dumpster one?

Steve: Yes.

Athena: Yeah. Okay. Um. So, I don't know—Cash, if you, uh, uh, offered it already, but it might be worth you checking in on your end with the broker too, to see if she can give you some color. But usually, Steve, if they already had an offer and the broker's ghosting, it's because they're working that other offer and she doesn't wanna come back to you until—so it might just be that it's quite far down the line with that one. And she's keeping you warm while keeping you on ice kind of thing.

Steve: Yep. But no, no, no. It's, uh—uh, so yes, so that's in the works. Uh, I intend to have a much deeper discussion with Cash tomorrow. On the other one we're working on, uh, which is that, uh, crypto site. Uh, actually did speak with the owner of the company. Um, interesting guy. We, we had a really long, in‑depth conversation. Um, uh, as far—you know, from—it sounds reasonable. Just need to put together something. It's another one that—man, they, they valued it on 12 months’ worth of revenue, but three‑quarters of the revenue came in 6 to 12 months ago. The last six months, only a third of the revenue came in. And I'm just trying to understand the seasonality piece of it. Uh, you know, the—you know, even in the SIM, it talks about, well, yeah, a lot of times with the crypto market—I'm like, crypto's been nothing but booming. I don't understand why. So we, we had this discussion. He says it's coming back. I'll, you know, it's one of those—okay. Is it worth putting something together? I think so. Uh, we just gotta figure out the right mix. So, uh, whether—oh, and interestingly enough. Uh, you know, for anybody who has or has not experienced this, the broker told me, bar none, he is, um, not willing to do a, uh, any kind of seller financing—this and that—just wants cash and that's it. I just asked him—I said, Hey, are you flexible to make this work? You know, it's, it's, it's a, you know, this could get interesting. It's not really—it’s qualified SBA, but with 30% finance. Like, how flexible are you? He said, no, I'll work with you. So just don't believe what the broker says.

Athena: Thank you. Also, like—the brokers have additional incentivization with their lending partners, right? They get referral fees. Also, how they get paid can—like depending on how they structure it with clients, they can, um, sometimes not get paid on the seller note portion. So like there are other things at play when it comes to the, the structuring and the incentivization. It's one of the things that I very much dislike about the brokering industry is they're incentivized by how much money that they get for a client as opposed to choosing the right person and making sure it's a fair offer. Um, and these lenders, uh, you know, it's typical—it's like 1%, but some can incentivize more. Um, and, you know, if they have a preferred lender or whatever. Like I, I think most of you know, I don't love, um, you all talking to the broker's preferred lender. It can be used against you and all sorts of stuff can go off the rails there. Um, but yeah. So—and yeah. Here's, here's the other thing too with, like, any portion of seller financing is when you—when, when it—maybe the broker is right and the owner said, absolutely not. Why the hell would I risk part of my retirement on somebody I've never met before? Then, when you develop a relationship with someone, you create that trust. You position yourself as, you know, somebody that they really see, uh, you know, valuing and entrusting their legacy to—then that becomes a different conversation, which is why I don't like having the seller financing conversation right off the bat because it's like, well, of course they wouldn't trust part of their retirement with somebody they never met before.

Steve: I positioned it too as the—in the spirit of making a deal work. Right. That was—it is not saying, Hey, will you do it? This is my term—these are my terms and this is what I'm looking for. It was more like, you know, this is—it's, it is got, you know, a little bit of—be a little bit complex in, in getting the deal done. Are you open or willing to get creative if we have to, to make it work? And that was—that was—I think I didn't really come after him. Also, I think the other piece too—he owns four more, um, call it digital properties—or three additional. He owned five originally. He sold one. This is—this—he hasn't had an LOI; it's been out there for three months at this point. So I think when—the longer it's out there, the more flexible you might become. Uh, and then the others—he hasn't sold. He's—he doesn't care which ones sell. He's just going to focus on the last one and, and just liquidate all the others. That's—that's what he—he says. Uh, parts of the reasons are, uh, yeah. I could tell he is probably in—in that age group. He's having his first child, his wife has been his, uh, call it salesperson who's kind of stepping out. They do travel to where they have all these types of international travel to these types of conventions and all that kinda stuff, which she can't do anymore. So I, I think, you know, at the end of the day, um, yeah, it's interesting enough to work on putting something together. I know, I think Polly was trying to muscle through some of the financials into the model earlier when I saw her, but yes. So—couple things. Um, and, uh, yeah, but it's, it's a, it's a—

Athena: Business type that you've been very interested in for a very long time. So if nothing else, also trying to get to an LOI stage so you can look more meaningfully under the hood at this business type and, and, you know, decide whether it's something you wanna—either this one looks very good and you wanna pursue it and/or you understand this industry, this business type much better from a, you know, financial perspective, an opportunity perspective. Um, go ahead, Steve.

Steve: No, I was gonna say it—you know, it's something—I understand the business. Um, I understand, you know, different facets. So, you know, we, we had some conversations about, uh, you know, just—like, he's got 52,000 subscribers on—on, you know, they send out a weekly update on what's going on. They haven't even tried to monetize that. Not, not even an ad in—in the—I'm like, what's your open rate? What's this and that, you know, that type of deal. And he started pulling up his dashboards and numbers. And, um, yeah, so I, I understand enough of the business to be dangerous. Uh, you know, we, we had conversations around traffic flow and trying to understand what—what—why did it drop so significantly when—and he says the traffic flow really hasn't, so something is going on.

Athena: Mm‑hmm.

Steve: But, you know, there—there—that something could be opportunity too. So I'm not—it, it doesn't make me super nervous if we structure it the right way. Um, because they, they've got relationships with some of the top folks. Um, that is hard to get into as far as, you know, where, where they're getting their payments from. Just that asset alone. Uh, he did tell me that, uh, he—they—he turned down an offer. Somebody offered him just for the URL—like 350 grand just for the URL, period, right? Not even the business. So there's stuff there. It's just a matter of—I think he doesn't really focus on it right now. Mm‑hmm. I don't care what anybody says about passive income—there is no such thing as passive income. You gotta pay attention to it. You know, the, the harder part, I guess—from a personal thing—is yes, I understand it pretty darn well. Uh, you know, this is not Polly's wheelhouse, so we gotta figure out how to make it work where, you know, what—what can be done and run without becoming a, a mini expert in that field. And I've got resources too that can help on—personal resources that could help on some of the traffic and, uh, you know, sales funnels and all that other stuff too. So, um, that—that it's, it's a—it is an interesting, uh—I expected a call to go worse than it did. I expected it to be kinda like, I'm—I got a line in the—Sandy was super nice. Very open about everything. Um, but even when I asked him—of the questions, he had to go look at the dashboards. I'm like, dude, this is your business. Are you—do you ever look at this? I'd be, at a minimum, looking at that basic data every week, but it sounds like he's just collecting a check right now on that.

Athena: Right. Um, so, uh, something for you, Steve, um—and anybody else that ends up, you know, deeply looking at like things that are involving internet marketing. Um, I'm very, uh, close with the founder of something out here in Austin called the Internet Marketing Party, and it was a community that was started 20 years ago. Um, he is a good friend, but like anyone who's anyone in internet marketing has, like, spoken at these events, is a part of his community. So like—you know, when you get further along in it, I can, like—depending on what knowledge gap that you have, I can ask him, like, who's the best person in this space. They also do, um, you know, events and kind of things to like, help you with your business and stuff. So, um. Appreciate that—but he's had Alex Hormozi speak there, you name it. Like he's had, he's had the greats as part of his community. Um, and actually he, uh, when I was raising my money, I asked him for help and he is the one that connected me, um, to my final investor that I didn't actually know, um, on that round. So he's, he's pretty well connected. So anyways, happy to—

Steve: We definitely, definitely appreciate it. I think we spoke about this too, but Polly's cousin is, uh—a co‑founder of one of the behemoths in that space right now.

Athena: Cool.

Steve: Yeah, so then it's, you know, like when—

Athena: I think sales funnel—

Steve: So—when you, when you look at something like this, then it's about making sure you have the right advisory—mm‑hmm—board, if you will, around you to—to make up for the knowledge gaps that you might have. Just like you all are doing it for, you know, the search, the due diligence, that sort of thing. We're getting the right people around us and we're stepping into a business where it's not our direct point of knowledge—like, how can we start thinking about building our advisory panel, board, et cetera, um, when we go into it.

Athena: Yeah.

Steve: And just, just for a point of, uh, interest—just since we're on that topic, just for everybody else too, uh, because I was around that for a while pretty closely and got to see a lot of behind the scenes, but the idea—even in the digital world—the idea of, you know, um, you know—was it, uh, Buy Then Build?—is so much better than building from scratch. It is not—there is no panacea. It's not easy. I watch people trying to build good ideas, but there's so much—once you have—that's why I'm looking at this industry saying the traffic flow's there, relationships there with—connected to, uh, financial side of it. It's, it's proven to have done some business. It's, you know, there's, you know—taking that and building on that is so much easier than saying, that's a great idea, let me go try to build, you know, a pack with AI and some programmers. I can build a copy of the site and do it. But, uh, there—there's some, there's some good relationships there already, so that's why it's interesting.

Athena: Awesome. Cool. Excited for you. Um, well, good stuff. And I, I know you've got, um, some time with Cash, but anything else that would be helpful for you at this stage on these?

Steve: No, I think we're good. I think we just need to just kinda get inside that—that brain of Cash's to—to kind of keep me honest.

Athena: There's some things you don't want, Steve. I'll keep you out of that as much as I can. I'll give good parts. Uh, no, I'm looking forward. We'll, we'll dive in on Wednesday and we'll get you everything you need.

Steve: Yep. Thank you.

Athena: Um, awesome. Okay. Uh, so Michael—wanted to, um, have a discussion with you. So you're, you're having the fun of negotiating an LOI. Uh, the working capital discussion has come up, so I wanted to talk through that, kind of see, see where you're at, um, and then talk through some of the options as far as, uh, negotiation strategy going forward with where you're at. So, um, I've—I've gotten up to speed with the kind of financials and the, the email, but if you wanna just kind of bring us up to speed on where you're at right now. Um, sure—how, how we can help kind of move it forward.

[00:24:10]
Michael: So, um, you're right. I submitted an LOI, I stuck to the traditional template language saying that, you know, working capital will be determined during due diligence and confirmed by, I guess, me—the buyer, right? So the standard language. The broker, um, came back and said, well, we'd want to put a—they wanna peg a number to it, and I kind of knew—well, I thought I knew, but it turns out I was right—kind of thought where we were headed. Like, all right, well, according to our template, you know, like, you'd like us try to put a range, right? And then it was amount estimating, um, that range. So I replied back and—long story short—replied back to him with a range. Um, and he's come back and replied and, and said, wow, that seems really high. And then he almost answered the question about working capital, which he could have led with, right? He goes, well, it shouldn't be much more than this, because it's just all the things I knew. But it was a SaaS company. There's no annual prepays, there's no inventory, there's no A/R, right? So working capital for the operations of a SaaS company is relatively straightforward. Um, and so—or, uh, compared to more complicated working capital structures, I should say, in a complicated topic, it's one of the more straightforward ones. And so when I went back and calculated working capital again, like I, I, I—I had given him kind of a—inflate is not the right word, but it—it is the word that fits, right. It was a higher number than I was expecting for anchoring purposes. And what I also did in that working capital was I included founder pay, which I knew they would take out, right? Founder—there's only four lines of expenses. They've got a small advertising cost, they have contractors and subcontractors for salary. They have founder pay, which it can exclude, and then other costs. Uh, on a monthly basis, the whole running operating expense might be 50 or 60 grand, but you take out founder pay and it's like 15 or 16 grand, right? The broker replied back with, wow, this should be 16,800 bucks. When I ran into my calculation and took it out, I was at 16,900 bucks. So we're aligned. Directionally, I'm not—now, I'll caveat that I'm not a working capital expert. I'm not a due diligence expert. There's a firm—intentionally plan to be hired. And so I still want to have that confirmation of—they're gonna look at it, they're gonna set the number, we'll determine whether that one month, two months, or three months of op—uh, sorry, wrong phrase—working capital is sufficient. Right. Uh, and then, and can go from there. So I think what I'll do—I mean, as far as understanding a number to provide, Athena, I think I've gotten past that. I think I'm—I think I'm also, because of the way the broker replied—I know how he did his calculation. I know where he got the numbers from. The only difference would be whether or not you treat it as a liability for the deferred payment. 'Cause SaaS is prepaid, right? So close in the middle of the month, you're gonna have deferred revenue or—that needs to be accounted for, right? So that still would need to be trued up, I guess. And so I can—I think I can probably say we're aligned directionally on that point. I still want to have the due diligence provider—the CPA, the QOE—or I'm sorry, the, um, quality of earnings provider—um, verify that. You got my acronyms ma—messed up, I apologize. But anyway—

Athena: It's all good.

Michael: Anyway, I have them confirm that and go on. Right. The, uh, the good news is on the reply back, he's, uh—it was—they're, they're good with cash at closing. They're good with the seller note injected, full standby. Um, and then he—I've told you the update on working capital. The fourth point being where we're just not close is the seller—the, the performance‑based seller note, right? And so the terms that I had put forth, um, he completely altered those and countered with something different. And so it's not—it's, it's more favorable than his—to him than it is to me. Um, and I could, I guess I could go over that in a little bit, but basically what they said was—the revenue target in—what if—if you set that at, um, trailing 12 months and I think it was 2.1 million—if that drops 20% or more, then they'll start the forgiveness of the per—of the, of the performance note. And I was thinking to myself, that's not anything close to what I proposed. So there's the disconnect. That's where the negotiation, I think, is going—I mean, assuming that we'll get there at working capital—but I think the bigger, um, obstacle here is, alright, coming to terms on the performance note, right? So that's a pretty big value—excuse me. I think that's a pretty big difference in valuation. Um, on that—it's $170,000 on the performance note itself. It's also a 20% drop in total revenue, which takes it roughly from 2.1 million revenue to around 1.7. Uh, you're really—you're significantly changing—like I said earlier, uh, the valuation differences are there. Yeah. Um, so it's just about, uh, coming to—long story short, if we come to an agreement on something that works for both parties on the performance note, we could probably get under LOI.

Athena: Okay—

Michael: Cool. Pause there. So, um—wanna take a drink? Excuse me. Just—

Athena: Just some, some concepts around, uh, working capital, and—and I like to use these moments both for you but also for the benefit of everybody to kind of learn through you too. So, um, actually before I even get into that—your communications with 'em have been really awesome. So I just want to commend you on that. I know it's like first time negotiating an LOI, especially when it's like I'm learning while I'm doing this—like I think you've been doing very well. So well done on that.

Michael: Thanks.

Athena: And the broker's using terms that I haven't even heard before, so that's fun. Um, but you're doing really great. So—well done there. Um. Then, you know, when you submit an LOI, it's basically like, here's—here's my starting point. It's very, very rarely that I see somebody just sign an LOI without negotiating the points that are in there. The performance‑based note usually ends up being the biggest point of contention, but also working capital. So the reason why we put a—like, the reason why we don't put a number in the LOI—because if you put a number in, then that usually ends up being the number that they get stuck on post‑LOI, regardless of what comes back in the Q of E, which is why we want to try to avoid giving a number. Um, when you were calculating it, were you originally including the cash in the bank account? Because I was looking at the calculations and it—it looked like it was pretty high. There was, like, 170—

Michael: Well—sorry. Yes, I know what you're talking about. The answer is no, I didn't.

Athena: Okay.

Michael: Because it's, um, it's a, it's a super high number. Right. And, um, because—I, I think I just took it out because it, it really wasn't—I didn't think it was material to the business. There's no work in progress. It's not like a construction company that's going to have, like, a large cash on hand balance. Every—every 30 days, these guys are hitting somebody's credit card and the revenue's rolling in, so your, your window to survive—it's 30, 31 days. So I think—

Athena: Working capital actually has a, a calculation to it, right?

Michael: Yeah, yeah. Current assets minus current liabilities off the bat. I know, I know the calculation, but I thought with—

Athena: With—

Michael: With, with—

Athena: Hang on. Um, so you're correct, but also it's removing any cash. So it's current assets minus current liabilities, removing cash in the bank account, and also accounting for inventory on hand. Mm‑hmm. Um, so—

Michael: Well I may have missed that then, but—

Athena: That's, that's why I wanted to—like, it's not—not to call you out, you're doing really well, but—no, it's—working capital is one of those things that's like an absolute like, ah. Uh, so it's a good teaching moment. Um, when—when you're looking at a business, the biggest thing that you wanna determine is when do they get paid by the customer? Right. Like, so when they—when they—when they—when a customer says, yes, I am going to pay you money, is there a delay between that or do they collect cash immediately?

Michael: Sorry, is that—if that's to me—that they're collecting it immediately. Yeah. Or—

Athena: Yeah, exactly. So—so there's no delay between when they collect cash—or when, when a—when a person says that they're gonna pay them money, and when they actually collect that cash. Um, do they have, uh, like liabilities in terms of—do they prepay for things that, um—you know, or do they—do they get payment terms where they delay the amount of time that they pay someone, or do they pay someone when they get the bill?

Michael: That's unknown. Right? Because I don't have that detail.

Athena: So it's hard for you to determine working capital at this point, right? Because you don't have, right—A/R, A/P. You don't have a line of sight on what the amount of time is between, um, when cash is promised and collected and when cash is promised and paid. So that's why we don't determine working capital before LOI—is because you don't have enough information to actually be able to determine that. Um, so I don't love giving a number pre‑LOI if you don't have to unless they're willing to give you A/P, A/R, um, so you can kind of see what that cash conversion cycle is. 'Cause really where working capital comes into account is like project‑based work or—let's say, okay, I'm a—Justin, I'm just thinking roofing off the top of my head—I'm a roofing company. I'm gonna bill this comp—client $10,000 for this project, but I'm not actually gonna be paid for this project until I deliver the work four months later. And depending on their accounting practices and how they book it, and if they're accrual‑ish or whatever, then the accountants that know what they're doing go in there, look at everything, and they're like, oh, it's landing on their books, it's saying it's revenue that they received, but it's not actually recognized revenue—so you as the new owner are gonna have to fund that four‑month project, right, before you actually receive the payment. So you should—you, you need that money to keep the business open while you're waiting for the cash to hit your bank account. But since you're getting payments immediately from the customer, there usually isn't a huge working capital requirement, which is awesome. So now you need to understand—is there anything on their end that they're making promises to people but then delaying when they pay them to make their cash flow look better. Um. So we don't usually get access to that kind of information pre‑LOI, which is why we intentionally leave it generic on the LOI—that we're gonna figure it out and agree it afterwards and there's gonna be a Q of E report, et cetera, et cetera. Um, on this point, and when you're doing negotiations with the LOI, this is when I would usually get the lawyers involved and have them also advising you on any adjustments to the LOI language, so that template's really solid on its own, but as soon as people start redlining and making adjustments, you also wanna have them in your back pocket reviewing those adjustments before you agree to them, um, to make sure like they're calling out anything that could be a liability to you, um, in, in the agreeance to working capital usually ends up being one of those things that you wanna leave it intentionally vague because you just don't have the information to make a determination of what that is. But if the broker is insistent on agreeing to a number, then you agree to a number with the huge caveat that you are having a Q of E—there will be a report done and that number could and probably will change once that report is done. So as long—you know, like, from my perspective, I don't wanna give a number ‘cause I don't have the information to give a number. If you're making me give a number, I'm gonna tell you this is a made‑up number. Um, so just so you know, this is a made‑up number at this point until, you know, the folks do the reporting and we get a real view of what's going on with the working capital, and you're aware that it will likely be adjusted after we do that. So as long as you get them to be like, yep, we understand that—you know, what they're trying to avoid is you then coming in and being like, I want $500,000 of working capital. And they're like, what? Where did that come from? Because that will obviously come out of, you know, what they're taking from accounts payable and what they're taking in the deal. Does that all make sense?

Michael: Absolutely. Yeah. Um, I think that was similar to the response—not exactly, but I think it was like—because I, when I gave them a, um, a, a range, it was, it was a pretty big number, um, uh, you know—closer to total monthly revenue, right? Or—or higher. Um, so I did—I mean, without, without, without knowing the detail which you've outlined. Right. I, I did the best I could to mitigate a, a future risk and, um, and, and setting their expectations on a lower number. But, um, I, I, I think there—I won't be putting together, uh, a revised clause that doesn't have—that will be confirmed in due diligence and verified by me. It's just, you know, it's just how realistic do they want to set this peg. So.

Athena: Um, yeah. I guess it's, uh, just, you know—if you, if you put it—if you put a number in it, they're gonna hold you to that number. So I'm just preparing you for that. So it's to your best interest to try to avoid putting a number in, right?

Michael: Yeah.

Athena: But they're gonna try to push for a number, so as long as you heavily caveat it with them—like, you know, that this could all change once we do our due diligence—and get them to be like, yep, we understand that you're gonna do your due diligence and the working capital number cannot be meaningfully calculated before you have access to all the documents to help you understand that.

Michael: Yep.

Athena: Cool. Um, okay, so on the performance note bit—what, like—what conversations did you have with them about the performance note? Because my, my interpretation, just seeing his, his, uh, counterpoint on it was that he didn't fully understand the performance note. So did you have a discussion? Did it just go over in the LOI—like, where do you think their—do you think they grasped where you were going with the performance note?

Michael: Um, I, I think—no, I think he did grasp it. Um, um, I may not have, um, explained it here quite as eloquently as I should have, but I—what I told him before the—before presenting the LOI was—I said, um, Hey, you know, the—the seller had mentioned—he had mentioned that, um, you know, he was, you know, willing to do, uh, an earnout. And I said, look, with an SBA I can't really do it with an earnout. I can do it a different way. And then we got into, you know, the performance note considerations, right. And I mentioned—just like I have to peg it back to a prior year historical number, right—off of revenue, probably. And that's what we chose as revenue. And so when I put that number—when I presented that, uh, he basically just countered. And, um, my offer—that said, uh, my—the gist of mine was: if the revenue target isn't hit, 1% of revenue will be a 1%—um, um—forgiveness of the note, right? He basically said for—if we don't hit—if we get to the—if we don't hit the target, uh, up to 20% of a revenue loss, then the note is forgiven. And I was like, no, that's—I mean, he was basically—he's going to—the revenue could decline 19% and yet 100% of his performance note could still be paid—that's what he countered with in full. And so that's where we're just at a difference on the terms of the performance note. So I think he understood what I was saying. He just tried to counter with something that was more beneficial to him—to the, to the seller.

Athena: So the cash at closing you proposed was on the basis of them including that performance note to incentivize the growth. Right? So like, if you remove the performance note completely, how do you feel about the deal if they're—if they just get the cash at close and that—that standby of the 5%, I think it was.

Michael: How do I feel? Uh, no—I think that, I mean, financially, I think that's fine. Right. Um, it makes the total purchase price—you're reducing $856,000 off the total price, changing your entire valuation of the company. Right?

Athena: Right. So, are you willing to—like, or do you wanna hold fast on that then? Like the, the performance note portion is to incentivize growth, not an additional seller note.

Michael: Well, what I did was I put in a revenue floor—like I just don't want the company to get worse. Right. And so if the company—I mean, with—it grows, everything financially just gets better, right? Ev—all the DSCR—that cover—all of it, right? Just gets better. Um, but it—but the real protection here is, in my mind, is not having the com—the company to continue to decline, right? Um, he knows it's declining, he's acknowledged it, it shows up in the financials. It's pretty obvious. The question is between now and close, how much does it decline? And every, every—in one sense, every dollar amount that it declines is a dollar amount I'm overpaying, right, on the same valuation. So we can—the—so yeah, the, the performance note is a pretty big important consideration, right? It's based off of this—this much revenue and this much, uh, you know, SDE, right? If that—if that slides 10 or 15%, the offer's not right. Yeah, you're outta balance with what the original offer was based on the mo—uh, based on the financials that they provided.

Athena: Right. So what—what do you think are the next steps here to resolve that? Because I—it doesn't feel like a point that you wanna—yeah, I, I would agree. Like, if it's a performance‑based note to protect against revenue further—rather, revenue decline. Right. Yeah.

Michael: And—

Athena: To incentivize growth then.

Michael: Right. I think—well—yeah, so you've got a good question. It's one that's kind of on my mind here, but I think one of the things is, um, I—I feel like I've put together an offer for them. I've kind of—I recognized what their needs are—it's like I've gotten them up above the threshold over—over cash at closing. You seem to acknowledge that. Um, I've—and, um—also, um, the other, um, I forgot the other pain point off the top of my head, but I felt like I put together an offer that was really, uh, uh, accept—you know, in—with—with keeping in mind what he was trying to get out of the—out of the company, right? The protection I want to protect now is, um, making sure that there—if revenue declines between whatever today is and closing date and the 12 months following that, that there's, um, a, a, a reduction in the—in the purchase price—or the performance note, in this case—that I—that compensates for that. Right? So I'm, I'm—my counter may be—because I may just say, Hey, I'll—I—he also asked for like, um, he wanted the terms to go from 10 years to five years. He was okay with the 5% interest rate. I, I really can't go to five years because the SBA's not gonna wanna shorten the term line off of the—before they—you know, they don't want the seller to get paid before they get paid. But I could probably convert it to, uh—he wanted to also go from a two‑year standby to a six‑month standby. Um, I could go to a one‑year standby because you need one year to—to measure the performance. Um, and so I can give you the one year instead of two. Um, I can't—I don't think I could do six months because you can't measure the performance. Right. But—and I could also say, um, there's another, you know, the, um, a, a—another small thing, right. But I'm not really planning to concede on watching the business decline between zero and 19% without some relief.

Athena: Yeah, that's—two things there. A little more on the Chris Voss approach. If the revenue continues to decline while you're in due diligence, like your team is gonna be looking at, like, what the most recent is and you'll probably retrade based on what the most current is. So just know that that's usually a thing that happens. Um. In terms of the—so the, the part that's on full standby can't get paid back before the bank. If you have this additional performance note, you're a little bit more flexible in terms—as long as the debt service coverage ratio works. So it depends on whether it's on standby and contributing to your equity contribution or not.

Michael: Okay.

Athena: Um, with the performance‑based note though, however—um, I remember in your original model—I haven't seen the most recent—were you doing this off year one, year two—you had like year one achieving this and year two achieving this?

Michael: Yeah.

Athena: So year one has a one‑year standby. Year two has essentially a two‑year standby because you need the first year to get that note starting to get paid. The second year needs two years before that part gets paid, correct? Um, what you could potentially do is amortize it over nine years and eight years, but do a five‑year balloon. So they get paid in five years. What I would do at this point, and Michael, I don't love negotiating over email, um, because it—it removes the opportunity to discuss what's important to them. So I might schedule a call with him at this point, um, to talk about your, you know, concerns are—the revenue's in decline—and trying to protect against the decline while also incentivizing to get some more growth there. Um, but that additional note—I'm not—you know, we can remove that entirely, right? Like, I'm comfortable with just having the 5% full standby and the rest of the deal as is. So I'm trying to do something that incentivizes and, you know, and is a win‑win for both of us. They get more money if they help me get the business back on track. Um, but I'm not willing to take additional risk with something that's already in decline. But I don't like doing that over email. I think it's a phone call and finding out, like, what's important at this point. You know, a performance note is—you—you've gone on mute, Michael.

Michael: Sorry. But I was saying I think that—I, I, I like that idea. Um, 'cause there's also the, the opportunity to talk to them about the working capital and it's like, hey, we're gonna put this number in and—but I'm gonna tell you that the due diligence part is what's gonna drive the number, right. So I can have that conversation as well. And I do think time—

Athena: Sorry—this could be one of those concession points too, since, since you included the cash on the original one is like you could come down on working capital pretty comfortably, I'd say, at this point—since they collect cash at—like at time of payment. Um, but say, okay—like is it important that he gets paid in five years? What about a balloon payment at year five? Um, you know, so like then it also seems like a concession—you're meeting in the middle, but what I would not concede on is the floor and the reason for this performance note. Right? It's like, Hey—

Michael: Oh yeah. I don't—I'm unfor—I, I just don't think that's—I think that might be as close to a non‑starter as I've gotten the whole deal. Right. So—right. I'm, I'm completely in agreement. Yeah.

Athena: In which case then—a conversation. 'Cause it seems like this broker's pretty open. I don't think there's been any other offers on this. So like, you know, hearing out what—what's important about this? Like, where did this come from? [00:49:00] Um, does, you know—does the owner anticipate even further loss going forward? I'm a little nervous about that, right? Um, and you can do a—this is an Elliott Holland thing. It's like, well, you know, I have this information. Let me sit with it—just put him on ice for a day and he might come back and—and, you know, oh, I talked to him and he did this, you know, because I, I don't think it's competitive right now. So you, you kind of have that in your back pocket also.

Michael: I think that's the case, I hope. Yeah, I, I, I—I'm, uh—the competitive part, right? I mean, things could change on a dime on that, but yeah, I think currently, um, I agree. That's sort of been my gut feeling on it, so, um. Um, yeah, I think at this point I can reach out to him and—and get, um, a call scheduled—is probably a better conversation to your point on that one. Uh, there's a couple of—but not just the performance note, but also working capital as well.

Athena: Yeah. And then—and then it looks like, you know, you're giving a little by, like, lowering from what your original offer is. A balloon is something that, you know, you can potentially look at. Um, that sometimes involves a refi with SBA or you just put some money aside every year from the cash flow to be able to do that. Um, but it buys you some time and it also helps your cash flow numbers in those first couple years—rather than amortizing it over five years, you amortize it over the—the eight and the nine and do a five‑year balloon. Um, as long as the debt service coverage still works and/or you plan to do a refi, that's usually what people do with the balloon. Um, okay, so, yeah. But I, I—hear about too, before—Michael, is like, Hey, so what's, what's in—you know, talk me through the discussion on the performance note. What's important here? How did they feel about it? You know, what was their feelings about getting the, the revenue up—the amounts that I, I put in place and getting us back to what happened in the past? And you might uncover—mm‑hmm—how they're feeling about that portion of the, the opportunity or that portion of the offer that you put in front of them.

Michael: Yeah, will do. That's good.

Athena: Good stuff. You're doing great. This is, this is—this is the—the like total nail‑biting part—is the, the LOI negotiation, so—

Michael: Oh, thanks.

[00:52:00]
Athena: Yeah. Good. Um, we'll post the replay too with the transcripts if you wanna revisit any of this point. And then you obviously have, um, Cash at the ready to kind of talk you through what happens when they come back to you. So, um, cool. It was fun. Got some exciting stuff happening and, uh, yeah, Michael, like I said—the, the navigating the broker combo on the LOI negotiation—you've been doing great with it. So fewer words the better, I think, and you've been mastering that, you know, so it's been good, but not overly explaining yourself, which actually makes you appear like a very competent buyer. So it—it was cool to read through that.

Michael: Thanks. I appreciate it.

Athena: No worries. Awesome. Well, good stuff. Great to see everyone. Thursday we have the return of Chris Barrett. I hope you really enjoyed—I enjoyed the conversation on financial statements last time. So he is gonna be coming back and breaking down accounting for business owners, uh, the different types of accounting, uh, what—what good looks like and what not good looks like. I think it helps you all wrap your head around what you're gonna need as a business owner and also understand what you're looking at from all of these business owners and probably what they've been doing. It is just confusingly something that is not, um, very well done—the bookkeeping, the accounting, the tax planning for business owners. So oftentimes, you know, when we're reviewing financials of these business owners, um, they didn't have super strong support team. So I think that conversation with Chris is gonna be awesome on Thursday. Um, we'll be back next Tuesday, but just a reminder, we are off the last Thursday of the month on Buyers Club. Usually everybody's kind of doing their month‑end stuff, so we give, give everyone that time back. So, uh, we'll see you next—uh oh. We'll see this Thursday. I time traveled for a minute there. Good stuff everyone. Talk to you soon. Bye.
