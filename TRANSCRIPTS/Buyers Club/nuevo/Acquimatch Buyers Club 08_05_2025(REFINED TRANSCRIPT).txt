Title: AcquiMatch Buyers Club
---

[00:00:01]
Athena: Very good, thanks. So good. Uh, wanted to introduce, uh, some of you met some of the faces, but, um, we've got a few new analysts on the team, Caris and Cash. Um, so wanted to bring them on to Buyers Club. You're gonna be seeing more of 'em. Um, but wanted to have them do a quick intro. So they're gonna be doing what? Um, Luke does and getting more, uh, deals vetted for you all. Um, we're all collaborating on them together, but they'll individually be working on stuff too. [00:01:00] So, um, super amazing backgrounds and, um, interesting stuff that they've had in the past. So Caris and Cash, can you do quick intros real quick? Say hi everyone.

Caris: Sure. Hi everybody. I'm Caris. Um, if you don't get my name right, it's totally okay. Um, Gil, you are my lucky client. I'm joining on your deal team. Um, so some background on myself. Um, I started M&A, um, back, uh, before I graduated from college. Actually, I was in my senior year. And my family owned a business out in McKinney, Texas. And, um, it came time to either, you know, close shop, my parents were looking to retire, and, um, I ended up helping them sell their business. Um, and then three months before graduation, um, I graduated from [00:02:00] UTD, um, with business and entrepreneurship. Um, I was recruited by a boutique M&A firm in Dallas, um, and we focused on sell-side M&A. So our bread and butter was one to 10 million EBITDA deals. Um, industry-agnostic, so service-based, um, medical even, um, really, uh, specialty, uh, businesses as well on the sell side. So, um, I did that for about five years. And then for the last five I've, I've been specializing in franchise advisory. Um, and, you know, I really just came to self-discovery of knowing that I missed independently owned private M&A deals. And so I found my way back here, uh, with AcquiMatch today.

Athena: And, um, super cool. Uh, I love the story of like deciding to help her parents sell her business in university. So that's one of my favorite fun facts about Caris. K, how [00:03:00] about you?

Cash: Yeah, excited to hop on and meet a little bit, uh, more of our clients here. I had the opportunity to connect with Polly last week, um, and her husband, but happy to meet you, Gil and Justin as well. Um, I'm down in Houston. I went to Texas A&M, got a degree in finance. Started, uh, a little bit more traditionally. I was a research analyst at an investment bank, uh, for a couple years covering oil and gas securities. Uh, I ended up starting my own yoga studio after that. That went on until about COVID when I, uh, had the opportunity to start working at a startup accelerator in Austin. Worked there for three years covering capital raising strategies, uh, deal flow and business development execution. Um, generally advising our clients on their growth strategies within the organization. Spent a little bit of [00:04:00] time at Startups.com after that, which is really good advisory firm, uh, again around capital raising, business development, and, uh, general startup support. So I have a background, everything ranging from public markets all the way up through private markets, and, um, just excited to jump on here and, and add value to the reports with the team and hopefully help get you guys the, the type of quality deal flow that's gonna give you the tools and the, the power to take the leap of faith and go out and act as your own operators.

Athena: Um, something that really excites us about Cash is all the experience that he's had, looking in small businesses, startup businesses, getting them ready to raise capital, and the valuation from that side. It's a lot of my background too, which is why I bring a different view into, uh, you know, looking at acquiring businesses because when you're starting and scaling something, there's certain things in place, but you know, from Caris' angle, having been on [00:05:00] the sell-side, so just bringing a lot more skill sets into the team for us all to collaborate and look at things kind of holistically and from different views. So we're super excited to have them join the team. Um, what that means is that we're also gonna be getting them more actively involved with you all. So you're gonna be seeing them on your weekly calls. So we can close that feedback loop and get more collaborative with you on, on the deals that we're sourcing and stuff. So. Um, super excited to have them on the team and excited for them to bring even more value to you all and the deals that we're sourcing for you. Um, might be worth actually. Um, Gil, Justin, Polly, if you don't mind just doing a quick intro, like they've, we've told them all about you, but better for them to just meet you directly.

Gil: Sure. I'll go. Um hmm. I. Uh, I'm based out of, uh, Hoboken, New Jersey, birthplace of Sinatra. [00:06:00] Um, we, uh, my, my experience is in corporate IT. I've been in the corporate IT for my entire career. Um, and uh, now I'm looking to buy business. I am an independent contractor these days doing, uh, contracts here and there for. Uh, interim CIO positions, interim IT, director of IT positions, things like that. But, uh, because I have a lot of time, uh, I pretty jump pretty fast on things you send me and, uh, things like that. So yeah, whatever you need on here.

Athena: Thanks, Gil.

Justin: Oh, do you wanna go or do you want me to go? Uh, you look muted. I'll go, uh, Justin here, based out of, uh, Austin, well, Leander, Texas technically, but, uh, just outside of Austin. Uh, I've worked in SaaS sales, enterprise sales to Fortune 500 C-Suite for better part of a [00:07:00] decade or more. Uh, owned small businesses a couple times. Um, one was an advertising agency based outta central Texas as well, and another is. Dorm, I say dormant. It's still active. I'm just not doing it, uh, full-time. But a real estate investment and development company, I'm big into real estate, uh, investment as an asset class. Um, yeah, I'm looking to get back in that entrepreneurial spirit, find a, a business to, to I can operate successfully and see where we can take it.

Athena: Amazing. Thanks

Polly: Justin. Okay, I'm last, um, I'm Polly and, um, my husband and I both are working with AcquiMatch to find our first business. My background is actually working for small businesses of different sizes. I started off in the commercial interior design business for re. And I made a career change in 1994, um, into the health and fitness industry, and I [00:08:00] actually worked for a couple of, um, commercial equipment manufacturers selling into health clubs and, uh, national account levels and so forth. Then I moved into a small business that was very niche marketed in the hospitality industry where we designed and equipped fitness centers. We were actually a distributor, um, and we were, we were, um, a vendor to all the major companies like Hilton and Marriott and so forth. So we help develop prototype fitness centers for all of their different sizes, hotels, and, uh, I worked national accounts. I did just some distributor channel, um, accounts and, uh, kind of wore different hats, project management, uh, turnkey packages from design through all the way through installation. So that gives you a little bit about my background and now we're looking to acquire our first business and, and hopefully we'll be able to find one soon. [00:09:00]

Athena: Yeah. Amazing. Thanks Polly. Um, on that note was curious where you've gotten to with Hive and IOI/LOI making an offer? How's that situation panning out? Do you wanna give us a quick overview?

Polly: Yeah, so at, at the, at this particular time, Steve and I are just trying to structure the deal. Um, there has been a, a pretty strong emphasis put on the fact that, um, this owner does not wanna do seller financing. Um, he's very interested in, you know, the earnout. It more in earnouts, and of course, you know, offering the best price, which would probably be the full price for the business. But we're just trying to figure out how to structure the, um, the deal. Uh, we have decided to do an IOI, um, I've had a couple of, well, I have one conversation, uh, lengthy conversation with the broker. I've exchanged emails with him and so forth. He's been very forthcoming and actually [00:10:00] very supportive in answering all my questions. The one thing that, um, he is doing though is gatekeeping, um, the seller from us right now, we have to submit, pretty much have to submit either an IOI or LOI before we can actually talk with the seller. And the, the, the business is a fairly complex business because it's home automation. So it's, it's your blinds that are on, you know, automation for your, your windows to the, you know, um. Networking in your home. I mean, it, it's linking a lot of different things together. He's doing a lot, he's selling a lot of products and services and it's a larger deal, so we feel like it's just really important to have that conversation with a seller. So we're not a hundred percent comfortable in submitting the LOI right now, even though we know there's, you know, some play around with the IOI, but. Just because we haven't been able to have that initial, [00:11:00] um, conversation with the seller to be able to ask some of the questions we really wanna ask. So yeah, we just put together, uh, the IOI, um, you know, do a quick structure on the deal and figure not quick, but we're trying to figure that out and submit that and just see what the next step is and see if he entertains that so we're able to actually have a conversation with him before we submit an LOI or move any further with it.

Athena: Um, so. Do you have an idea of what the other offers have been so far?

Polly: So as far as the offers in actual offering price, no. But the d but the, um, the broker did say he, he has had one IOI and LOI, another I. So two offers. So one is an IOI, one's an LOI, and that was rejected and he said he didn't give specifics as to why it was rejected. He kind of alluded to the fact that it wasn't, the price wasn't where it was supposed to be [00:12:00] though, so, and, and that seller o seller financing was a piece of both of the offers, which the seller doesn't want to do. And then, um, he said he had a couple of other LOIs that should be submitted this week, but he was gonna be waiting on that. So that's the information I got.

Athena: Okay. It sounds like he had some like, like. From what Luke was sharing that maybe he, he screwed up in the past and didn't gate keep enough, which is why he is trying to do that now. He's overcorrecting. Okay. Mm-hmm. Um, so when we were looking at it last week, it looked like there was a pretty awesome, like for like performance based forgivable note opportunity there mm-hmm with an IOI if, if the goal is to get through to the owner. Mm-hmm. Then I would, I would put it the highest that you're potentially [00:13:00] comfortable with, including the performance based note.

Polly: Okay. Okay. That's, we were thinking. So, I mean, I've gotten, I've got the LOI pretty, I mean the IOI pretty much filled out, you know, the actual, um, IOI itself, except for the compli, just the whole, um, structure of it right now. And so Steve and I, he's been really busy today. That's the reason why he's not on the call today. But as soon as we're done on this call, then we're gonna finish out structuring it and sending it over to the, to the broker. So I will, I'll pass that along. 'cause that's kind of what we were thinking. I mean, obviously the, the seller financing is not an option. Um, it, it's gonna be the earn out. So you're saying offering off, making an offer higher than probably what they're asking potentially, or at least at that offer price and then do a buyout? Is that what you're saying? I mean, buyout, earn is what I'm meant to say. [00:14:00]

Athena: Yeah, you gotta be careful with language too, right? 'cause earnouts are not allowable by SBA.

Polly: Okay?

Athena: So you can't use the term earnout. It has to be performance-based forgivable seller note, um, because you can't incentivize them to do better than they've done in the past, but you can incentivize them to get back to something that they've done in the past. So for the. For everybody else that's listening. There was a, a year, like two or three years ago where they did exceptionally better than they've done in recent years, um, in terms of revenue. So if we, you know, do a forgivable performance based note, which Gil's looking at a deal that has that component as well, then we can incentivize them to get back to performance achieved in the past, but no more. You can't ask them to like earn or to have revenue targets higher than what they've achieved in the past. [00:15:00] But we can set revenue targets that we wanted to get them to get back to that they have achieved in the past. And that's the only way we can do incentivization around growth using SBA. So when I see that like Spike in previous years, I get excited 'cause it opens up that performance note, forgivable performance note option. Okay. To get higher than the past, we can use forgivable performance based notes to just have the previous year's performance

Polly: uhhuh. Okay.

Athena: Right. But since you have that, like that, um, standout year, a couple years ago, then it's like, okay, if you get the revenue to, let's say it was 20, like in 2022, the revenue is 20% higher than it was in year to date. Mm-hmm. So like if you get 20% higher. Um, on 2024 numbers revenue, which is the same as what you achieved in 2022. Okay? Then I'll pay this amount of note, but it's only due if that is [00:16:00] achieved.

Polly: Okay? So there's

Athena: gonna be a cash at close component, which doesn't include that performance note. And then the forgivable performance based seller note. It's still a seller note, right? Mm-hmm. But it's probably gonna be a lot more money than he would be offered if it was just straight cash at close. Mm-hmm. Okay. But with the IOI, and this is like, I don't love IOI, as you guys have heard me har harp on about this. But if the purpose is we just wanna get access to the owner because we need a lot more information before we make an offer on it, then you wanna shoot kind of high, because that'll just open up the gate for you. And then once you get all the information, it's like, Hey, that was with no information. Now all this has come to light. We've adjusted our offer accordingly. You know.

Polly: Is there any, um, is it really our decision as far as like, as you were saying, what number we are comfortable with? Or do you, in other words, like if you're, if, if you're offering them the asking [00:17:00] price, they're asking price, is there a certain percentage that you kind of follow to go above that? Or is it just purely what we're comfortable with

Athena: this is, this is not like. Y'all need to do what you're comfortable with. But as a rule of thumb, if I'm asking them to increase the revenue by 20%, then I look at increasing the purchase price by 20%. Okay? And then what Delta was between what my asking? Price. Like do your asking price or purchase price as if there was no performance change? Right. So in a no change scenario, what would I pay if nothing changed in the business? And then, um, that's my, like, cash at close number minus the, you know, if you're gonna put in a portion of seller note, um, just straight seller note. But let's, let's say for example, you would've offered a million if there was no change in the revenue targets. Mm-hmm. [00:18:00] And that's what they could get cash at close is, well, I'll pay a million cash at close, but if you increase your revenue by 20%, I will pay you 1.2 million. 200,000 of which is a forgivable performance based note attached to you achieving that 20% revenue growth.

Polly: Okay.

Athena: But it's the, the amount that the actual note is for is gonna be different than the increase in the purchase price. You're gonna have to do the math between what is my cash-at-close number in a no-change scenario, and if they hit whatever revenue targets that I'm, I'm having them hit. The, do the numbers still work if I were to increase the purchase price, but usually that'll be enough to turn their head right, because it was a, it was like a dollar difference, I think, in their revenue, if I remember the numbers correctly. So that would be a pretty sizable chunk. And they'll just see purchase price, right? Like, ah, you know, but like 30, 40% of it, whatever is for forgiven, they still get their cash out [00:19:00] number that they might have gotten from somebody else, but they'll probably open the door to you. Because you're offering so much more that has a performance. If he's that, like, if he's okay with an earnout, he'll, he should be okay with a performance base forgivable amount too. That'll get him more money if, if the business achieves what you guys set out to achieve.

Polly: Mm-hmm. Okay. All right. I jotted all those notes down, so I'll pass that along

Athena: on the, on the IOI go to the top of your comfort level. Right. And then. If that'll open the door and then as you get more information, you might have to, you know, bring it down once you get the information that you have, but at least that'll open the gate.

Polly: Okay

Athena: to have access to the seller. You guys are very likable. There's so much between your backgrounds that is relevant to this business and if he is potentially looking at partnering with this business in the future, he is gonna want people running the business that he can partner with. So once you get access, that's your play, is to develop that relationship, pull [00:20:00] out your background and the history to get that kind of affinity and make him feel comfortable that you all together could achieve that performance.

Polly: Okay. Okay. Sounds good.

Athena: Cool. I'd get that out sooner than later so you can stay in the mix. 'cause I know you really like this one.

Polly: Yes. And, um, we were actually, like I said, gonna finish this up. Um, you know, as soon as we get off our call here and we'll run through the numbers here and submit something to him today because I did tell him I would get that over to him today.

Athena: Awesome. Cool. By this evening, do you have what you need for that? Have you any, any other. Questions or anything, or you feel good about how to put that together?

Polly: No, I think we're good. Um, we'll get, we'll get through that this, see what the response is and then we can talk to you about that tomorrow during our meeting.

Athena: Exciting. Cool. Amazing. Well, [00:21:00] so, okay, Gil, you've also got a live one. Have you heard any, so Gil's been negotiating on an LOI on something he's very interested in. So where are you at with that one?

Gil: I heard back about five minutes before this call started.

Athena: Oh, great.

Gil: Um. I need to reread his email because I'm not sure if he understood [00:22:00] how the forgivable seller note works. Uh, but now that I'm reading it again, I think he might have. So let let, let's talk about it tomorrow in our meeting. I'll show you what, I'll show you what he wrote. Um, I was only able to get, to build a sample today, uh, a, a sheet of, of what that is. Um, I'll share that with you tomorrow as well. Uh, but I don't wanna share it with him until I have a better understanding of does he understand what I'm talking about? Does he not understand what I'm talking about? So, uh, we'll take it from there. I always talk back to him tomorrow. It's no big deal. Um, yeah. But, uh, again, looks good.

Athena: Cool. So do you mind if I give everybody a little background on your, on this one? Of course. Um, so this is a seller who's selling directly and he bought the business in the past. So he is got some kind of experience buying the business, but instead of using a broker, he is doing it himself. So, um, Gil has [00:23:00] been, um, putting a, a. Option in front of him that has a forgivable performance-based seller note in it because he had, you know, one of those years in the past that was higher than current years. So it's been interesting for Gil to explain that scenario directly to the seller where there's not a broker involved to kind of, so Gil's having to act as like broker and buyer right now, even though this guy has previous experience, which I think maybe wasn't the best because he didn't include working capital in his deal when he bought it and that sort of thing. So he is like, well, work capital isn't included in mine. It's like, well that doesn't mean I should also do that. So, um, that's been good, but Gil had a good idea too. What was, do you wanna just share what you were thinking might've helped that conversation and what you put together?

Gil: We had a, uh, he countered and then I got on a call with him to talk about his counter and to offer him those two [00:24:00] options that were in front of him. Uh, did it on a call, not through email. And, um, during that call, I realized if I only had a chart on Excel sheet or a graphic or, or a graphic or something that could show the seller, uh, what actually the forgivable seller note is, how it works. It would've been much, much simpler. I would've, I, I would not been in, in the situation that I have, that I'm in right now. Um, so it just delays it by a few days, but a few days is a few days, you know? So, uh, I, I would've preferred to have that ready, uh, and learn my lesson, so, yeah. Next time.

Athena: But it's, it's still a good process to go through, right? Because even if, if he would've just signed it without understanding that, that's gonna come up down the line as an issue. And so like. I think you have a really good idea of like, maybe I could do some visuals to help him understand it and then maybe we can all benefit from that learning that you got of like how, what's the, because it's a [00:25:00] complicated concept, right? So it's the easiest way to get a seller to understand like, you do this much in revenue, you get this much, you do this much in revenue, you get this much, you know? So yeah, I'm excited to see what you come up with and maybe. You know, we can share the learnings with the group too once you happen on something there. 'cause it's a fairly complicated concept, especially when most sellers. Have never sold a business before. So even these, these ideas of like earnouts and stuff like that is foreign to them. Yeah. And then forgivable performance based seller notes are even less known. Right. So like, how do we explain that? Because it's to their benefit. If, if they, you know, if they're saying the business can get to a certain level, then like, okay, help me. So

Gil: yeah. It's also, um. It's over, it's also over two years, so it, it gets a little bit more complicated. The, the math gets a little bit more complicated, so. Yeah. We'll, we'll, we'll see. We'll talk, we'll talk about it tomorrow morning. [00:26:00]

Athena: Okay. Awesome. Can't wait for that. Thanks Gil.

Gil: Yep.

Athena: Um, so Justin, I haven't checked the channel today. Did you get news from hometown?

Justin: No, not yet. But that doesn't surprise me. Uh, I mean, I, I've been considering it probably gone until there's proof otherwise. Um, just based, now that I know what I know and based off of the history, I am fairly certain that my offer and the ongoing kind of back and forth has been used as. Increase offers and kind of use that a playing field for other opportunities. Um, and now knowing that they've got something else that is from a roofing company or roofing managers and that kind of thing, I just, I don't see a path forward. I certainly can't change my offer, can increase it in any capacity, just doesn't make financial [00:27:00] sense really by that point to keep extending myself. Um, so I kind of, what they have is what it is for me. Uh, and given the status, I just don't see that panning out. Um, and I, I think the broker knows that, and I think he liked me and he's a nice guy and so he's trying to, you know, not just drop the hammer and be like, you know, it's over. But he would've told me otherwise if it, uh, if it wasn't. So I'm kind of considering it lost until something tells me otherwise. I'm kind of putting my attention in, you know, other areas.

Athena: I'm really sorry. That's super frustrating. What, what gave me, it's that they were doing that

Justin: what, what gave me That they were using my offer. Oh. Just based on the fact that they never once had mentioned and any other offers in this latest month, six weeks, um, combined with the fact that actually the broker told me otherwise, that, that I was the choice. And then it was just around terms and figuring out how to [00:28:00] kind of iron out the details. So it's, uh, yeah, and I get it. And you know, the broker, again, he's, he is trying to do right by a seller and he's gotta do what the seller says that he told me. He is like, look, at the end of the day, like I only have so much persuasion, like it's his decision, but I get it. I mean, I don't, I don't fault him for it, but, um, I do think that. This has taken as long as it has because they were like trying to see if there was a bite from other parties and that kind of thing. It's the only thing that makes sense at this point. So yeah, just moving forward, trying to find the, the right, uh, the right opportunity. Um,

Athena: you said you were thinking about how to avoid having this happen again. Has anything come up for you or any learnings that you're, you're taking from this situation?

Justin: Yeah, a few. One is, I think, you know, barring the right circumstance, I'm gonna probably hold more to my LOI deadline. [00:29:00] Um. You know, I understand. And market parameters dictate that, you know, if it's a seller's market, they don't have to adhere to it, and that's fine. I think much like I do in my real estate, it's like, Hey, here's an offer and it's contingent on a deadline because I don't want them to shop my offer around and just kind of sit on it. I think I'll probably communicate that pretty concertedly, you know, when I'm submitting, uh, LOIs in the future. And that's not to force their hand just to. Get a decision process in motion. And if the answer is no, that's okay too, but this way I'm not burning four months, five months on something that, you know was never going to happen. Um, that's, that's a learning thing for me and something I, I implement in the real estate world, but I haven't implemented yet. That I think would help mitigate some of like that time lost.

Athena: Mm. Um. Yeah, I mean it's, it's, [00:30:00] it's interesting 'cause like those timelines, it's, you wanna create a sense of urgency and stuff, but you know. On Lindsay and Kevin's first deal, they were negotiating the LOI for four months before they got it signed too. So like it can sometimes take that time. So, um, I was wondering with, with the broker being as experienced as he was and specific in roofing, I was like, I wonder if it's dragging out because they're doing that. So

Justin: do you think could be, I mean, he, like the broker's completely distracted. I mean this, this is one very small piece to his. I mean, he's got very grand ideals for his business and this brokerage he's starting in, I mean, he's, he is, he wants to be a, a roofing broker mogul. And so one business of, uh, to put it in his terms, I, he said, I think 2025, he's got in motion and in some capacity. Uh, yeah, he's, I mean, he doesn't get back to me for days on end when he [00:31:00] says he would. I mean, I don't think he's committed to one. Timeline where he is like, yeah, I'll get back to you by the point in the entire duration that we've talked.

Athena: Mm-hmm.

Justin: Um, so again, it just distracted broker. I don't know what he's communicating with the seller. Seller's probably fielding these offers or getting additional offers along this, this entire path. And of which I am one of many. Um, so it, again, it, I get it. Uh, you know, I just. I don't mind the negotiate, the, the long form negotiation is fine. That part is not what I have an issue with. It's what is the next, it doesn't have to be accept my LOI or done. It's more of what is the next step come the deadline. Meaning like if it's we're, we're negotiating more points, great. That's, that's fine. 'cause that to me counts as momentum. That's still movement. I think with this one it was like quiet. And again, if it's meant to be great, I'm okay with that, but I'm not, I'm not gonna chase [00:32:00] it 'cause I just, I don't have the bandwidth to do that. Like, that's not where my, my time is best spent right now. Yeah. If it's, you know, if, especially given that, you know, there's, I knew that this was a competitive one and. I'll try to put my best foot forward. I will negotiate as, as best as possible. Um, I will communicate and I have communicated with them via text, email calls, you name it. It is just like been pulling teeth to get responses and now I understand why, you know, be prioritized and, and a lot of other offers. So, um, yeah, I think I just need to be more, uh, intentional at this point. And I think I've learned enough now to to know when something is. Right up the gate has legs or not for me anyway, in my buy box and kind of that kind of criteria. I've got a much better sense of that now, um, than I did when I first started talking to that broker. 'cause it's been five months. So, uh, I think I'm gonna start implementing some of those [00:33:00] protocols and just kind of, you know, I don't know. I only want to, I, I wanna let higher quality through the door kind of from the first moment because I think that's just gonna save time for everybody.

Athena: Yeah, you learn a lot on this deal, you know? Mm-hmm. Like being able to look at performance structures, larger deals, and you'd initially considered, you know, investors private debt. Um, so I think there's a, like I always hear this when you go this deep on a deal and then the next one comes as you're able to move so much more quicker and confidently because you've gone through all that. Yeah. So, um, you know. It was a hell of a learning experience and schooling experience for you too.

Justin: It is, yeah. It was education, you know, and like I said, now I know, I know what to look for. I know red flags, I can identify them very quickly. Now when I'm reading SIMs and having that initial broker conversation, it gets to that point. Like I just, I'm, I'm expediting all of the processes now because I've, I've done it enough [00:34:00] and um, so, you know, that'll be, hopefully that'll be valuable when. Identifying other opportunities and seeing, you know, the green flags. I'm like, okay, this is something that has potential.

Athena: Yeah. Um, do me a favor, if you can, uh, start thinking of that list of criteria and then you and me and Luke tomorrow can start to extract some of that so that Yeah. We're, we're thinking as you and we're reviewing deals also, and, and knowing what some of those, like not getting through the gate kind of. Qualities are so that we're not having the team spend time on things that you're like, no. Um, and we'll talk through the, the other one too, and pluses and minuses, uh, on that one. And I, it's not the first time I've seen that one. Actually. It was interesting that it came back to market. So really interesting. Yeah. Interesting. So you can talk through that in detail tomorrow. Yeah. For you and for everybody else. This is one of the, the awesome parts about getting our analyst team on the calls with you is that we're, you know, we wanna kind of extract that thought process [00:35:00] and have that kind of more collaborative feedback, looking at the deals, that sort of thing so that, um, they can get even better at looking as at deals as you. Um, especially as you all, you know, you, you all have a lot of deal experience, right? We wanna make sure we're iterating on that in our review process upfront. So, um, yeah. Excited to hear, hear some of the criteria and thought processes there, Justin. Yeah. Um, it, it sucks though. It, it sucks so bad when you spend so much time on it and you're like, this feels like a, obviously I, I've been there myself, and it just like, feels like such a good fit and good rapport and you get the deal together and you get another, you know, it went away and it came back and then it's just like, oh God. Like, well, come on.

Justin: Yeah. It, it's more, it's the time for me. You know, I just, that's, that is a commodity. I don't have a lot of. So it's just that one's a, the tough, toughest pill to swallow is like the time that's been allocated. The opportunity cost [00:36:00] that wasn't allocated somewhere else.

Athena: Yeah, but like the, the, the way you will be ex be able to expedite. Your process in the future as a result of this? Like, I know it's so frustrating now, but like, don't how much you learned on this one. Like no.

Justin: Agreed. Yeah. I mean, I, I, I looked at it some recently and I threw it at the calculator. I mean, the entire process took me 15, 20 minutes and I knew. Up, down left. Right? What? Like, and that would've taken me hours and hours to agonize over. And yeah, I don't have to go through that kind of process to that detail to know what should pass most on the first, first step. So yeah, it was a good, it's a good education.

Athena: Yeah. Um, well, um, you know, keep going like. This is, this is part of the process. It's, yep. It's just like, okay, we gotta ha, okay, let's go. Yeah. But honestly, [00:37:00] like, when, when, when the next one and the right one comes, like, you'll see how much benefit this process. Even, even this, like, not, it, not coming through, this is the woo woo Athena. Like, everything happens for a reason. So, you know, the, the, the, the fact that he kept there was this, this like. Attachment to the numbers. Right. And like, well, if we get a higher performance or get like, it doesn't seem like he's that bought into selling. He wants out, but he also wants like a higher number and then like, you know, it's just like counting every dollar and the SDE and stuff like that. So that to me is like hesitant seller because he had the higher offer, he had the higher number, they had terms he didn't like. So I think there's also probably indecision and his, his, his want to sell if he keeps doing this, you know, it's like finding another reason not to sell.

Justin: Yeah, it, it's, [00:38:00] I was thinking through that. I think, uh, I agree that and the, because he, the first round of offers he got where there was a lot of PE on the table and that kind of thing, were based off of numbers that were, 'cause this was closer to the end of 24. They were based off 24, which were, was stronger performance. And so, uh, he saw those zeros and he is like, that's what my business is worth. And then his trailing 12, he's at a dip in H1. And you know, you've gotta weight that, obviously as I did. And, uh, he wasn't getting the same offers, you know, he passed on the PE because of those terms. He didn't like the terms, but he liked the number, he liked the offer size. So he, what he is trying to do is get both. He wants the offer size with the more, most favorable terms. And I think he was just biting time until he could get that and kind of. Keeping me on a burner just in case, or have something to measure against. Um, that, I mean, uh, [00:39:00] you know, again, I don't even, it's annoying, but I, I understand because it's, you know, you're, he's trying to get the highest dollar, he is trying to get the most out of the sale, and it's kind like, yeah, I don't think he would sell if he didn't. Again, it's not a distressed situation, so he's not going to sell unless he was getting that or hopefully getting that. Um, and I think what he got from these other. This other offer, which fairly is very close to mine, the broker says very similar, but they've got their roofer roofing managers. And so he is like, he just feels confident that they're not gonna act a lot of him. They're gonna know what they're doing, they're gonna hit the ground running, and he'll be able to escape even faster. Um.

Athena: Okay. So he is getting his price and his terms supposedly. Yeah. Because he's not gonna have to hold their hand through the process.

Justin: Yep, yep. That's, that's my read on it anyway. Um, broker, you know, he hasn't, he hasn't told me as much, but I, I'm pretty sure that's the situation, given what I know now. Sucks. Yeah. Like I said, it, it is what it is, you know, seller's trying to, [00:40:00] you know, make the most of what he's got. I get it. It's annoying that I was, you know, a part of it, but. Moving on. Let's, um, see, see what else we can do.

Athena: Yeah. Well, luckily the summer vacations are over, so the market's picking back up again. Nice July. Everybody just goes away. Um, and it's really hard to get deal flow going. So, um, cool. Well, um, so heads up for Thursday. Um, I was teaching each of you like forgivable performance based notes individually. So, um, for next Thursday's Buyers Club, we're gonna be pulling up the, um, modeling spreadsheet. Luke's gonna be picking out a good P&L and a bad P&L. I won't have any view of it before the call, so then that way I can kind of talk through, live with you all like just. Brand new. Looking at a P&L, how do I import it into the [00:41:00] modeling template? How do I think of. The structuring and that sort of thing. So, um, I know you've seen me do some of this stuff before, but I just feel like it's good to revisit it again with a particular call out and pull out on performance based forgivable notes and kind of how I structure those, how I look at those. Um, so that's what we're gonna be doing on Thursday. Uh, and then we have, I think I've told you guys this, but we have a tax strategy expert, that's gonna be on the 21st of August. Um, hoping to get a business valuation expert next Thursday, but I'm not sure. Waiting for him to be able to confirm. Um, so I'll let you know what's going on next Thursday, but it should be fun little session on Thursday. You guys can see how I react to a P&L I've never seen before, good and bad. Um, so like Polly and Steve have seen me hysterically laugh when I've looked at financials before. So maybe we'll laugh one of the situations.

Polly: I remember [00:42:00] that. Well, I was just gonna say that that is like, uh. Uh, that's like an answer to prayer is right there when you do that because it, it just gets it in my brain so much more. So, I mean, we all are, we all have our, our strengths and our gifts and, um, that financial model I've gotten to where I really can, I, I can whiz through certain parts of it, obviously, but then I actually, it's almost like, um. I don't think it's a fear, it's an apprehension. Like, what, what am I, I have this idea that maybe this might work, but I'm almost afraid to plug 'em in because I don't know, don't know if it is really gonna work. And I, I think it's just an apprehension. It's not really a fear. So anyway, I'm glad you're doing that. 'cause the more I see that, then I can, I can, you know, we, we both can be a little more. Open to some creative [00:43:00] ways of thinking and so forth. So,

Athena: yeah. Cool. Well, I'll try to pull out like different ideas. 'cause I think it's like if you know the ingredients and you can kind of like, like with cooking, right? Like it just experiment with different flavors and stuff. And if you break it, you just make a new copy and start over again. Yeah. You know? So, um, but like, uh. I was just like, I, I feel like I'm doing this all individually, you know, teaching these things and, okay, so clearly this is an opportunity for us to like, go back into the modeling. I don't think you can have enough of it. Um, and then having a little fun with Luke, picking out some P&Ls that are either gonna make me laugh or. You know, smack my head or whatever, but like you guys have to do that. Every time we put a deal in front of you is like grab those P&Ls so you can see, you know, from no knowledge whatsoever putting it in. How I start looking at it, how I analyze it. So hopefully that'll be helpful on Thursday. We'll have a, a couple new, um, [00:44:00] clients joining as well. Um, and yeah, and I have calls with all of you tomorrow and the team, so we'll see you tomorrow. We can dive a little bit deeper. Um, you know, just like we asked Justin to do, if you guys have that. You know, as you're refining your criteria, you're thinking like, through those things in your own process. Like, let's talk through that too with, um, the team so that they can be looking at deals as you. Um, I do, you know, communicate a lot of that, but just wanna make sure if, if, if and when that stuff comes up and you're changing parts of your own process or analysis, then we can have that feedback loop on those weekly calls too, with the team so that they're taking that into account. Awesome. Well, sounds good. Keep us posted. Um, see you all tomorrow and giving you 10 minutes back in your day unless there's anything else you wanted to chat about, have questions about feeling good. All right. Cool. Um, see you all tomorrow. [00:45:00] Thanks. Appreciate it. Bye care. Bye.
