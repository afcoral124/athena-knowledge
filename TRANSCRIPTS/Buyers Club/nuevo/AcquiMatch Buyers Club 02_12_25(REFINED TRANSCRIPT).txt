AcquiMatch Buyers Club — 02/12/2025

[00:01:15]
Athena: I know you interact with Ryan too, but it's just really good to hear the various stages of where people are at and what's going on in your deals. So first I want to pick on something we should be celebrating. Joe, do you want to fill us in on your news?

Joe: Yeah. Uh, thanks, Athena. I got under LOI, uh, Monday night or Tuesday morning, something like that. So. Good feeling.

Athena: That's amazing. And last buyers club, we were, we were not feeling, we weren't sure, like, come on, how's the negotiation? So what happened from Thursday to signed LOI? Fill us in. What did you do?

Joe: Um, Athena and team, one thing you guys probably don't know about me, I think I'm a little bit impulsive and brash. I'm working on it. I have—

Athena: no idea, Joe.

Joe: Yeah. Um, you know, Ryan talked me off the ledge a little. Um, I had a— well, after our call last week, I requested an in-person [00:02:00] with the seller one more time. And I just told them, hey, look, I'm a, I'm a traditionalist and I like in-person meetings, you know, came up with some excuse for him to see me one more time because you can always better gauge someone, maybe soften them up a little bit more in person. So he paid for lunch. We went over some of the items. Um, it was more still favoring him as you, as you know, but through the process of last week, I was realizing, Hey, it's a good deal. Um, uh, the competition out there, he knows what he has long term success in the business. And I'm sitting there thinking, yeah, I need to swallow some pride and let's just, let's get this going and worry, you know, if something comes back in the way of the due diligence, not worry about it. That's that's for at that time. So it can't be perfect at the beginning. And, um, we'll see. So it's perfect so far, though, in the way of at least getting under letter,

Athena: so exciting. Okay. So, [00:03:00] um, just like to fill in some of the, the, you know, coloring lines on this coloring book of Joe's deal. Um, Um, what's also really special about this is it's in your hometown, right? It's where you grew up. So Justin and I were just at an event last Thursday, and we were hearing, you know, about how sometimes that can be hard when you're working with trades and like, you're new to a town or whatever, like the fact that you have that story of like, you're going to be taking over and, and, you know, if you're thinking through the transition story to everybody in the community about like, you actually grew up there, you knew, you know, that like, what an amazing handover, And a way for you to like, kind of hopefully create affinity with the team and customers and stuff like that. You're not some random outside investor that's coming in to buy it up and just like roll it up into a bunch of different businesses, you know,

Joe: that's true. And I think, uh, I haven't given that enough thought. [00:04:00] And when I do think of it every so often, and thanks for reminding me. It's, I know a lot of people in that town, which is good for marketing. Even a lot of my current customers and what I'm doing with my current W2, no, we have just kind of medical facilities. I know them. Uh, so it's a pretty cool, uh, network that's already existing. To just,

Athena: I like, this is just like me being like weird like I am, but I always feel like branding and marketing opportunities and also connecting to your like person. Like, I feel like you need to start the cool wizards whiskey club. Like,

Joe: the cool is a clear ice cube society, like,

Athena: have your whiskey meetings. So, um, That, you know, it goes a long way, though, especially with these, like, small family and businesses, you can even get the local paper to write about, you know, what a cool story that is that you're keeping small businesses in the hands of, like, a small owner and that sort of thing. And it's stuff we can start talking to you about as you go through this process, like, thinking through. The [00:05:00] transition, so it's something for all of you to think about, like, as you go through the process, like, we're, we're here to help you get the deal closed, but also to think through, like, what does the transition look like when you, when you are going to be doing the transition? And how do you want to manage that? Um, so I think it's amazing. And also, um, Justin, uh, was at the event here in Austin, and it was like me and 2 other deal sourcing experts or people that do deal sourcing. And there's a guy that does like, you know, he only does off market, um, and he does like deals north of 500 K or whatever. And he's like, I'll pretty much do any industry, but I won't do HVAC because it's too competitive. So, so I was like, and I was sitting there thinking about you. It was like, Joe, like, and we just had the buyers club meeting where you're like, I don't know. And I was like, I can't tell you how good of a deal this is. You know, so for there was a reason why that industry is so exciting for folks, you know, so I'm really excited to hear that. So what are your [00:06:00] thoughts in terms of next steps? Where are you going from here?

Joe: Yeah, I think some emails just hit my inbox from Ryan. Um, we need to get the, the lending process going, obviously start getting kind of a term sheet. So there's plenty of financials. I don't have yet from the seller. Really? We've only been working off of 3 P&Ls. But just like we talked about a few calls ago, Hey, look, you know, get it under, get under letter, get under exclusivity, um, worry about the accuracy of things down the road and, uh, you know, along with the tax returns balance sheets and everything like that, uh, and following that process, it, it keeps it less stuffy. I think with the seller, especially in the fact that he's, he's off market, small business. Now, I've been meeting with him in person and so, yes, less threatening, I guess. Right. And it shows that you trust what he's showing you, um, even though it's a little bit different, you know, from a beginning to where we are [00:07:00] now. Right. And, uh, yeah, so I am trying to get with the different lenders that Ryan is sending my way that we can find out the comprehensive list of all the financials they need. I'd like to be able to get that list off to the seller by tomorrow with maybe a request. You know, hopefully we can get the financials back to him by Friday, Monday. I already have regular Monday calls that Ryan and I are going to move to, and then I'll be setting up weekly calls with the seller. So kind of all that checklist stuff that's on the. Um,

Athena: yeah. Awesome. Some things I think about that due diligence spreadsheet, even if it's going to overwhelm the seller, it can really help you keep track of everything. Because when you start speaking to lenders, QoE, lawyers, insurance, they're all going to make requests for documents, and oftentimes they're the same things. So I like sending lenders— You can't necessarily send that document to lenders; your priority is, like, what are the documents the lender needs? [00:08:00] You know, marking that as high priority in that due diligence spreadsheet. And then for everybody else, your QoE, your lawyers, your insurance due diligence, you can send them that spreadsheet and be like, can you check the box on all the documents that you need as part of your diligence process. So it makes it really easy for them because they can just check the boxes and then it makes it easier for you because you're not getting emailed lists. And I don't know why, but there's like, 5,000,000 different names for profit and loss statements. Like, okay, and I made this document because we were like, you know, supporting on due diligence at one point. And I was just like, come on. So it makes it really easy and easier for them. The, the problem with the Google sheet is like lenders, firewalls and compliance. You can't use it for that. So oftentimes they will send you their own list. I would also say that the thing. With your seller, and this is anybody that's moving into an offer right now and through to [00:09:00] October, because we can now file taxes until October, uh, is that you need to get them working on getting their 24 taxes complete.

Ryan: Yeah,

Athena: so that's the thing that I would tell him to focus on, like, right now. It's like, hey, get me your tax returns for previous years. And also. Um, the thing that will hold this up is you getting your 24 taxes done. So we need you to get that done as soon as possible. So, like, writing them on that. I've seen other deals just get delayed, delayed, delayed, delayed because the seller was, like, delaying on them, especially off market. So, in terms of priority of all things, like, those 24 tax returns are probably going to be the thing that the bank needs in order to get you a term sheet.

Joe: Yeah.

Athena: Yeah. So I just get the seller, you know, focused on that and then prioritizing their, their documents. So the first thing we need is term sheets. So whatever you need to get lending, you know, into a good place and get a term sheet, then the next thing will be the QoE. So any additional documents there. So sellers can get overwhelmed when you give them the huge [00:10:00] list of stuff all at once. Um, also there's weekly meetings that you're setting with the seller. I would recommend, like, maybe every other one to have it be in person. If you can. And and I've heard of people having exceptional results when they make the weekly meeting, like, an in-person thing, but I know that might not be possible, but, like, every other one, to do an in-person meeting, it just helps build the rapport, the trust, et cetera. So when those findings come back and those deal adjustments come back that you're going to have to do, you've got a good relationship with him. He trusts you. You know, you're making the effort of going there. So it's clear that you want to get a deal done. Um, but that little point of actually going to them, especially when there's like, like, you just did with the, it's like, we still have some final terms. We need to negotiate. Doing it over email is probably the worst and where I always see things fall apart. Like, don't negotiate over email. [00:11:00] If possible get them on the phone or even better in person. Um, but yeah, it sounds like you're in a good place. How are you feeling?

Joe: Oh, good about it. Yeah. Good. Thank you. Yeah,

Athena: but like take a moment to celebrate. That's a big win.

Joe: Yeah. Thank you. I did over the weekend. Oh, I maybe I celebrate a little early.

Athena: Good. Good. It's amazing. So, um, yeah, we'll keep a tapping on you to hear how it's going. Um, you know, I always joke with all of you when you sign on a while, like, now the hard part starts, um, you know, and shopping to lenders and that sort of thing. But it's also. You're under exclusivity, and you've both made a commitment that this is what you want, so it takes some of the pressure off there. Now it's the pressure of okay, I've got to work with all these people and manage that seller. Seller can get pretty frustrated by the due diligence process because it, as much as you can try to prepare them [00:12:00] for what's to come, if you haven't had that talk already, Joe, that might be something worth doing since it's off market because they don't have a broker telling them what's going on.

Joe: And he actually— He has a history of, he went through SBA to buy a business in the late 90s, obviously different times, different terms and everything, but he also, he sold that same business. So he's at least familiar a little bit with the process.

Athena: Great. And another thing I'll say to you, which I'm sure Ryan's already told you, but for the benefit of everybody here, because you can't hear it enough, if you're working. Any, any deal actually on or off market. If the seller doesn't get have a lawyer, then tell them that, hey, we know people that do this all day long that work with sellers. It would obviously be different than me. So there would be no conflict of interest, but we've seen the lawyers on the sell side [00:13:00] mess up deals and actually, you know, we're working on a deal right now, or it's blowing up at the 11th hour because the lawyer on the sell side, um, doesn't necessarily understand these transactions and is adding in a bunch of terms and, and like, you know, seller doesn't know whether the terms actually should be there or not. So it's, it's hard for them. So it makes your lives easier if they have advisors that understand how these transactions go. Um, so I'd try to get that in earlier than later if, if he doesn't already have someone, do you know what he's doing for a lawyer?

Joe: I do. I brought it up in our— I think our first face to face and he has a business lawyer, not necessarily M and A. So I've already, I've planted the seed. I haven't moved him probably off the position. I was talking with Ryan about it this afternoon. Um, it bears me bringing it up again to him. And maybe we just, we,

Athena: what you might want to say is like, Hey, I know you love [00:14:00] your business lawyer, but we've seen a lot of people like lose these opportunities to sell by not working with somebody that does these SBA small business M&A transactions. It wouldn't hurt you to have a conversation, like, maybe have a conversation with somebody. You don't have to, like, make a commitment or whatever, but, like, remove, you know, from, like, the sales aspect, like, remove the pressure of having to, like, make a commitment. And once they talk to somebody and be like, oh, my gosh, like, and then. You know, queue up the lawyers to be like, okay, well, if you're going to work with your guy, go back and ask them this, this, this, this, this, and this. Like, do you— have you done these kinds of transactions before? Have you been involved with SBA? I mean, you know, how many transactions did you do last year? You know, um, so I either— you team up with some questions to go back and ask his lawyer. And we have that questions for lawyers document in the, um, on your [00:15:00] dashboard that you could pull some from there for him to ask. To be helpful and or say like, Hey, there's no pressure to hire somebody, but maybe it might be worth talking to somebody that just does these types of transactions to see how they compare to your guy that you already know.

Joe: Yep. Heck just, yeah, just Google it and find someone local. If you need someone local doesn't have to be from our suggestion, just make sure you have the right background and credentials in the lawyers himself. Yeah.

Athena: I mean, hey, if, if, is he comfortable? You guys are meeting on Zoom or a phone call?

Joe: Who's that? The seller?

Athena: Oh, actually, do you know what? Um, Ryan, we know Tampa based attorneys that we could potentially— because you already have your person, right? Joe.

Joe: Yeah, yeah, planning go go with him. I mean, he does SBA and small. So.

Athena: Yeah, so we know we actually know some, uh, [00:16:00] Tampa based attorneys that we could get you that that also do sell side. I'm almost positive they do sell side also. So if you want someone in the area, then maybe that could be very curious to the group. Yeah, it's the SMB Law Group. So they're kind of one of the most like, it's Sam Rosati and like his law firm, but a couple of them are based in— yeah, they're, they're probably one of the more, just like Barlow Williams, one of the more reputable ones, like they did Acquiring Minds episodes and that sort of thing. Um, we just need to check if they do— I'm almost positive they also do sell side, but they're in Tampa. So we can check on that. Nice work. Anything else we can help you with at this point? Or you want to chat with her? Okay.

Joe: Uh, I don't know if it's for this conversation, but you know that Ryan and I are also working on a backup late breaking opportunity to where one got [00:17:00] relisted. The one that was really interested in last year. So might as well keep things running in parallel and make sure something's going to happen. Right?

Athena: It's not, it's not only that, but also your mindset is different when you know you have options, so, you know, when we were sending, like, when you're already under offer on something, when you're looking at other opportunities, it helps you gut check the one that you have.

Ryan: You—

Athena: know, and just be like, is the grass really greener? Like, how do I, how do I still feel about the one I have under offer? And you negotiate from a different place, right? Like, so if you think about it, like the dating, if you're dating several people, then you're not getting like super. Um, as opposed to if you're, you've got the scarcity mindset and you're like, this is the only deal I'm ever going to see, you know, [00:18:00] and then you might make allowances or negotiate on the—

Joe: desperation at the end, right? Desperation. So, yeah, um, first call with the, uh, the selling broker today, but again, I've already talked with him a couple of times. Yeah. And the company's on the up, numbers look good, they're gauging it more towards SBA, which is great as well. Their debt service looks great, and they didn't even put a lot of add backs in, so, Um, it's just a different field, different industry altogether, so the multiple's quite a bit lower, which is good. And, you know, like I say, um, every, each one of us with pluses and minuses and allow me to, as you say, uh, kind of gut check things and negotiate possibly, uh, from a different position between the two. So, hopefully I'll make fast progress the next week on that.

Athena: Awesome. Nice work. That's great. Joe. Thanks. Cool. Um, I just saw Jason in the chat. Jason, are you around? Do you want to chat? I might, might pick on you. I see where you're at in your deal. [00:19:00]

Jason: You're not picking on me. It's okay.

Athena: Congrats for Jason though. I don't know if we like officially announced it to everybody, but Jason, what was your news?

Jason: Uh, well, this is my news that I'm under LOI. Is that my news?

Athena: Yeah.

Jason: Uh, I am under LOI and kind of what Athena says, like, this is just the beginning.

Athena: Yeah. Especially with yours. You've got some interesting—

Jason: challenges—

Athena: on yours. So,

Jason: uh, listen, I, you know, I started seeing myself in this business. I was like, oh, I was like getting ahead. I was like, uh, you know, been listening to Acquiring Minds. I've been building these new websites, how we can grow the business. And then, uh, I talked to the seller last week in person and his accounting software is 20 years old. Uh, the person I do, I'm doing quality of earnings. He's like, I was five years old when the software was made, so I'm like, okay, it's running Windows 2000. [00:20:00] If you're that old to remember, Windows 2000.

Athena: I am. I use it. A lot. Uh, it's— Windows 98 was the other one. What was the one before that? Yeah, he's got one of—

Jason: these dot matrix printers, if y'all remember these, with the little holes on the side and you gotta line it up properly, like, this is what I'm dealing with. So, uh, and on the other challenge, he does it, reconcile his books on a monthly basis. He just does it when he needs to do his taxes. So, uh, we're at a point that we're in a little bit of a standstill. There's gonna be some education here. Uh, I did get his 2024 balance sheet, uh, but obviously that is not enough for an underwriter. Uh, so I'm going to have to, and I've been working, uh, with some lenders to kind of get the requirements and say like, Hey seller, like the underwriter is going to want these things. And I thought [00:21:00] you would have enough to get us to underwriting, but you don't. And you're going to have to modernize your accounting system, because essentially you're doing bad accounting and it's not going to be good enough for the amount of money that you're wanting. So, this is not a cost I can occur because you own the business, like, you're going to have to incur this cost. Literally, he's got file cabinets of invoices for over 20 years. We're talking rooms of invoices. And, you know, I'm just going to tell them, like, you don't have to go that far back, but you got to go, like, a couple of years back and reconcile your books on a monthly basis. And, oh, by the way, every time we go into a new month, you're going to have to reconcile that month too.

Athena: So what's your, what's your thoughts on, I don't know if you and Ryan could, Ryan and I chatted about this too, and have you and Ryan comment on like the solutions that you're going to present to the seller in this. So to fill everybody in, this is another off market [00:22:00] deal. So when the broker comes across a business like this, the broker is the one that like, okay, gets them to do all this stuff. So unfortunately without a broker involved, you now get to become the educator and the facilitator of, of how helping them get to where you need them to be, to be able to sell. So what solutions are, are you thinking of or how are you thinking of, of working with a seller through this process?

Jason: Yeah, so we meet every, uh, Thursday afternoon, so he's big on pen and paper and printing things out. Um, you know, I, I think I talked about this. When he sends me stuff, he'll print it out, write his notes, scan it into the computer, and send it back to me, so I've, I've, I'm kind of meeting him where he is, where he's at, so I write things up on paper, I print them out, I bring it to his desk, we talk through it, so this is kind of my approach, and to say like, hey, I've got, you know, I was just working on the doc, it's like, there are like six or seven things [00:23:00] that the underwriter is going to want from an SBA loan perspective that you're going to need. So, you know, I'm going to try to help him come to the conclusion to say, like, how do you think we can accomplish this goal?

Athena: Yeah, so, um, I had some thoughts on how you can solve. I mean,

Jason: please, because I feel like this is slowly slipping away. Like, is he going to do this? I feel like he's still pretty motivated, like, uh, over the weekend. He was trying to get, like, all these, you know, bank statements for the past three years and the bank only provides statements up to 18 months and you know, it's not good enough. So.

Athena: Well, I mean, I think you're able to go into the banks and get them to, like, print off statements at the very least, but in terms of his books, you know, so what's been good is that he has been doing accounting. [00:24:00] He's just using it on a system that, like, is not exportable. Nobody else can use. Nobody else is comfortable with. Um, like,

Jason: yeah, there's no way like, uh, working with my accountant,

Athena: but the thing is, is that like, he's done, he's been doing his books. He's been filing his tax return. So, yes, most people like, you know, lenders or whatever, aren't going to touch it in the state that it's in. It doesn't mean that it's not something that can be solved. So one of the things that I love doing in this instance is like, well, okay, what's the ideals? And like, what are the lenders— actually, they need probably like QuickBooks, you know, access to be able to manipulate things. They need P&Ls. They need balance sheets, you know, AR, AP reports.

Jason: Yeah. I think the biggest—

Athena: thing is for the last year and then the P&Ls and everything else for the last three years. So it's not that the information doesn't exist to be able to verify this stuff. It's that it's not in a system that [00:25:00] anybody uses. So if I were you, then I would, you know, as you're saying like, Hey, you told me, like, you know, to go get financing. Well, here's the things that they're going to need. Unfortunately, you know, with your current system, we're not able to get that over to him. So I want to help you. Um, if you leave it to him to figure out how to modernize, he's not going to do it in a way that works. Right? So what I would recommend is that you get him to foot the bill, but you project manage it, right? So you help find somebody locally that can go and sit on that man's computer and in that man's desk that is a bookkeeper that can take everything and put it in. And I'm sure this happens all the time, right? Like there will be local people that have experience of taking someone's paper and their— you know, and he's got all those little invoices that he puts on a stick and that sort of thing. And, um, and, uh, you know, that old accounting system, they'll [00:26:00] probably just have to sit there with his computer and plug it all in to QuickBooks and then scan all the things and like verify it. So I would be looking for somebody that has experienced doing that, that will get you what you need in the outcome. And then I would be offering a project manager, but he needs to foot the bill and or, you know, maybe you guys agree to split the cost at close and you add it to the purchase price or something like that. Right? So, like, where you're not out if, if, you know, you do this initial thing. Reminding him that like, hey, this isn't just me. You will literally not be able to sell this business to anyone without going through this process. So, um, I want to help. I also want to get you somebody, you know, I will help identify someone. I'll even help like brief them so that because he doesn't know what the current systems are clearly because he's using the old ones. So [00:27:00] when I brief someone or when I ask someone to do something, you know, I tell the team this a lot, right? It's like, well, I can come up with the solution, but you're the ones that are going to be using it. So you probably want to come up with a solution and figure out what's best for you. Okay. Rather than me telling you, I think is you're probably not going to like what I come up with. So it's the same thing with him. If you go to him and you're like, well, you need to modernize your books and he'll be like, okay, I'll get it on— I don't know, whatever, you know, like QuickBooks, it's not QuickBooks online, and then you're still in the same state and whatever. So it's like, um, get him to realize he has a problem, get him to realize that he's not going to be able to sell his business to anyone, and get him to realize he's working with probably the best buyer that's very patient, that is not seeing this as a walkaway, and you'll help him through the process. Like, hey, I'll help find someone. I'll even help brief them so that, [00:28:00] you know, we get it to the place that the lenders are going to be happy and then everybody else is going to be happy. So, so we can do this transaction because I like you. I'm seeing myself in your business, but unfortunately, I can't, you know, even get past the lenders at this state with where you're at.

Jason: Yeah, that's kind of my approach. I was going to say— like, you're going to need to do this to sell it to anybody that requires a loan, you know, I want to say, like, give it to your kids. They don't seem to want it or, like. Anybody else comes up behind me wanting to buy and use SBA, like, they're gonna have to go through the same process. Strategic—

Athena: buyer, like, nobody will touch it. Like, yeah, you know, it's, it's not bad books, but it's in the same pocket as because most people won't have the patience like you would to go and, you know, help and find somebody to do all this. So, you know, where. [00:29:00] If you really love it and you see yourself in it, then it might be worth helping this guy out. And I mean, I like the—

Jason: guy. So I'm, I'm, I'm willing to help him out. Um, you know, I, I don't see him walking away, but I definitely want to show him the list where it's like, you know, I just worked on the list. Like, Hey, you got all the corporate tax returns for the last three years. You got that, you know, 2024 year-end financial statement. You got that. You don't, you know, this is where the things that you don't have the. Profit and loss statement for January for 2025, right? It's to me. It's not even 2025 because it's financial year into October. So it's like, they're going to want November, December, January. They're going to want all 3 of those months, right? Uh, you know, the debt schedule, which he really has no debt. So I think that one's, you know, I could kind of check that one off. Uh, where he kind of has that and then the other one was like a year to date accounts payable receivable receivable aging reports. I [00:30:00] don't think he has that. That's that's another one where I think he needs it.

Athena: That's going to be essential though. Because that's your— so actually like review. We have Chris coming on Thursday to talk work in progress and working capital, which is what those accounts payable accounts receivable help you determine. You know, because he took money up front for things that are still in process. So, without accounting for that, there's no way of you knowing, like, well, how do we split up the money that you collected for something I'm still going to have to deliver on. So, you know, exactly— you have, like, a basic. I like using, um, like 10th grade language, even for people that are super smart.

Jason: Uh, no, listen, if you're not able to explain something in simple terms, I believe you don't know what you're talking about.

Athena: Right, so each one of those documents, not only can you explain it in simple terms, but explain why it's needed, right? So be like, hey, you're going to have taken money up front for projects that are still going to be in process. [00:31:00] And we're going to have to figure out how to divvy that up between us. Right. And like, okay, that's, that's reasonable. So, you know, he might be like, no, I don't want to do that. Or he might be really grateful and probably maybe part of him has known that he's needed to modernize this for a really long time, but didn't know where to get started. So it's like, Hey, if I found someone local, you know, would you be willing to go through this process? So we could try to get this, this, you know, because nobody, nobody will buy your business with books like this.

Jason: No, I think he joked with me too. He, and he was, you know, he said, no, my kids came in here and they're like, that's the same computer when, from when I was eight years old. Right. And they're like,

Athena: how is the computer not broken up to this point? Like it's not on the internet.

Jason: I mean, it's not on the internet, right. It would have been hacked almost immediately. But how is it—

Athena: still working? Like, Oh, he was prideful. He—

Jason: walked over and he's like, you see this computer, he's like, it's been running 20 years. [00:32:00] No problem.

Athena: Oh my God. I mean, I, I, I saw something similar. You know, when I went and looked at the, um, event equipment rental business that I was looking to buy down in Harlingen and they're there, they were also running and this was like, 17 million dollars worth of inventory. They were running on this, like. And it was the dot matrix printer and it was this inventory software that had stopped— no more updates were done, like, 10 years ago, you know, so they were still running 5 different locations, 17 million dollars of inventory on this, like, old process. That I wouldn't have been able to export anything and I was just like, Oh my God, you know, for for the size of business that you're looking at, that's a manageable, like to do three years, it's a scary, it's a lot of work, but you can hire someone locally to do that for 17 million dollars and five locations [00:33:00] of stuff like that would have been, I mean, a year to be able to get that. Yeah, I,

Jason: I was also thinking about the computer so old. I kind of want to go over there. You know, I have a computer background. I was like, let me image this thing for you. Just like if this hard drive dies, you're screwed.

Athena: You can offer that to him. So you're showing like, Hey, I want to help, you know, and like, nobody else is going to offer you to do this. They're probably going to offer you a lot less money, right? To buy your business without like, so I think you know what to do. Um, how do you feel about helping project manage the modernization?

Jason: I mean, I feel like I've been doing it already. So,

Athena: yeah, so I bet you could find someone local that like could do the work rather than you. You don't want to do that. Like, just get somebody that knows how to take paper and put it into QuickBooks.

Jason: And yeah, I was thinking about my bookkeeper I already have for my real estate. I'm like, I'll ask her, like, have you done this before?

Athena: Great. Yeah. Wendy and I were talking. She's like, oh my God, I was trained [00:34:00] on that software.

Jason: I don't understand it. I sat there for an hour. It just made no sense to me.

Athena: Yeah. So you probably want someone that understood— that that was trained on that software that understood, you know, or had some experience with it. Um, but we, we did this for our business. We switched from one software to another. So this is a normal thing for bookkeepers to do, um, you know, to be able to find support to do that. Unfortunately, we, we found someone online to do it because we did one online to another, but I, there's so many bookkeepers, I imagine someone locally will have worked with people to bring their books into QuickBooks online.

Jason: Yeah, I'm gonna offer the, uh, just the image, the machine. So it was just like, okay, let's get a digital image of this. Even if your computer dies. Like, I can put this somewhere. So, like, if a computer dies, you always have, like, some [00:35:00] type of backup that will save you.

Athena: Yeah, good. Cool. Um, so how are you feeling? Anything else we can help with or discuss today? Or you know what your next step is? Uh,

Jason: no. I kind of know my next steps on that. And you know, kind of go back to, you know, mom said shop around, like I'm looking at this other business. Because, you know, who knows what might happen. Because, right, he might say I'm out. I'm like, okay, well it's not a big deal. I get it. Exactly.

Athena: Yeah, that's why we like to keep sending you deals even after you're under offer. Like, for all the reasons I just talked about with Joe. Gut check on whether you still love this one. And just helping you. You know, not be desperate or you might end up finding something else that you absolutely love that feels like a better fit. So, you know, and it just gives you when things get crunchy. And if this is your business, you still have that, you're coming from that confidence. Like, well, I got options too. Do you got no other buyers? So what are you going to do?

Jason: Right. And I think he, [00:36:00] he's one of those like, right, he's in his mid seventies. I think he wants out. He realizes, like, if he gets, gives this to his kids, he's not out. He's still in it, right? Because he wants, there's— There's kids, he wants to see his kids successful. Here's a little fact for—

Athena: you too, only 30 percent of businesses survive a generational handover.

Jason: Yeah, you're talking like his kids are interested in other things.

Athena: So, unlikely that they will be part of the 30 percent that make it if they're not interested in it, if you were to give it to them.

Jason: Yeah, that's a good point. So I'm really going to actually probably update my document with him and say, like, this is what— that's like, this is what they need. And then like another column saying, here's the reason why they need it.

Athena: Amazing. Good work. Congrats. I know. Feels like a lot, but you know, that's, that's the kind of flavor of off market deals. You get to do a lot of this stuff with the [00:37:00] broker. I mean, it's fine.

Jason: Yeah, to me, with everything in life that you really want, the obstacle is away. So. 

Athena: Oh, really? 

Jason: Yeah, I read, I've read all his books. I'm reading the right thing right now, actually. Right. Like every night. It's great.

Athena: Great writer. Love it. Awesome. Good work. Jason. Keep us posted. We're obviously always here to troubleshoot and we'll keep picking on you to see how it goes.

Jason: Then shine the spotlight on me whenever you want.

Athena: Awesome. Great. Okay. Cool. Well, um, so Gil, I wanted to chat with you. You've been kind of in the calls, but we haven't had a lot of chance to talk. So I know you're, you're talking on, uh, one or if not two deals, Ryan's a little bit more active with you, but fill us in where you are, how's your deal process going? Um,

Gil: I—

Athena: had—

Gil: two possible deals, uh, that I was reviewing, uh, had broker meetings and seller meetings with in, uh, with the one that was on market. Uh, but the, after the last [00:38:00] seller meeting, um, I decided against it. Um, and at another seller meeting for an off market deal, it was our second one. Uh, it was about 90 minutes long. And after that one, uh, we decided to— I decided to not pursue that any further. So right now I'm in a holding pattern.

Athena: Cool. So talk us through the decision making process, because these were the first couple that you were looking at. So this is part of the calibration and learning process. So what, what, what was the decision making process on both of them?

Gil: Uh, the decision making process or why I said no?

Athena: Yeah, why you said no.

Gil: So the first one was very much construction related and, uh, their books went down from 23 to 24 because of the weather, uh, the weather here, the weather in New York just wasn't cooperating. Uh, so the concrete couldn't, uh, dry out and they didn't buy wood and it was a lumberyard. [00:39:00] Uh, and I didn't want to be dependent on weather. I didn't want to be dependent on, uh, construction lots being available. I didn't want to be— the construction industry just wasn't something that I was comfortable with. So that was one thing. Uh, that was the on market deal. The other, the other deal that was off market, uh, the guy was a very much type A personality kind of person and he controlled everything. Uh, one of the questions I asked him was when's the last time he took some time off and how did the business operate? And he said that he didn't. Uh, he takes long weekends in the summer. And that's about it. Uh, and—

Athena: How old was he?

Gil: I'm sorry?

Athena: How old was he?

Gil: Uh, is Ryan here? I'd say he's in his 60s. Late 50s, early 60s. 65 somewhere. 65? Okay. Um, and, uh, he was looking to retire. Looking to sell the business. Um, but uh [00:40:00] the culture I believe that he built within the company itself of him having his hands and everything all the time was something that I was worried about. I was also worried about the fact that his people are used to him doing that and they don't want more responsibility. And I thought that that would have been uphill battle. Um, so from a cultural perspective and from a perspective of, you know, him having ownership of everything, uh, even from planning routes to scheduling to making sure that the trucks are staffed— are filled. Um, I thought that was the wrong deal for me.

Athena: So, um. One of the things we typically want to look at, like, well, let me ask you this, if, if he wasn't as, as you perceive to be too involved with the business, would the business still have been something of interest to you? Would it have been a good fit for you?

Gil: It would have been a fit. I don't know if it's a good fit. Um, because another thing that I was talking about with Ryan is that I, I could see myself doing it, but I couldn't see myself happy doing it. Um, [00:41:00]

Athena: so with the, especially with the off market opportunities, and when you're early on in the search process, you have such an amazing opportunity to learn and explore and have, like, kind of further along down the convert, like, chat conversations. So, um, with that. You know, one of the things that will come up time and time again with, you know, 65 plus is it is a generational thing that their whole identity is work and you're— you're not— it's very unlikely that you're not going to find somebody that that's like that with that age group, just because that's how they define themselves. So it's not that the owner [00:42:00] needs to do everything. It's that they're choosing to do everything that they're choosing not to go on vacations. And something that happens a lot of times when, um, owners are wanting to retire is they, they kind of have a moment during this process or multiple moments where they pull out and or stall things because they don't know what life looks like. If they're not working, they literally don't have an identity. They don't feel like they have any utility in the world or any use. If they're not working. So, when I hear that, it's not necessarily a red flag for me. That's an opportunity and an invitation to go deeper on what are they actually doing? And is it genuinely that the new owner is the only person that can do those things? Or are they things that could be outsourced to other people, or is the team [00:43:00] sick of being dictated to and would love to step up and take on more ownership and more responsibility. And that is a great opportunity to kind of explore that. So you'll hear Ryan and the team say this a lot and I say it and I'm saying it for the benefit of the group. If we're making assumptions about a business and a culture, but we haven't been able to go in and validate it, then it's an opportunity for us to, like, keep having conversations and, like, maybe even go and do a walkthrough and see what the culture is like, or see if you can do a secret shop in a way, or be brought in as a consultant and do a walkthrough of the business or do a ride along with the owner. So you're getting more insight into them and like how they operate and what the business is like. And you're also able to go further down the track, which is getting you more experience. Um, but we always want to, like, verify our assumptions a little bit deeper, especially on things like that, where often it can be the owner [00:44:00] just wants to work. They don't want to take vacation.

Gil: Yeah, I mean, to a certain degree, that that might be it. Um, but there are other elements there, uh, like most of the, they had, uh, I think four or five employees out of the eight and were there for over 20 years, so I don't think it's a fact that people are sick of him dictating everything. Um, he keeps a space between his office and the front so he can hear what's happening in the front. Uh, so he has control over that all the time. He's very much a control freak to a certain degree. Um, all those things together, I think that that's why I said no to that. Um, I just didn't think that it was ready for somebody to come in and start delegating and giving people more responsibility. Or if they're not ready for that responsibility hiring new people. Um, I think that would have been too scary for them.

Athena: Did you— did you meet them? Did they verify that?

Gil: No. [00:45:00]

Athena: Okay. So it's an assumption that you're making.

Gil: Yeah.

Athena: So I'd invite you to rather than making those assumptions, like walk further down the line to actually verify those assumptions. Um, you know, Kevin, who joined the call last week, um, the business that they went into the owners made everybody on the team work out of the same inbox they did, like, you know, there was a lot of that and when they came in, the two employees were exceptional and they were like, hey, we want to bump you up more responsibility. Is that something you want to do? And they were excited. They were excited to get their own email inboxes. They were excited to have autonomy. And be able to, like, have fresh energy and owners that trusted them. So, you know, while we can make assumptions until we meet those people and see, like, it might be the complete opposite of what you're thinking. But every business that you [00:46:00] take over, you're going to have to do transition. Yeah. You know, you're going to have to do a cultural transition. You're going to have to meet the employees and do an assessment of who's at the level that you're expecting versus what the, you know, previous owner expected— that audit analysis transition process building relationships. Like, you're going to have to do that no matter what business that you take over. So it can be an opportunity to be, you know, especially since it's off market, a lot of times the owners are like, yeah, come by, stop by, you know, and if they don't want their employees to catch wind of, you know, a possible sale and what I usually, you know, say is like, Hey, can we like, say that I'm, I'm a consultant that you're bringing in, you know, and like you have specialized experience and that sort of thing. So you could, if they were to look at your LinkedIn, they'd be like, Oh, yeah, you know, this is a technical consultant coming in to look at our systems or something so that it's not weird that you're asking questions, but then you get an opportunity to, like, a lot [00:47:00] of times we're going to come up with noes. Right? We're going to come up with reasons why it's not going to work. And a lot of that's based on fear rather than reality. So, you know, with this, there's not really much on the line apart from you getting more experience and getting to learn. Are the things that I'm thinking are deal breakers genuinely deal breakers or are those assumptions that I made?

Gil: Okay, noted. Um, yeah.

Athena: Um, you know, if it hasn't been killed already, it might be an opportunity to see if you can go meet with the owner. If not, just keep that in mind on like future conversations, right? Um, especially older owners, and that's for everybody to bear in mind is like, I know none of us want to take on an 80 hour a week job, but a lot of times that's that's what they're doing because they don't they don't see themselves doing anything else. And that's what they want to do. And that's how they fill their time. And that's what gives them life and purpose. Answering the phone, the owner is doing the bookkeeping, the owner, you know, like doing menial tasks that would be very easy to outsource to somebody else and free up a lot of those hours. So we want to kind of work out like, what is what are you actually doing day to day? And is that something that the owner has to do? Or is the owner choosing to do that? And again, with with, um, you know, these retiring owner businesses, they don't really— they don't know about outsourcing or delegation or, you know, using EAs or VAs or, you know, that sort of thing too, so they don't realize that's an option. And sometimes it's a really like easy, quick win to remove a lot of the stuff that the owner is doing that aren't— it's not necessarily owner duties, you know, bookkeeping, sending the invoices, filing the payroll. You know, a lot of those [00:49:00] things they do just because they chose to and didn't realize that they could outsource it. Nice. Cool. Well, I know the team's working on some other fun stuff for you. I've gotten some previews. So, but it's good, you know, like learning our, like, you know, criteria and looking under the hood and then realizing like, you know, maybe construction isn't something that we love too much. So, you know, kind of exploring like, is that, how do I feel about that as an industry now that I've looked at that? So not only looking at like the individual business characteristics, but helping the team refine the deal box and kind of get a sense of where you feel on those industries. If you like, um, if you're not sure, want to look at more of them, that sort of thing. So nice work on that.

Gil: Cool. Thanks.

Athena: No worries. Um, Polly and Steve, I think I saw Steve was dipping out. I don't know if he came back on, but I wanted to see how you all are doing too. Hey, Steve.

Steve: Hey, Steve's back on. I think Polly just stepped up because she's jumping on our phone, so. [00:50:00] I'm on, I'm on phone audio here. There you go. So.

Athena: Hey. So you guys got something you were excited about recently? How's that going?

Steve: Uh, it's going well. We're, we're in the midst of, um, doing, we're gonna be doing the LOI and we're in the process of, of doing that. But we're, we've been modeling out this, uh. Opportunity and really walking through the modeling process together and learning it and all of that. And of course, you know, that that comes step by step. So it's going pretty well. Um, Steve and I had, uh, well, we, we sat down together today and went over everything and he had typed in the, um, uh, in our, in the Slack a question. I think it might have been two questions and I'm going to let him go ahead and ask that because I'm actually driving right now. So I'm going to let him go ahead and ask those questions. Um, if, you know, if it's appropriate to bring that up and, and, um. Uh, in the [00:51:00] conversation right now, so I'll turn it over to him since he's sitting in front of his computer. So,

Athena: yeah, absolutely. But before that, I just want to like, celebrate where we're at. We're doing financial modeling and getting together and it's amazing. I'm super proud of you and I know Brian's been working with you, but like, that's— it's a big testament to how far you've come. So I'm super excited to hear that. And yes, Steve, we've got a few more minutes. So ask the questions here if the team hasn't had a chance to get back to him yet and we can discuss it. And then, uh, you know, team will follow up on the channel if it's a more in depth one.

Steve: Yeah, so just a couple of quick things. So 1st off regarding— yes, we are living in spreadsheet hell right now. Um, I think, uh, Joe mentioned Ryan talked him off the cliff earlier last week. I think Ryan is trying to kick us over the cliff right now. So, to get where he's going. So, either way, we're, we're working through it. And it's been a, it's a good experience if nothing else. Uh, [00:52:00] you know, long or the short of it is, you know, the particular business that, that we're looking at was, you know, presented as a 19 year old business. And as we started digging through the numbers, it's really a 19 year old business that's about 3 years old and only profitable for the past 2. So that, you know, changes a lot of, of, you know, some of the thought process around it. But what's interesting is, and Ryan, sorry, I wrote you a novel. And, uh, Slack. I'm gonna try not to do a novel, but it's a novel, but I'll keep it really quick. So, and I don't know how you've seen this before, but in the particular, when we're trying to model this out. So there's 2 things, right? I'm gonna keep it really basic. You've got revenue. You've got cost of goods sold, right? So what's interesting is the supplies of the cost of goods sold as they sell more, they hit a different tier as far as purchasing power. So their pricing changes dramatically. And I think I'll just do it off the top of my head. But for example, in 2022. Uh, on [00:53:00] the revenues they had in 2022, there are one tier and the cost of goods sold, the materials were about 63 percent of the actual revenues. I know there's a lot more factors going into revenues, just I'm just trying to keep it simple though. And then when they stepped up and now they're at the top buying tier, supposedly, uh, where they get the best pricing. In 2024, their cost of goods sold compared to revenues is about 33%, 32, 33%. That's a big difference. And what I guess what I'm trying to do in the concept of trying to de, uh, financial model and taking into account all different scenarios, how do I, uh, de risk that? And, you know, that's a whole separate topic, right, we've been talking with Ryan about, but when I'm trying to run the model, two variables, and I just said, okay, this breakpoint, maybe the assumption in the model is, it goes up to this percentage of the revenue, and at this breakpoint and [00:54:00] above, it's at this other percentage, so, and I'm just trying to figure out, what I do is I get in the spreadsheet, I break a bunch of stuff, I back, back up again, then I go back and try to get it so I don't break it again. But that's something that I'm trying to, I guess, a multivariable, because it's not just as revenues go up or down over the years, it could affect the actual costs in the model as well. So that's what, um, that's where I'm going through right now. Again, I wouldn't have thought about this two weeks ago, but as we started looking at the numbers, you start looking a little bit more finely on it.

Athena: Yeah, I mean, Ryan knows the specifics of the deal. I can speak to the breaking the model and the variables, right? Is there anything you want to add? I know he'll probably dig into the specifics with you on on Slack too, in terms of analyzing the numbers.

Ryan: No, mainly just that. Um, instead of, like, breaking and then going back, I would just say, make multiple copies so that you can see what does it look like at this margin? What does it look like at this revenue? Um, and then you can kind of [00:55:00] pop each one up and play each scenario a little bit differently. So I think you're, you're doing it the right way. But sometimes it's easy to remember— it's easy to forget. Wait, what was it at margin in 23 versus margin in 24? So just make multiple spreadsheets so you can compare.

Athena: Yeah, I would agree with that.

Steve: I don't know if anybody's run through it, so again, it wasn't trying to get into a specific deal, but it's just a scenario that I hadn't heard yet.

Athena: Yeah, it's, um, so one of the— I actually got a preview. I think I've told you all I'm working on a new financial model spreadsheet that gives us a little bit more firepower in terms of being able to do, um, different, uh, different situations. Right? So currently. The spreadsheet that you have, you're only able to put one revenue growth rate, for example. Now, if you go into the P&L sheet, you'll see on the top. Um, it has a percentage under each year. That's the revenue growth rate that you set on the [00:56:00] modeling tab. So you can actually go in and set a different percentage. Like, if you wanted to do, um, 0 percent on year 1 and year 2, and then it will still calculate like maybe a 3 percent growth after that if you use that so you can try not to have it so you can manipulate things, but to make it easier. But that is downfalls of this current template is like when you put the revenue growth rate. It's like across all 10 years. So if you go into the P&L tab in the yellow section under the years, you'll see a percentage. That's the revenue growth rate percentage that you set on the main financial modeling tab. If you go in and just add the percentage that you want there, that gives you some variability if you wanted a very, you know, years on the same model, but just like Ryan said, I would recommend just keep making copies of that spreadsheet and trying, you know, different scenarios, um, you know, and that way you can model like, well, what would it look like if I were to do different amounts of seller [00:57:00] notes? Or what would it look like if I were to do a higher purchase price or put more money down so you can do a base assumption and then make copies of either that or the original template so that, you know, if you mess up the formulas on one, you can keep making some other ones. But, um, you know, you're doing the right thing. You're getting in there. You're messing around with it. The first couple times it's really painful and that's where y'all are at. You're like learning it and you're looking at numbers differently than you, than you've gotten to before. So that's something everybody will go through. It's like, I found the one, right? Now I need to figure out how to actually model it. And it hits differently when it's like, yours, you know, versus just watching other people do deals or looking at the modeling or watching a webinar or whatever, like, it's different when it's your own. So when you get those models filled out, you know, Ryan will work through them with you and talk through it and help you troubleshoot or look at different scenarios and that sort of thing. So I think the big thing is like, [00:58:00] you know, good for you for, like, getting over that hump. Putting the numbers in, starting to manipulate it. It is hard at first, but the more you do it, the more it'll start to get easier. And I know it— it can't come soon enough, this, this new, you know, template that I'm working on. So in the meantime, you know, lean on Ryan. He's going to tell you like, hey, fill in these numbers, do this. He'll assign you homework. And then when you get on calls with him, you can work through it, you know, a little bit deeper with y'all and show you different ways of using those templates while we're waiting for the new, more straightforward, hopefully easy to use and more firepower template to come through in the next couple of weeks.

Steve: I will say that that acquiring— Okay. Sorry. I was just going to comment on the, uh, the Acquiring Minds, um, template— the, or the, the model video, I guess, um, you know, explaining that those 2 guys were are really helpful to me because, um, it, you know, I can just kind of go at [00:59:00] my own pace, take notes, that kind of thing, go back, rewatch and that kind of thing. So that was, that's been super helpful for me. Yeah,

Athena: yeah, great point, Polly. We love for you to watch it and kind of experiment with it while you're waiting for, you know, deals to start as part of your homework. But also you can go back and watch that webinar while you're plugging in numbers because we use that as our base template. So, you know, we use our template, but like, watch that webinar. It's like the base and then when you're doing it in real time on a real deal, you can kind of, as you just mentioned, like, watch it, pause it. You know, see that whole thing, but, um, we're here to help too. So I think it's great. Y'all are modeling and getting an LOI together. It's super exciting and big leap forward from where we were. So, you know, this is, this is the big time you guys are doing it. It's awesome.

Steve: I should have paid attention in accounting. So, well, I think it was Joe again who said he loves accounting, etc. I'm more the back of the napkin, all in my head type of [01:00:00] stuff. Uh, you know, I'll get close to the number, but it gets really precise when you hit spreadsheets and, uh, but I, I think the, the bigger message is— You know when you're looking at a deal and you get to the next step it becomes real and you actually learn it instead of watching videos and so the application of it whether we do this deal or not is irrelevant. Uh, you know, but and and also uh kudos too because— Somebody mentioned that I don't know if it was Ryan or Athena. Somebody said mentioned that you know when the new year starts the deal flows are gonna start picking up. So we're— We're looking at different things and, and really, you know, getting to that next level. So excited about that. So thank you all.

Athena: Yeah. Thank you, Steve and Polly. Excited for where you're at. And that, that's the thing is like, as much as we can get you listening to webinars and podcasts and that sort of thing, it's different when you're doing it in real time on real deals for you. That's why the calibration period and getting your reps in and taking a deal as far as you possibly can before any like major deal breakers is like great, you know, [01:01:00] to be able to learn and get further in the process because then when you do find the one, you know, what can often happen is people aren't moving fast enough. It feels like they're moving fast, but they're learning and doing it at the same time. And especially for on market deals that are very competitive. If we haven't gone through this process or taken it far enough that we know what to do when we find something, then often we can end up losing the opportunity just because we're, we're slowing things down by learning, which doesn't feel like we're slowing it down. But in, in deal time, it is slowed down. So, um, great work. Um, awesome. So we're, we're pretty much at time. Now, I just want to plug that Chris from Midwest CPA is going to be coming back on Thursday. He's going to be doing a walkthrough of an actual QoE report. Um, so you can see what it's going to look like, and then he's also going to be talking through work in progress, which is something we were just talking about with Jason, like if a seller is [01:02:00] like taking money and then, you know, delivering deals and you're taking over or delivering, everything's a deal, delivering work, uh, while you're taking over the business, then that work in progress is going to be really important to figure out, and we're going to spend more time on working capital. I don't think we can talk about this enough because it's just— our job. It's such an in depth, but really important conversation. So that's going to be next Thursday. I have gotten a yes from my friend that I mentioned who's over a year into his acquisition. Um, so we're just getting him scheduled for some dates. Also, uh, just chatted with a SBA broker who has a ton of experience who's going to be coming and doing a learning opportunity for you. We're reaching out to a few other people, so we're just going to keep plugging in these experts. But I hope you liked the format today where I just call you out and start picking on you because I certainly enjoyed it and it's good to hear. You know, for everybody else where you're at, what you're learning is the challenges that you're facing in real time on these deals. So thanks for being brave and letting me do [01:03:00] that. Um, and we'll do that in future ones. Obviously, always on the Tuesday calls is normally when you have the open time. So if there's anything in particular you want to deep dive on or you want to pull up a financial modeling template or anything like that. It's cool to do these things in real time and work on them with you. So I'm really excited. Lots of movement happening in the new year. Um, we will see you on Thursday for yet another. Fascinating financial discussion. I know none of us paid. I didn't pay attention in school, but I absolutely love it now. So, uh, we'll have Chris back on Thursday. Um, oh, and August sent the link in buyers club, but if you weren't on Chris's original call, I would highly recommend that you rewatch that it's on your dashboard. She shared the link so you can catch up on what he's talked about already on QoE and financial due diligence. So this is kind of the part two follow on for that, that we're going to be doing on Thursday. So thank you all so much. [01:04:00] Keep moving on these deals— it's exciting. Uh, and we'll see you on Thursday. Okay. Thank you. Bye.
