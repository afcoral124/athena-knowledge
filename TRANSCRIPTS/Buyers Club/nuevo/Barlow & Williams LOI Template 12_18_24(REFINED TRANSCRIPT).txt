Athena: Cool. Well, thanks for joining us today. Really excited I think we might need to mute Chris there, Anke.

Um, so we're really excited about this conversation today 'cause there's quite a few of you that are marching towards an offer. [00:01:00] Um, those of you are a little bit more experienced like Lindsay, who are under offer and have closed on businesses. So, um, what we are, um. Wanting to get out of today's session is a meet some of our favorite lawyers in this business that are super amazing, um, in this space, especially with first time buyers.

And we've worked with them on creating a template that has all the little things that we'd like to see in LOIs so that the whole point of this is a, for you to feel more prepared when you're ready to make an offer. Um, that you're able to do it more quickly and engage with amazing people like Bill and James David, when you're at that stage, so Bill and James David are Barlow & Williams Law Group.

They are now famous thanks to Acquiring Minds. So you'll have seen the many webinars that they've done there. And as, you know, Will is scrupulous with who he recommends and the people that he brings into his world. So that in itself [00:02:00] is a huge accolade, but. They have specifically helped multiple clients of ours, and we're so impressed with how they do things and the way that they're doing things differently than other people that we're seeing in the space.

So, really thrilled that they're come in today to have this intimate session to a, give you a template that we hope is something that you're able to use and be able to put offers out more quickly and confidently, but also to be able to talk through. Um, some of the common, uh, challenges that we see people having, particularly on the legal side.

So the way this session is going to go today is I'm going to hand over to them to do an intro, kind of talk about how to engage, when to engage and talk you through the template that we've put together. And then after that, we're going to have a discussion of common challenges and leave tons of time for your questions.

So if y'all can do me a favor, if you have a question. Hold it until we get through the template part of it, because it might get answered as they're talking it through. And we're going to make sure we leave plenty [00:03:00] of time for questions there, too. So, uh, without further ado, James, David and Bill, will you take us through this amazing discussion that you have planned for us today?

Bill: Yeah, happy to do that. So thanks so much for the intro. So I'm Bill James partner. Uh, we'll be walking you through things today. So what we're going to do is. Just to kind of set the tone. The 1st thing we're going to do is we're going to talk a little bit about just the questions of when to engage the attorney, uh, sort of went to use us in this whole process.

And then, once we're, we're kind of gotten that, that beginning part down, we're going to jump into the LOI, and then there's going to be lots of discussions and questions. Um, so I think, um, we'll just start out, by the way, just in case you haven't noticed. Barlow and Williams, I'm Bill Barlow, that's James David, uh, uh, Williams, we're both attorneys, we were classmates together at Harvard Law School, I went to work on Wall [00:04:00] Street, he went to work as a litigator in D.

C., and now all we do is mergers and acquisitions in this space, so that's, that's sort of our shtick. Um, a question we often get asked is when in the whole search process do you want to engage an attorney? Um, and, uh, what I would say with this is number 1, it never hurts to reach out early, right? You can always just kind of say, okay, I'm just starting to build my team.

Just wanted to kind of introduce myself. Typically, when we have people that reach out early, what we do is we say something along these lines. We say, you know, we're happy to help you build out. If you have specific questions on your template, et cetera, we're happy to have a discussion on that.

Realistically, um, after maybe one discussion with an attorney, you should be able to be sending out LOIs effectively on your own. You might have run into one or two issues where you feel like you need an attorney consult, but for the most part, you should be pretty confident [00:05:00] in sending out LOIs on their own.

Typically, when we get brought in is when you have some positive feedback, so it looks like you're like, in the running 1 of the close 1 or 2 and maybe the seller is sent back a red line and at that point, you know, you kind of want to finalize things finalize the LOI, get started on the process or maybe you've had the LOI actually signed.

And, uh, you know, at that point, you definitely want to get, um, you know, a lawyer involved. And that's usually a point where we start, you know, actually getting an engagement letter and getting formally engaged, uh, in the process. So, what part of what we're trying to do today is before you formally engage us, you're going to be sending out LOIs.

Obviously, it would cost too much to have an attorney review each and every 1. and so we want to equip you with the tools you need in order to be able to, you know, successfully do that and avoid, you know, some of the common [00:06:00] missteps people make at that that part of the process.

Yeah, and so, uh, I mean, James David will probably take it away and start talking about the, uh, template and the other stuff that we'll, uh, we'll start doing. 

James David: Yeah, so now can everyone see the screen? I'm always worried about screen share. Okay, so this is the current version of the LOI template on the left, and then on the right is recreated footnotes, um, based on some feedback from Athena.

We're going to be making a new version in Google Docs that works better with, with our workflow, but this is what we have right now. So this is what we're going to go with, um, as a general rule, as we, as we go through this, anything in yellow and there, you'll notice there are a lot of highlights, right?

Yellow, you'll fill in with [00:07:00] information and then green. Okay. Are notes to the end, uh, so in notes, which to make it easier for this presentation. I've also put in this document on the right. Um, okay,

so we start. Always nice to put their name, uh, make sure you spell names correctly. I have seen a couple where people misspelled names of sellers or names of companies. Don't be that person. Uh, cause it puts off a bad. Is people that sense, uh, from the very beginning we want to make it. Clear what sort of transaction we're thinking.

So this is written as an asset purchase, which should be your base. Sort of base transaction form is just an asset purchase where you'll be purchasing all of the assets of the business. [00:08:00] But as you can see, there are two footnotes or 2 end notes here. Right. And so we have a language. Right. We have instructions for different kinds of transactions.

All right. So if you're doing a stock sale, Or buying the equity, right? Then there's a number of changes that you'll make through the document. And then if you're doing a seller roll, seller equity roll, which looks like it's going to be much more feasible now under SBA guidance that came out just last week.

Um, but lenders are still digesting that we've, we've spoken with at least 1 lender this week, actually, who is not committed to this, but it looks like this is going to be possible, uh, which helps in, in certain contexts and then, all right, so there are a number of changes based on that too.

So anyway, and we're just, you know, clearing out names, [00:09:00] uh, buyer, you know, it's okay if this is just you as an individual at this point. If you have your LLC form, it's fine to include it here, but it doesn't have to be. Um, and then the seller name will vary based on the transaction structure. This first paragraph will change based on the transaction structure also.

Um, now I'll edit, I'll need to edit this a little bit just to Make this, we'll change the heading to, but anyway, uh, then we get to the purchase price, which this is the most important part that the seller is going to read first. Um, and it may be the only part that some sellers read, so, um, some people like to bold and underline these numbers.

I don't really care about that, but, um, okay. And here's where your headline number will go. So this will be the, the overall purchase price. And then we want to, the, the really important thing is that we break down the purchase price, [00:10:00] um, into its components. So cash at close, and then if there's a seller note, we want to include that here.

If there could be more than one seller note here, um, if you're doing SBA financing, you're, you're a little more limited in your options, but if, if there is rollover equity, right, it needs to be listed here. That's footnotes or in note 3, or I guess it's about the, this is the note here. Yeah. So, for the note, right?

And we want to be specific on these things that we can, right? Include the interest rate, the term of the note. Right. All right, and the term of the note can be critical if you need to count it for equity injection for the SBA requirements, right? If it needs to be on standby, you need to put that in here and you can also put, um, contingencies around the seller note, right?

If if the seller note is going to be subject [00:11:00] to any forgiveness. For certain metrics, so here's a paragraph in the, in the notes of what it might look like to fully describe the seller note. Right? So it's a, it's a whole long paragraph by the time you actually include it all. It's not just 1 line. Even though it's only 1 line here, I also like, this is something I like to do.

Not everyone does it, but I like it when my buyers do it is to put financial metrics and time periods. In the description of the purchase price, right? So this will be something like, you know, this amount of EBITDA over the last 12 months, or this amount of revenue in 2024, or whatever combination of metrics you're using.

I find that putting it in here makes it much easier to retrade, um, [00:12:00] after financial diligence because financial diligence is going to show. In almost every one of these businesses that the finances aren't as reported. So, this is a nice way to do that. Another thing that here that is really important is to talk about working capital.

In the LOI, because if you don't, it will be to your detriment later. And working capital can look and, you know, as you see, there are 5 different in notes about working capital. So, uh. And this is that it's because they're different scenarios. But, um, yeah, right. There we go. Always address working capital.

As an initial point, I don't like to put a number. On this, because you don't know what the working capital needs of the business are at this point. You never do [00:13:00] because you've not seen a deep dive in the financials. There are. Some brokers who insist on you putting in a number, in which case, let's put a range and try to build in some cushion.

Don't commit to a number, because if you commit to a number for working capital, it has the same psychological effect as committing to a number up here in the headline purchase price. The seller's anchored to it, and then you're stuck. Um, and but other things about working capital that can sort of depend on the business.

All right. So sometimes you need a portion of the working capital to be in cash, right? And not just accounts receivable, um, sometimes that it's really about inventory. If it's, you know, doing a lot of, if it's a retail store selling physical goods, it can be that it's really about inventory, in which [00:14:00] case it's not really working capital, but kind of lump it together for this and you need to address what happens with the inventory, right?

Is the inventory included? Are you purchasing the inventory on consignment? Um, and then the same thing if there's, if it's a construction business, or we're doing restoration businesses right now for a few people where there are long term projects, right? That means that there's stretched out work and stretched out.

Uh, payments, so, like, that needs to be addressed and then prepaid deferred revenues. This is mainly for SAS. Businesses, something with subscriptions, uh, you want to discount from those also. Thank you

Then we get into a little bit of boilerplate. These next few paragraphs. Aren't as important because they don't really change that much, but you just make [00:15:00] it clear that you'll be, you'll be drafting the definitive agreement. The seller needs to keep operating the business prior to closing.

Sometimes you'd be surprised how sellers will take their eye off the ball. I've seen that kill more than one deal. Um, anyway, and then we want to say that it'll happen as close as possible. Sometimes, uh, brokers or People will want you to commit to a set closing date, and you can sort of soft commit to a timeline, but they need to understand that you don't control everything about the closing schedule, right?

It could be affected by your lender. It could be affected by your attorney could be affected by their attorney could be affected by how quickly they get you. Information and diligence, right? The, you know, so don't don't commit to a set [00:16:00] closing date because that can result in expectation mismatch. Um, the conditions to closing here, this is meant, right?

These aren't binding. And a lot of these things will end up in the. Purchase agreement, but this section is really meant to signal to the seller, right? What some of the really important things. So the, the end note here is talking about key employees, right? This could also be a key contract, right? If there's a big customer or something, but, but you're, and you would list that here to signal to the seller is like, Hey, I'm not doing this transaction unless.

You know, this employee is going to commit to stay, or this customer contract is in place, or whatever it is for the particular business. Um, the due diligence period, or due diligence paragraph, again, [00:17:00] not an issue. Some sellers get weird about the timing of this. Some sellers insist on adding language about that, that you only have access to things.

Uh, not during normal hours, but after hours. I've seen that recently a couple of times. So don't be shocked by that. Um, it could signal that the seller is not told their employees that the transaction is happening, which means that you're going to have to navigate that. Um, in in some ways, so, you know, every red line, every edit you get is a piece of information for the deal.

Um, so anyway, uh, next paragraph exclusivity is, you know, this is a little bit of a tricky. Thing, right? I mean, we'll say in [00:18:00] the end note that 90 days is sort of the baseline ask. Often it gets to be 60 or 45, right? Some people will push for 30. If you're doing SBA financing, 30 is not going to happen. Um, unless there's just the stars align in some crazy way.

Um, the real kicker here isn't the number of days, but the automatic extensions that we've built in. All right, so in this template, we've built in additional 30 day extensions unless. The seller opts out. Now, it is possible that the seller can just run the clock down on you and, you know, let this expire, right?

At least in this, they would have to notify you of that. But if the seller is going to play games around running the clock down on [00:19:00] exclusivity, I question whether they would actually go through with the sale anyway. So, and what will happen if you do get up to the end and. You know, here we've built in these automatic extensions, but it's, it's possible that they would terminate that, but you're close to a deal anyway, in which case you're probably, you're just going to proceed to close.

Uh, if you're actually close, the exclusivity doesn't, doesn't become a deal breaker issue. Um, termination, again, same. We've actually linked it with the exclusivity period. Uh, so again, like if, if, if the seller isn't willing to extend the exclusivity, then, right, the deal is probably off anyway. Um, we want governing law.

You know, not likely to be any disputes about [00:20:00] otherwise, frankly, there's, they would take a pretty rare world for that to take place, but. You want it to be your state or Delaware. Although the way Delaware is acting, some people were saying to use other states, but, you know, whatever use your state. Um, we do want to make sure that everything stays confidential.

And include, you know, if there was an NDA already, let's mention it. And this is really more to protect, you know, you want the terms of this offer to be protected, right? So they can't shop it. That's what this is for. How much can you really stop that? You know, our things really, how would you ever prove it?

But anyway, um, then the rest of this is largely. Just for the lawyers, right? I'm just saying that this part is purely legal. Everybody's paying their own [00:21:00] expenses. This part matters, right? So the only parts that are binding are the confidentiality and the exclusivity, right? So, in theory, you could have a lawsuit about, about that, but everything else can be retraded.

Then if there is any dispute, we want it to go to arbitration, which again, isn't likely and then you want to put an expiration date on it. Uh, the seller is going to ignore that, but go ahead and put 1 just so

just because they're there and then on the signature on the signature page, be sure that you go ahead and sign it before you send it. Okay. Um, I just, you know, in you'll very rarely will you just have a seller sign it and send it back to you, but you want that to be possible, right? And that's not possible if you haven't signed it in [00:22:00] advance.

Uh, and then we get into the end notes. So, uh, bill, I have now walked through the document quickly and then this is maybe the longest we've ever been on a call together without you talking. 

Bill: It tells you something about how I'm, I'm the blabber mouth and the relationship. Um, yes. So, uh, just a couple other things to yes.

Got some smiles and chat. A couple of things to address sometimes occasionally, there'll be an issue that is not necessarily come up. So, 1, 1, other thing to keep in mind is sometimes. You want to address real estate, so there are situations where they are just leasing it and if they're just leasing it, and you're continuing the lease, you don't really need to include that in the LOI.

So, you could just be silent, but if the real estate is owned by the seller, you need to describe. [00:23:00] Is the real estate part of this purchase? Are you buying the real estate together? Um, and if not, you need to negotiate. If you are, you need to say, okay, this amount is real estate. Ideally, this amount is for the real estate.

This amount is for the business. If you're not buying real estate, then you need to say, you know. You can say, like, we'll negotiate a market lease, but just know that that's going to be 1 of the 1st issues you, you want to make sure you get clarity on. Also, just a side note on leases leases are 1 of the issues.

That is not an issue in most deals, but we have seen a couple situations where the landlord is a 3rd party landlord refuses to give their consent and when that occurs. Um, it can kill the deal just flat out. And so just know that that's one of those surprise things. You might want to clear up at the beginning because there's like a 1 in 20 [00:24:00] chance.

It kills the deal, but like, you know, it's not that large, but like, you know, 2%, 3 percent chance is still enough that you just want to get that out of the way. You know, at the beginning, um, I think the other thing we'd like to do. I know we're probably going to open up for questions. Um, 1 thing I would just like to say as well is, you know, if you're using this template, reading it through, filling it out, sending it out, you're going to be pretty safe.

Um, where we see people getting into trouble a lot of times with LOIs is when the broker gives a LOI or sometimes even a purchase agreement and basically says, hey, you want to do this deal. You have to use our form. And the problem with that is that a lot of times the broker forms. Effectively means that you are committing to purchase the thing before even going through diligence, which is crazy.

Sometimes they'll require you to do like a down payment. Um, Yeah, so this is, [00:25:00] this is an example, uh, from one of our lovely brokers that we've seen, Peterson Acquisitions. Um, this is not, they will say you have to do it on our form. This is not nullify. This is a binding offer to purchase, um, which means if they accept it, then you're, you're already bound even before doing legal due diligence.

James David: And, and how you know this is insane? Cause this is a four page form and two of the four pages are just release of liability for the broker.

Bill: They really care deeply about, 

James David: because of 

Bill: course, in a, in a typical purchase agreement, that's, that's, 

James David: you know, and they're not the only ones. I did pull another example of, of a brokerage that's on our blacklist. Uh, and one of the things that both of these have actually is the notion of a quote. Neutral unquote 3rd party closing [00:26:00] attorney, and I would just say, I would just remind people or tell people there is no such thing.

If it's a supposedly neutral attorney, that attorney represents the broker, not even the seller, but the broker. Um, so it's an unfortunate practice that. Isn't even allowed in every state, according to legal ethics rules. But 

Bill: the other thing to keep in mind is that whenever when we have dealt with brokers in the past as well.

Brokers forms a lot of times are made to be create as few protections for the buyer as possible because if the buyer has protections and they could potentially see the seller and then they could potentially see the broker and like all sorts of things. So they, they're basically designed so that you get absolutely no protections.

Once, like, absent provable fraud, you're, you're basically out of luck. Um, and so, you know, [00:27:00] it's just, I understand why maybe for deals that are only like 1 or 200, 000, why you might, might, might need to do something like that. But for any of the deals that you guys will be looking at, it's just, it's just not a process that, certainly not a process I would be comfortable with.

Um, and probably just not a process you should be comfortable with either. So,

um, 

Athena: This is amazing. Did you have more? I was going to jump in and bring up some more questions. 

Bill: No, we, uh, we were, we were waiting with bated breath for your commentary. Athena 

Athena: amazing. Um, this is super helpful. So, um, I don't, uh, I don't know if we need to keep the template up. We can pull it up if there's specific questions to it, but I really appreciate you all.

Putting that together and running through. I think it's going to be so useful for everybody here. And we love it because we know that there's things in there that normally catch people out. I wonder if you can [00:28:00] speak to a few of the common mistakes that you see 1st time buyers do in the lead up to that.

Maybe everybody here can be aware of. Obviously, the, I would like to pull out the earnest money and template conversation, which you covered a little bit more, but any other common mistakes or things that you see people by the time they get to you and they've signed an you're like, I wish you would have not done that.

James David: So there can be times. I had 1 once where somebody. Didn't differentiate between cash at close versus deferred money, just put purchase price that was, that was a non SBA transaction, but in the end, he just had to pay it all at close or the seller was going to walk because of that. Um, I've seen people, you know, leaving out working capital is a huge 1 that gets people in trouble.

Um,[00:29:00] 

Bill: 1 thing I've seen is over complication, especially in the earn out. I will say this if you're having an earn out based on EBITDA, you're setting yourself up for a fight because there's multiple ways to count that sometimes that works a little in buyer's favor, since you have more control. But I would say that.

And in general, if you're creating a pretty complicated structure, I have a rule of thumb. If I'm having difficulty following it, then, you know, I It's too complicated and you're, you're, you probably want to make it pretty simple. So, yeah, I think 

Athena: if you're if your lawyer can't follow the structure that you're putting together, chances are, it's a little too complicated for everybody.

So I would echo that and also just to pull out some of the terms that you use. So. I'd say everyone here is likely going to use SBA and their [00:30:00] structuring. So, um, with the, you know, we, we teach them performance based notes. So you've seen that in some of the deals that our clients have used, which is similar to an earn out, but only allowable under certain circumstances.

Um, but I'm of the, you know, SBA is going to look at any bit of target, but at least how you're defining it. I like seeing revenue because then you're not arguing. Over ex like expenditure in the business, I think is what you were alluding to. So, yeah, and then we're, when you're set an EBITDA target, it's like, well then this seller can start arguing with you over reinvestments or what money that you're spending so that they hit their target as opposed to revenue, which is clear.

James David: Yes, we're dealing with that right now with, uh, an unfortunate situation. But, um. It's also, if you are doing SBA financing, and again, we'll just kind of assume that people are for this conversation, you need to make sure that the mechanics you're proposing for the seller note [00:31:00] fit what you want, right? So, if you, if you're wanting things to count for the equity injection, you need to make it clear that it's on the full standby and amortized, you know, whatever, right?

So we actually encourage people. When possible to run the by your lender before sending it to the seller. Now, we understand you may not have your lender lined up at the point. You're sending out otherwise, but I have seen that affect people, right? As far as not including the right terms. Initially, because if you have to change it later.

It's going to be to your detriment so that that's something that's a little bit more technical, but is important to get right. 

Athena: Yeah, we do. Um, that's how we coach folks here is like, you know, do the financial modeling to make a deal that that works for you. [00:32:00] Get it together, put it into your make sure a lender, like, green lights that there's nothing in there that SBA would be like, no, you absolutely can't do this.

And then once you sign your, then you can go and get a little bit more deeper into the weeds to get your commitment letters and have the, the lenders look at the finances and stuff. Because we know we have limited access to finances at that point. Um, something that I wanted to pull apart, not pull apart, but just like, um.

Spotlight that you discussed is that almost always after you get into diligence, the numbers change. So, you know, can you speak to when that's like a deal breaker fraud versus this is pretty common and usually happens and what people can think about there with numbers potentially fluctuating after and when they should.

You know, I know you're not doing the financial due diligence, but from a legal aspect and what you see there, I 

James David: mean, I've, we have seen fraud, right? But not [00:33:00] fraud doesn't happen that much. We have seen it, but it does not is not common. It is very common for numbers to. Decline, right, often because of a, right, because SBA is cash flow lender, they can convert it to accrual accounting, and when you convert from cash to accrual, right, in a lot of these businesses, the revenues, the profits just drop.

Um, so don't be shocked if it's 10 or 20 percent declines. Right, if it's less than 10%, right, good on them. Right for the on the sell side. Um, uh, but, you know, if you're, if your model can't withstand. Right, a 10 percent drop a 20 percent drop. From financial diligence, and then it has to fit ideally an additional cushion for that J curve period after you're.

Acquired it, but just, yeah. The, the, the books are never [00:34:00] clean in these businesses. That's just not the nature of it. Um, and so just assume that it's going to drop and that's why I like to include the, the metrics and the numbers and the multiples in the LOI, right? Because it's, because it's like, okay, well, your purchase, my purchase price was based on your, you seller told me that there was this much revenue or this much profit, right?

That you reported this. I agreed to pay you. 3. 5 times that number. Well, as it turns out, that number was wrong, right? That number was off by whatever amount. And so, you know, I'm still willing to pay you this multiple as we agreed as I offered, right? But as it turned out, that number was wrong. So we need to adjust the purchase price.

Because I agreed to pay the multiple, right? That is a much more palatable conversation, right? It gives [00:35:00] you something to stand on, right? When you, if you need to have that retrain. Now, it could ultimately prove that the seller still walks, right? In which case, okay, right? You got to stick to your guns, but it, I found that it makes it a lot easier to have that conversation.

If there's something you can point to, as opposed to. The seller is thinking you're pulling it out of thin air. 

Athena: Yeah, I mean, oh, sorry, Billy, were you going to say something? 

Bill: No, I, I think I think that that is certainly true and I would also just point to 1 particular thing. That is always a question point, which is how much should you be basically putting in for the replacement cost of the seller owner?

Um, and that is almost operational as well. Where sometimes that seller owner is actually [00:36:00] wearing a lot of different hats, and it's very difficult to find a 1 for 1 replacement for that. And so, you know, it's easier to do that if the seller is truly kind of more of a passive role, if they are very active in sales and other things.

Then you need to be quite careful because you have two risks, right? One is if I replace them, how much is that person going to cost? And then there's the operational risk, which is, can they even be replaced? Right. Is that going to become an operational problem for the business? So whenever you're doing financials, always be focused on what the replacement value of the founder owner, what that actually is.

Athena: Right. And then to, to delineate, like when you do that. So I think a lot of folks. Get really nervous about putting in an offer, because what if I got the numbers wrong? Right? But in the way that you're putting the metric into the, it, it, we assume that the numbers are going to change [00:37:00] post L. Y. So, with the information we have available, which is typically only.

A sim and maybe a P and L, like doing it in this way protects you in a sense to have that conversation down the line when there's what you're calling a retrade, which is we're going to do an adjustment of the offer after we go through due diligence. So, I think a lot of folks are getting worried about about not catching things before they go into offer.

So they're kind of doing. Due diligence before they put an offer in versus I'm going to trust that to the best of their ability. They're telling me what they think it is. This is what I think it is. If this all checks out during due diligence, this is what I would be happy to pay. But if there's a change, then because I use that metric of you told me SDE was this much, then when I find out that it's much less, then I can have a conversation with them after I have access to more information.

And I wanted you to just talk through [00:38:00] what non binding means, right? Like, the LOI itself, what is someone committing to? What is the risk of signing an LOI to a person if they use a template like yours? 

James David: So, the risk for you as the searcher is not a lot, really, right? You don't even have any binding commitments at all in this document, right?

None. Right. I don't have the seller does. I mean, I guess you other than confidentiality, but you're not going to go telling everybody the terms of your own offer. Um, the, you know, so we, but but certain things aren't exactly non binding, right? It's it's not it's not nothing. Right there is psychology involved sellers will anchor to numbers.

Um, what often happens with sellers. Is they have a number in [00:39:00] mind, right? And sometimes that's a pre tax number. Sometimes it's a post tax number. Depends on the seller, but they have a number in mind. And if they get that number, they're doing the deal. They don't care, right? And if they don't get that number, they're not doing the deal.

Um, and and that sort of plays out, right? Which is why that. Purchase price number, right? People just anchor are to that. Um, so that. Is, is one of the areas and the same thing. It's why we talked about like why we don't wanna put a number on working capital unless we, you know, really have to, is because people anchor to those things.

Uh, so, you know, think about it as, you know, the, the Lois sort of the set point and then. Diligence ideally diligence is just to confirm and then you, you implement the terms of the yellow. [00:40:00] Right? And then, but diligence, if diligence shows a deviation, then we're going to deviate the terms, but the yellow, what is in the yellow.

Is the starting point, right? So, even though it's non binding. Right there, there needs to be some sort of justification for a change. In terms. Right, which is, again, why we opted, why we, why we like to have that multiple for the purchase price, right? That provides a, provides that justification. 

Bill: And in many ways, if you get the wrong, you know, you put a number in, turns out diligence happens.

It doesn't work out your costs in many ways are the cost of the diligence provider, which is usually the QoE. And then the cost of your time, because you're not pursuing other deals. And those aren't meaningless costs. Um, but that's also why we think a good rule of thumb is build [00:41:00] in 10 percent decrease.

In the, you know, metric and does this deal still make sense enough that you'd be willing to go through with it? Because if you're really at the knife's edge that any little thing is going to push it over, chances are something's going to push it over. If you have a little bit of that cushion, then, you know, you go through it and, you know, most of the time it'll, it'll end up working out.

And if it doesn't, you'll be out your costs. But if you're at the knife's edge, you're probably going to go through, pay that diligence cost, spend that month, maybe month and a half, and not really come out of it with anything except for like, you know, broken deal fees. So, you know, don't be so worried about it that you don't submit, but, you know, don't be so cavalier that you're just constantly incurring broken deal costs.

Athena: Yeah, I love that. And we, we kind of give them a process to try to eliminate broken deal costs. So, like, the, the sequence of orders, like, let's get the commitment letter 1st, because the bank is going to uncover [00:42:00] anything that, like, definitely is a deal breaker before we order the QoE. Um, so that's on everybody's dashboards too, if you familiarize yourself with it, but, like, you know, doing things in the sequence of order.

So you're not incurring costs, you know, that, that, like, the lender might uncover something that could kill the deal before you get into your QoE and we're going to have a QoE chat on. January 9th, we're going to go through a QoE report and talk about everything there and what diligence you should be doing before you reach the QoE.

So that's coming. So, um, for everybody here, if you have questions, start doing the raise your hand thing and the gestures. I have one more question while you're thinking of your questions and take advantage of them spending their time with us. So no question is not welcome here at any questions that you have about any part of this process.

But in the meantime, I want to have a discussion about Earnest money, like, what is your feeling about earnest money when should it be paid if ever and how can people, like, get a deal [00:43:00] under offer if this has come up and like, how do you see people bobbing and weaving to overcome it and then yeah, as they're talking about that, raise your hands if you have questions and we'll open it up to the group for more Q and a.

James David: I've been very public about my thoughts about earnest money. I think I've said it in more than 1 of the webinars. Um, this is not real estate. There is no need for earnest money. It has no place in these acquisitions. Um, that said, in several states, you have to have a real estate license to be a business broker.

And so a lot of these people, a lot of business brokers are real estate brokers, moonlighting as business brokers. And so they will import those real estate concepts. Um, the 1st thing is to tell them, I'm not doing it. Right? Uh, and sometimes more, more [00:44:00] time, more often than people think. If, if the broker understands that you're a serious buyer, they're okay with it, right?

So it really doesn't hurt to. I mean, it can with, you know, we showed you a few of the brokerages who do things their own way. Right? So they, they would reject that. Um, then we, we have found at some points that. You know, proof of funds or a commitment letter, right? Offering to do. To to show a commitment letter, um, on an accelerated timeline.

Right? So we're proposing a 90 day exclusivity window. Right? So, potentially. Okay. If I can't get you a commitment letter in 30 days, it lapses. Right. That's something you can offer. Um, and then we've seen a few times where people are okay with putting money in escrow, in which case it [00:45:00] becomes. Okay. What are the conditions for you to get that money out of escrow?

And where is the escrow held, right? Is it held by the broker, which is fairly common, what brokers want, which to me shows you what point of that earnest money actually is, but we'll leave that aside. Um, I've got a situation right now where a broker has a bunch of money and, you know, there's still, there's, there's all kinds of weird stuff going on there, but not clear what's going to happen because that deal could die.

And in which case, okay, what what happens to that money? Um, there have been times when, you know, the, so what you'll do is you'll list a number of conditions on that and it's what you want is basically just I can get the money back whenever I want, um, in which case, what's the [00:46:00] point of it anyway? But sometimes that's necessary.

With certain brokers, and so, you know, understand that the broker is not the seller, right? You, you will not have a relationship with the broker after the transaction, but you will with the seller. So, 

Athena: yeah, and just just to reiterate there. So that is a really handy tool. Like, oftentimes. Sometimes they're asking for earnest money because they're they want it.

They want confidence. You can actually close a deal in which case saying, like, as soon as we're signed, I'm going to go out and get a bank commitment letter. And if I can't produce, like, some more firm commitments that we can get financing. Um, then after 30 days, then, then we can, you know, and exclusivity there because brokers get worried about deals getting tied up for a really long time.

And it turns out that the person couldn't get financing at all. So that's a way to overcome it. And then I'll speak candidly, but, you know, if the broker wants to earn his money, it's to cover their fees. [00:47:00] So it's like, no, that's not what we should be doing here. So, um, I'm, I'm happy to read between the lines and we.

We feel the same. I don't think you should be putting earnest money down on on deals because it it, you know, it's not necessary if if it's the right deal. Um, and a good broker, so then, you know, if there's dodgy practices, like the purchase agreements that protect the broker, you know, these earnest money demands and that sort of thing, then I question whether it's going to be a good process or a good dealing the whole way through.

Um, so, you know, people kind of show you who they are, and we should listen. That's my thoughts. Um, anyways, Andrew, it looks like you've got your hand up. What question do you have for these guys? 

Andrew: Um, so appreciate you guys and all the content you've put out there. Um, we've, I've [00:48:00] absorbed hopefully at least 20 percent of it and we'll continue to get more of so, um, first off, thanks again for the, you know, the template that really the footnotes are great because the templates are great, but I don't want to start chat GPT in my way into some of this verbiage that I, you know, Would need for some of that to describe.

So, having some examples is extremely helpful. Um, 1 question you guys already answered as far as a kind of a blanket rule of thumb that 10 percent decrease and, um. Effectively earnings and to kind of book for that, just kind of based on your experience. That's so thank you for that. This is a generalized question, but you guys see enough deals at this point.

What are you seeing in the market? That's different than it was a year ago. And what do you think where's the where's some kind of? Deal features that are either changing, if at all, um, that you are starting to see being incorporated into more deals that are going to carry on to 25. That's going to make a big difference in the lower middle market.[00:49:00] 

James David: Deal structures have changed a lot, right? Because of some of the new SBA rules. Right, the partial buyouts and I mean, there's been another evolution of that just last week with that's going to allow seller equity role in a more traditional way. All right. So what what you've seen over the last year, year and a half or so as a, as a large shift from asset deals to stock deals or equity deals.

And now that's going to reverse back some, uh, which will be advantageous for searchers, uh, multiples have multiples or continue to change for different things. Right? Certain industries aren't as hot as they were. 6 months ago, 12 months ago, other industries are a lot hotter, right? And same thing with geographies, certain geographies have spiked and others have sort of petered [00:50:00] out.

But that's all, you know, it's hard to do any kind of broad global about that. It's more common now for investors to be involved in these transactions. That's that's much more common and is becoming more professionalized. We represent some of the larger investors in this world. Um, and it's sort of trickling down as far as sophistication there.

Because it's so that changes some of the deal structures. Um, if you can don't do don't take investor money. If you're doing the 7a program, right, if you can self funded, it just makes it easier for you. Um, there are great investors out there, but it just adds complexity and you probably didn't, you know, aren't looking to leave corporate and do the 7a route if you wanted, unless you wanted to be your own boss anyway, [00:51:00] so.

Bill: Although that being said, sometimes if you find a deal that is like the perfect deal for you, but, you know, it's a million dollars outside your buy box, you know, a lot of times the terms are actually relatively attractive. Um, and so, you know, being able to, you know, raise 100, 000 dollars to write that additional 10 percent equity check.

So you can take out a target that you really like, um, it's not the craziest thing in the world. So, uh, I would say, yeah, 

James David: it's also much easier than it was. 

Bill: Oh, it's yeah, it's, it's leaps and bounds and I think it's going to continue to get easier. Um, so, 

Athena: and I love that economics versus like, other investment plays, because it's still very much that ownership and control is with the, the searcher in these ones.

So, um, that's something that we do talk about with [00:52:00] clients, like, if they want to bring in investors, and I think the terms are getting more standardized and the banks are starting to get more used to on, like, I remember a year ago. I was talking to some of the largest lenders and they were like, what, what, what, like having investors in the mix, why?

And like, now it's, it's been popularized. So, um, I, I definitely echo that there's a lot more, um, you know, kind of, uh, understanding of it and formalization from, from what I'm gathering and a lot more investors come into this space. Cause real estate is not delivering what people thought. So there's a lot of, a lot of real estate folks that are coming here.

Um, Andrew, did that cover your questions? 

Andrew: Yeah, yeah, I've probably got a hundred more, but I'll let other people talk. Go 

Athena: for it. Please. That's what they're here for. So if you have more questions, otherwise, I have more that I can fill in the gaps while you all are thinking of some, but please carry on with questions.

Andrew: Go for it, Athena. 

Athena: Well, um, no, did you have some, like, this is for you guys. So I, I just have one's queued up, uh. [00:53:00] If if we were lacking air time on question time, 

Andrew: I, I actually do have another kind of a brief. I apologize that I'm asking these, like, broad scoping questions, but, you know, again, for those of us who are just consuming everything there is to consume right now, we always hear the preparatory side as far as.

You know, the bad, the bad examples of, you know, you know, brokers kind of doing in shady deals, the fraud that you guys were mentioning, if you're painting with a large brush on these deals that are getting across the table, I mean, is everyone playing nice in the sandbox here? 9 deals. Are those relatively, you know, are there more good sellers are out there than there are bad sellers?

It's maybe an easier way to say that. 

James David: Yes, but you will. Yeah. And and when the deals break down, it's 90 percent of the time. It's because the numbers don't check out. Right. It's it's because of the finances. [00:54:00] Uh, but that said, if the seller reveals who they are, believe them.

Right. And it, it, and they will. Because you're going to have a, right, if you're doing this SBA financing, you're going to be tied to them in some way, how much can vary, but you're going to be tied to them. And for these kind of businesses, you need this person to hand this over, right? This is not a done and I'm off to the beach, right?

So,

you can get a sense, you often get a feel, right? You need to have a relationship with the seller and if you get the sense that it's just not working, trust it. 

Bill: Yeah, I would say the deals where things go really south, um, there was. At least [00:55:00] indications beforehand, sometimes it might be small things and nickel and diming you on stuff them, you know, uh, becoming very intransigent about points being difficult to work with in the deal process.

When you, when, when somebody is difficult to work with in the deal process, granted the deal process is stressful, but if somebody is difficult to work with in the deal process, that's often not a great indication of a, of a, of a smooth post closing relationship. And sometimes it's more that than the actual thing you're arguing about.

It's more the fact that they are acting like that. That, you know, you need to double check and and make sure that it still makes sense.

Athena: Such a good point. Um, we just in our last buyers club call, we just talked about, like, the. Relationship stages with a seller and, like, really [00:56:00] try to emphasize that. Your relationship with the seller is just as important as the finances of the business, if not more, because, because you are stepping into their shoes, they've set the culture, they're going to be a partner of yours for the foreseeable future.

Um, so if you don't like each other, it's not going to be a good relationship. Um, you know, and in these small deals, it's not like there's management layers and stuff like that. Like the, the, the owner is the business, that is the personality and you. That's who you're going to be interacting with. But, um, I would say I err on the side of small business owners are running their business.

They're not running and doing all the things from the finance perspective to, like, keep the kind of books that we would like to see by the time it gets to us. So most of the time. Like, I think it's just a matter of they did what they could, you know, while they were running the business, but it is an enormous amount of work.

And I think I shared this with you all just to do our books. I have a [00:57:00] team member that spends a full time team member. That's been 25 percent plus an advisor plus, like, 2 other people all to try to keep the books up and. You know, like, I know how that should be done, and it's a lot of work for a small business.

So the folks that don't necessarily know how important it's going to be by the time they get to a sale. It's not they're covering up fraud. It's just they were running their business. And I think most sellers that we interact with, like, are honest and well intentioned and that's the whole point of doing the QoE is like, somebody that actually knows numbers can go in and rebuild all the financials and actually verified what they said.

Was there so that you can have a, a retraining conversation if necessary. Once somebody that that knows how to do all that stuff looks at it deeply. I don't know if you would echo that, but that's that's my kind of take is that they're just small business owners that didn't have the capacity to do the kind of audited financials that we might like to see in middle market.

James David: Yeah, I'm not, I'm not going to read into the [00:58:00] books being off. All right, but I'm reading into, you know, they're just, they're not forthcoming on the calls or read into the, to the interpersonal stuff, not the finances. The finances are going to be a mess. 

Bill: And sometimes keep in mind, small business owners tend to be optimistic.

Including optimistic about their own business optimistic in the sense of saying, oh, yeah, you can run this. It's only 10 or 20 hours and like. Realistically, if you actually add it up, it's a full time job and, and, you know, some of that happens during any off hours. And so sometimes, yeah, they, they, they themselves almost have a rosier picture of their own business than, than what is actually warranted by the facts.

And that's not necessarily deceptiveness, except maybe some self deceptiveness, but that happens. And sometimes it's heartbreaking because sometimes the seller, you know, thinks that they have a great, great [00:59:00] business, but in reality, they just have a job and like, you know, they're not going to get paid for the job that they thought they were and it's sad, but, you know, you, you as the buyer have to go in eyes wide open, realizing that the seller is probably looking at their own business through rose tinted glasses.

Athena: And some excellent point, um, Lindsay was just saying, or they advocated that role for so long that they don't know their books, which is also, you know, common. Like, they, they have a bookkeeper that, you know, is doing paper books for them for so long. And they weren't necessarily paying attention to it.

They were just doing stuff with customers or, you know, focusing on running the business. So, um, I'm, I'm less concerned about the, you know, You know, as long as it, it seems like if it's around here, this, this could work and then, and then you get to make those adjustments after you do diligence and kind of see what the real numbers are.

And then you can have a meaningful conversation with them with the [01:00:00] report to back you up and say, like, hey, so everything else is great, but we need to make some adjustments here. And that's after. So, um, I, I feel like a lot of people get in the weeds. For yellow, I wanted to, like, catch everything and do due diligence when, um, you know, really the risk, as you said, was, like, we're signing a non binding agreement.

So, as long as we do the sequence of steps in a way that we don't have, you know, a huge risk and broken deal costs afterwards, then, um, Um, then we'll catch it as long as we're following the process before we get to close 

Bill: and something else. I'll echo along with those lines when you have to do a retreat.

A lot of times the conversation goes. Look, any buyer is going to that hires a diligence firm is going to come up with the same issues, right? So, like, you going back to market is not really going to help you because you're going to be in the exact same place in 3 months. And so you like me, I like you, if you have that trust develop and you say, but look, like, this is, this is [01:01:00] just the reality of what your business is.

And that doesn't always work, but don't, you know, there are many times when retreads happen and the deal goes through because the seller realizes. You're right, like, this isn't just you being mean, this is just, this is going to happen regardless of of how I run this process. So, 

Athena: yeah, and oftentimes it's a much more fruitful conversation than it would have been early on, because now they've gone through this whole process with you.

They trust you. They like you. You have a report to back up what you're saying, as opposed to trying to have that discussion before you get an offer in. Right? It's like, Okay, well, you think it's this I'll make an offer based on this and then and then we'll get in there and see what it really is. But the relationship building goes so far.

When we get to that point that we have to have a discussion about, you know, well, this, this is, this is, you know, what, what was uncovered and it's not just me. It's like, these are the professionals that have found this and here's the [01:02:00] report. So you can look at it and see what I'm seeing. And, you know, I think you get a lot more, um, uh, like, it's, it's a lot, The better of a process at that point, because they've also gone so far down the track that they're, they're tired and they want it to be over.

He kind of 

Bill: works for you as well. 

Athena: Yeah, this is me. Okay. So, um, I know we're running a little bit over, but, um, 2 things that I wanted to chat about with you. Uh, that I think you also have interesting points of view on our stock versus asset sale and like the, the offer, you know, and whether that adjustment should be made on the purchase price, you know, so, like, can you speak to what your thoughts are on stock or asset sale and why these folks here should pay attention to what type of transaction that they're doing and why it matters to them.

James David: So there's some, you probably, if you read up on the, on the, that's on the Internet, you'll hear [01:03:00] about liabilities and, you know, you shed liabilities in an asset deal and that is true to an extent, but it's not as true as a lot of the materials suggest. All right, you don't get rid of sales tax liability.

For example, a lot of employment liability is going to carry over regardless. So it's not as protective as people think. That said, asset deal should be your base assumption. Uh, and, and the biggest reason for that is actually tax reasons, right? Everything comes back to taxes. Um, so in an asset deal, you are able to depreciate the, your purchase price over, it could be as short as a year, it could be as long as 15 years.

It depends on what the assets actually are. But you'll be able to offset that against your taxes. So there will be tax savings every year. Right. If you buy the stock or the equity by the [01:04:00] stock or membership units, or, you know, if it's an LLC, whatever it is, then you're not able to have that same depreciation, right?

You, you, you have a higher basis so that if you were to sell, you're paying less taxes, but you're not able to, you know, in the interim, kind of get that money, depreciate that back. Right. So if you're doing a deal, that's. You know, we'll just say 3, 000, 000 dollars, right? And we can just flatline assume 15 year depreciation, which is the base, right?

It could be quicker than that. So that's 200, 000 dollars a year in income that you'd be able to offset in the business, right? So you then, you know, weigh that out, continue to do the math of what that is. And you can do all these calculations in a net present value kind of formula. I'm no [01:05:00] Excel wizard, but it is possible to do 

Athena: the financial modeling template that you all use assumes an asset sale.

So, it has that, uh. Amortization of the purchase price built into the model, so they do have a model that does that, but it's different for a stock sale, obviously, because that, 

James David: yeah, but we're talking about a difference of what could be, you know, 30, 40, 50, 000 dollars a year. Net, right? It could be smaller, could be higher, do the math, but that's a real difference.

And so if you do have to go the equity route, right? Likely to make your numbers work, your offer needs to be lower, right? To account for that delta. Now, that said, not all buyers are sophisticated and we'll do that analysis. We've seen, we've had clients lose deals because of, because they made that adjustment and we had to [01:06:00] kind of console them afterwards.

But it's like, okay, well, you stuck to your guns, you stuck to your numbers. Right. The deal didn't make sense at that higher number. Right. Uh, so, you know, know that that's possible, but if you do have to do a stock purchase and it's possible, you might write a, for example, if you're buying something that has a big.

Has a fortune 500 company that it supplies to, uh, say Walmart, it's famous for this, right? Walmart contracts cannot be assigned, right? So if the company has a Walmart contract, and that's an important contract for the business, then you have to buy the stock. Right that that's why that happens, but if that does need to happen, then you need to adjust the finances based on the tax benefits that you're foregoing as a result of the stocks.

Purchase structure. 

Athena: Right. Yes, great. An important conversation, one I'm sure we could spend a lot [01:07:00] more time on. But, um, one other thing, I'm curious your take on IOI's versus LOI's. I certainly have an opinion on if they should be used and when, but curious what you all feel about IOI's versus LOI's and if it matters or if it's a tool that should be used under certain circumstances, in your opinion.

Bill: I would say that IOIs are more commonly used on larger transactions. Oftentimes it's because you need an IOI in order to line up investors to see if that's a realistic possibility. If you're already at a point where you can do the financing between a combination of self funding and SBA, I don't think an IOI is usually necessary.

If somebody really wants to use an IOI in the process, usually a broker, fine, do whatever the broker says, but for deals like this, it's generally unnecessary, and you generally can just skip to the LOI. 

James David: And if there is, and again, right, it's often driven by the [01:08:00] broker, right? But broker deals, because if they were investment bankers before, they're going to be used to an IOI, LOI, bifurcated process.

I can't have more steps than that either, but. In the businesses that you guys are likely to be targeting, I think there can be room for an IOI if it's an off market deal, right? And the seller is not, you know, maybe not expecting this and is not kind of done the exercise of getting that number in their head.

All right, and I, which, which, you know, just like, this is sort of the headline terms. I'm thinking, right? Are we in the same ballpark, right? It can, it could be useful there. Um, but then you'd want to move quickly forward, but in an off market setting, right? Where you're going to be doing a lot more seller education anyway, um, and I, like, could be useful to [01:09:00] prevent you from wasting your time if the expectations are just wildly divergent.

Athena: Agreed. And then on market, you know, the difference that, that I'm seeing between IIS and Lois is like an IOI can be used against you, it can be shopped around. Um, so if you're putting on an IOI broker can do it and, and, you know, see if they can get better offers and use an offer versus an OIS is like, I'm serious.

There's an expiration on this, you know, there's a confidentiality attached to it. Let's go. Um, so, like, I don't know if you would echo it or not, but, uh, unless the broker's insisting on it. I like personally to go straight to because it indicates seriousness. 

James David: For an on market deal. Absolutely. And for most off market too.

Yeah. 

Athena: Yeah, but you don't want to spook the seller if they're brand new to this and they're on their own. So, an IOI might sensitize the conversation a little bit more. Right? So, it's, it could be a better play to be like, okay, so this is what we're thinking. And then the next [01:10:00] document is going to be a scary long document called an L.

O. I. and this is what's going to be in it and why, you know, so you kind of want to educate your seller at every point. And also, you know, Get an idea of how savvy they are and whether they'd be spooked by an at that point, but on market when there's competition, my preference is like, go straight to if you can so that, you know, put some timelines on it and they're not taking your and shopping it around.

Awesome. So I, I appreciate all of your time. Um, so how can these folks and we're, by the way, we're getting, we recorded this whole thing. So it's going to go on your dashboard. We're going to coordinate with them to get the LOI template. So you'll have that in the next day or two. So you all can start using that.

How can they best engage with you? When should they engage with you? Um, and like, are there certain things that they should bear on mind on whether they'd be a good fit for you all to work with you on their deal? 

Bill: Yeah, so there's a couple of different ways. Obviously, you can reach out to [01:11:00] Athena and kind of let her know.

You can also just go to our website. We have a schedule, a consult button, just schedule something and you can just put in your information there. Um, and we're more than happy to to jump on a call with you on on those points. Um, uh, we can put in our, our, or maybe Athena, we could share afterwards or LinkedIn and emails again.

Feel free to reach out. We're always. Always happy as service providers. We're always happy to hear from potential clients. So so don't be shy. Um, and and yeah, I'd say that that would be great. 

Athena: 1 other point that I think is unique about you all that might be worth talking about is is how you do your fees on transactions like this and why that's different from what you might get elsewhere and why you see it as a benefit.

Bill: Yes, thank you for reminding me to do my own pitch.

Yeah, so so we, we do not work on an hourly basis. We do flat fees and we do [01:12:00] them based on milestones. So you pay a certain amount at the very front certain amount when we, when we start drafting all the main documents, and then a certain amount of closed that way, you know, up front. Exactly what you're doing.

Um, you know, we'll typically roll a fee. So, you know, if a deal dies We'll roll it into the next fee. So into the next transaction And so, um, you know, that way, everybody knows exactly kind of what they're, what they're getting into. That's that's by far the way we prefer to do our deals. 

James David: We also find Athena's talked about sequencing sound like you all have access to quite a few sequencing resources, but the way we do it is an initial bit.

This kind of meant for legal diligence. Then we sit on our hands while your financial team go to work. Right. And then there's sort of a go, no go point after financial diligence, right? That's our 2nd milestone. And if you say go, that's when we draft all the documents. Right? So [01:13:00] if you work with us, or when you work with us, let me be positive when you work with us.

Um, you, you're not, you're not right. And we backload the fees. So. You're not out a lot of money illegal if the deal falls apart at the financial diligence, because we know, because we worked with a lot of searchers, like, that's where it's going to fall apart. So we've, we've built a structure around that.

Um, as far as size, right, whatever size you're able to do, you know, we, we do have some minimum fees. They kick in at the, if you're doing really small transactions, but, um, and then industries, we do almost everything. There are a few sort of hyper specialized things that we don't, certain licenses, like if you're buying a medical practice, we're not going to help you do it.

Um, we just don't deal with some of those things. Uh, we also don't do a lot of franchises. Just we find that we're not able to help a whole [01:14:00] lot in those situations, um, because the franchisor often dictates the terms. So we don't really do much of those. 

Athena: Something to pull out about the flat fee for you all is when somebody is incentivized by the amount of time that they spend on a deal, they're going to spend more time when somebody isn't like flat fee, they're incentivized to support you in the best way while conserving time.

Right? So it's like. They're the, the mindset of a service provider shifts for how can I work with my client the best way? It's another reason why we do flat fees as well. We're incentivized by purchase price. Then, of course, we're going to want you to spend more. So it doesn't make sense. So, I really like the flat fee model with service providers, because then they're incentivized to help you get the deal done.

Versus racking up the amount of time, which is kind of famous and in the legal industry is like, you get slapped with a crazy bill [01:15:00] of all the hours and that sort of thing. Even financial providers. Also, if they're doing an hourly for your, your QoE, your diligence, that sort of thing. Of course, they're, they're, they're not going to be concerned if they're spending too many hours, but when it's flat fee, they need to make sure that their margins.

So, you know, they're going to, you know, be really clear with you on what the scope is and that sort of thing. So I think it's really advantageous of you all to do that. And awesome. And, and, you know, from what we've heard from our clients that have worked with you and your reputation in the industry, it works really well, because then you can actually model out and know what your costs are going to be in that regard to versus, you You know, the hours just, like, absolutely going crazy love 

Bill: that.

And yeah, thank you. We, we, we're very happy with that model and we're hopeful. We'll see many of you guys work with us too. So, 

Athena: yeah, we'd love that. Well, thank you so much for this. This is amazing. Um, like, such [01:16:00] a amazing resource and for your time. I'm sure you'll be hearing from a lot of these folks in the future and, um, we'll share all of your contact details.

We'll get the L. O. I. template over to everybody. Um, and, you know, my, my have you come we're gonna keep doing these, these buyers club meetings. So there might be, like, opportunity to deep dive into certain topics and stuff like that. So, if there's anything that you'd like to hear from. Bill and James David on the future.
