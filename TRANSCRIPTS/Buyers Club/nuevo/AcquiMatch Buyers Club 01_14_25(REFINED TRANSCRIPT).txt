Title: AcquiMatch Buyers Club
---

[00:00:00]
Athena: Amazing. Joe, are you here too? I think I saw you log it in.

Joe: Yeah, I'm here. Hey, Athena. I'm just on my phone at the moment trying to get on through a computer if I can.

Athena: Yeah, cool. Because I know we want to chat through some stuff with you too. So I think we've got a smaller group today, which is fine. So Gil, hello. Um, I know it's, uh, like, just brand new into your search, but we're excited to have you.

I don't know if you've, you've met everybody on the team now at this point too. Ryan, Anca, Luke.

Gil: Uh, I've been in meetings with Luke, but I've never actually met Luke personally. So nice to virtually meet you.

Luke: Thank you. Great to meet you. I know you've been watching my videos probably.

Athena: Cool. So, um, we've started on these calls. We figured out like Thursdays is good for expert calls. That seems to be when most folks are available to join. And then Tuesday, just kind of open forum, talk through, like, current deals that you have any challenges. Um, it's really helpful for other folks to listen in on that sort of thing.

And everybody's, you know, confidentiality NDAs. So, if you ever have a problem that you want to work through, obviously, Ryan and the team are always there direct access, but I always join these calls too. So, might give a different perspective or can just add some support there.

[00:02:00]
Athena: Um, cool. So, um, just a quick update for y'all. And then, um, Joe, if you're ready, I know Ryan was saying that you had some, um. A deal that you wanted to talk through and just kind of brainstorm with us and see how you're feeling about it. Um, do you think you'll be ready to do that soon? Or should I fill fill some more time?

Joe: Uh, just, uh, give me, uh, two, three minutes.

Athena: Yeah, no problem.

Joe: To get the

Athena: computer on. I'm just getting it fired up now.

Athena: Totally fine. We've got a little, like, AcquiMatch update for you all. So, um, we, uh, the business started as, as my kind of search entity, and it kind of took off so quick that I just didn't get a chance to create a new entity for it.

So, um, and Unrestricted Ventures and AcquiMatch, we know that that was confusing. So it was like, AcquiMatch is a service delivered by Unrestricted Ventures, but we decided to fully commit to AcquiMatch. Uh, we've got a DBA, so we had to file with the state here in Texas to be able to, like, get a name change for the business.

So just a heads up. We're going to be announcing that tomorrow. Um, absolutely. No change for any of you. All of our old emails will work. Um, you know, everything is going to be the same. It's not—the entity is still Unrestricted Ventures. So, um, but it just has an alternative name that it's able to go by. Uh, the one thing that you will need to take note of Anca will be able to explain really quickly because it just might be a situation where you have to log back in.

But otherwise all our old emails still work. Everything works. We're just going to be referring to ourselves as AcquiMatch and kind of removing all references to Unrestricted Ventures so we stop confusing people that we're also investors. Um, Anca, do you want to just talk that through super quick in terms of what they can expect?

[00:04:00]
Anca: Hey guys, so I'll be letting you know, I'll send you guys both an email and a Slack message when, um, I am moving this Slack over to be AcquiMatch. So what might happen is it might kick you guys out and then it'll just ask you to log back in the same way that you logged in when I did the Slack onboarding call with you guys.

So, um, also in the message and in the email, I'll add a link. And if anybody is having any trouble, please reach out to me immediately. I will be there to help support you get back in on Slack. Everything will look and feel exactly the same, but now we will be AcquiMatch.

Athena: So just to clarify, we have to change the, the, the, uh, URL on Slack, so it should redirect if anything.

It just means that it will log you out and have to log back in, but you use all the same details. If you have any problem whatsoever, getting back in, please feel free to email Anca and she can get you sorted out. But that should be the biggest interruption on on your side. Any questions concerns from y'all's in before we dive into looking at Joe's deal that he's working on.

Cool. Great. Cool. We're excited. Should make it a little bit more straightforward to than trying to explain the differences between the 2. so we're all excited here. Awesome so can you spotlight Ryan and Joe and. Ryan and Joe, maybe you want to kind of tag team and just where you're at. Okay, great. Um, I'm not sure where the challenges are, uh, Ryan, maybe give an overview here 1st and then Joe, if you can fill in like.

Where are you at? What would you love to chat through with us here? How are you feeling about next steps? Um, and I'd like to take an opportunity to just kind of pull out where you're at and have a teaching moment about presenting numbers and the ways that we can kind of waterfall that to arrive at the number that we want with a seller to so.

Spoiler alert on that, but I'll probably pull out an aspect of where you're at right now to see if there's an opportunity there to, to try some negotiation.

[00:06:00]
Ryan: So, to start off here is that this is an off market deal that we've identified for Joe. That would be a good fit. Part of the process of when you're talking with an off market. Sellers, they, a lot of times they don't have an idea of how much they want to sell their business for. They haven't. They may be toyed with in their head, and then they start conversations with us, and that's the beginning.

Um, and so 1 of the things that we do is we give them a rough idea of what that valuation might be before moving them forward to introducing them to you so that we can just identify if you guys are someone in the right in the, in the same ballpark, um, you will sometimes get to speak to an off market and they're way out of range and it's just not a good fit.

Um, in this case, um, the owner on the call, I just asked, you know, what kind of number would make you happy more or less. And he said 2 million dollars and based off the financials that we have looked at, that was completely reasonable. In fact, um, almost a little bit surprising, um, he would let it go for 2 million dollars.

So I thought it was a great opportunity, introduced it to Joe, me and Joe discussed it. Joe agreed. He's like, hey, let's, let's do it all with the, uh, seller, learn more, we set up a call with the seller, uh, had a really good call, uh, with Joe and the seller got to build some rapport, um, and, uh, learn a little bit about the business.

We concluded that call, and, um, at that point, I did a follow up call with the seller to see how he was feeling about the process so far and let him know what the next steps in the process would be. Um, and at, on that call that I did the follow up call with the seller, he kind of, he. Let me know he was very happy to meet Joe and enjoyed the call, but he now wanted 3M dollars instead of 2.

I kind of said, hey, you did tell me 2; 3M is a pretty big push there. Kind of where's that coming from? And, you know, are you certain that's what you want me to feed back to Joe? That's a pretty, you know, it's a big push. Joke to just say, I want an extra 1, 000, 000 dollars. It could honestly alarm Joe and just be like, I don't know if this is the right move going forward.

He said, well, you know what? I'd be happy with 2 and a half million. So, somewhere I wanted, I want to know that Joe open to 2 000, 000 dollars before we even continue this conversation. I've already offered a lot of my time off essentially. So, I read that I relayed that information to Joe, and then Joe, maybe kind of.

Maybe take it from there with what your thoughts are.

[00:09:00]
Joe: Yeah. Thanks, Ryan. Uh, yeah, that was as of today. I mean, understanding where these new numbers were coming from. So Ryan asked that I take a look at my model again, which was looking really, really good. As you can imagine, based on the lower potential asking price.

Uh, and I really just gave, I just adjusted the numbers pretty quickly and saved kind of three different versions. My concern is that, Hey, is this right? Every time I'm doing the modeling, it's like, is this right? Um, and of course we only have numbers based on three years of P&Ls. We don't have tax returns.

We don't have balance sheets or anything else like that. Uh, Ryan, and I'm sorry if you didn't say this is a, uh, it's an HVAC, um, kind of a mix of commercial and residential AC company, uh, almost 20 years established, which gives me a lot of comfort, fairly small, only about six full time employees, three technicians, kind of a small fleet of vehicles, and the bigger part is.

It's actually out of my hometown. It would be about 45 minutes each way. And it's something where I would plan to, it wouldn't be an absentee sort of situation. It would be more around kind of working full time. So that's something I would have to kind of change gears on as well. But the numbers were looking good.

I guess I'll just do a screen share at this point is if I make the most sense for everyone and taking a look at the numbers. You're on mute, Athena.

Anca: Oh,

Ryan: sorry. I was just

Athena: getting that. I was, I was, I was talking to myself there. I was saying I was looking at him, but yeah, by all means, bring them up. Uh, yeah, let's look through them.

[00:11:00]
Joe: So, um, I mean, I, I could bring up the, the ones previous to the change in price, but I guess we'll just start with the, uh, the smaller request 1 1st, which is, um.

At the low range of what the, the, uh, seller was asking for. Anyone need it more blown up?

Athena: No, that's fine for me. I'll go a little

Joe: bigger. Okay, I like looking at as much information as I can on one screen. Um, I can start with the financial model, look at the pro forma info first, but it was, like I said, pretty straightforward.

We had 3 years of the P&Ls. Things were grouped together pretty nicely. Um, added back in the salaries and what he claims on the ad back sheet from Ryan on what his ad backs were accounted for a new rent adjustment, which is actually very attractive. Only 3000 a month is very low compared to other businesses out there.

Um, and I, I changed it on these new models, so I just readjusted back in my salary and benefits what I would like to see from that, knowing that there was money in there and he had something where he would be willing to, to lend out his, uh, contractor's license for HVAC until I were to get that. So I just anticipated it was from a previous deal.

I had 1200 a month or a thousand dollars a month. Just a placeholder, not a big number. And you can see what it does, you know, this is what we're looking at, adjusted ebitda, SDE. And then down to the uh, the pro forma adjusted so good healthy numbers, um Plugging in now really what? What 2.5 would be on the low range?

I mean the multiple is still at a 2.6 It's still very good reasonable and maybe I keep right now. We're talking about let's make it. Um So that it could be a lower seller note on the lower end So maybe if it seems either less risky or just maybe more palatable for him You And if he really wants that higher asking price, that's where I'd be asking for a larger seller.

So this one is 2.5 out of 5 percent seller. No, I'm not anticipating much capital expenditures. Maybe if it's like a half, call it a half a vehicle a year, something that effect again, don't have anything on balance sheets and tax returns yet to get an idea of assets. Tell me if I'm going too fast.

Athena: No, this is great, Joe.

Keep going.

[00:13:00]
Joe: Okay. I'm at a 9.5%. That was, uh, the last, uh, interest rate I got from a loan. I think it was from Live Oak or one of the others. Um, right now I'm, and I'm sitting at a 6 percent on the seller note, again, 5 percent of the asking price it's given me, um, a decent, you know, debt service of 1.6, a low 1.6 number. So plenty of, uh, plenty of room there.

Athena: Yeah.

Joe: And ultimately, you know, I like the idea of how you guys say, you know, this, the, I think it's this lower box, right? You want to be able to, if there's a seller involved, show them how much they would really be making.

In addition to just the asking price. Okay. 5 percent seller note, it's not a ton. They'd be making 2.53 over the term. And by the way, this is a seller that, you know, it took two calls in several months for Ryan to turn this guy. Um, so he, he was kind of slowly thinking about it and he's in no rush to sell, no rush to transition.

So this could be a scenario where, yeah, he may be, maybe he had more appetite for a, uh, seller’s note, see through the 10 years on it. Let's say, uh, possibly there could also be maybe a side performance sort of thing. I do it. This guy, I'm keeping it on, let's say, as a, as an employee, whether part time or something like that, make an incentive based program that's separate from the loan, but they don't see it like a performance base.

And that's how I can mitigate the risk and uncertainty and make sure, you know, he sees through a really good transition. Makes all the proper introductions and really helps me grow. And again, give him a piece of that growth. So I kind of see it.

Athena: Um, keep going questions. No, no, this is good. So far.

[00:15:00]
Joe: Otherwise, I was, I mean, so again, I made 2 other models, 1 in the middle and 1 on the high end, as you guys say, kind of stress testing the price ranges versus the debt service. And maybe what my seller notes would look like. So if I, I may just show this real quick. If I go to 2.7, maybe that's a threshold.

If I'm going with a higher, uh, offer price, that's what I'm 20%. I mean, is that unrealistic? Hopefully not, but that's where I start bumping up the seller note, right? Cause then that'll be bringing my debt service a bit down. These are really the only two numbers that I'm toggling, right. And just kind of resaving the new model so we can see what happens.

And this is actually an area I want to make sure I'm doing correctly. This box here, Athena, this only accounts for the first 5%, correct? And then down here, this was blank for some reason. This cell of mine, is this where I'm supposed to put, um, whatever, I guess the interest would be, and it, it auto calculates what the remaining 15 percent would be, which is four or five.

Is that accurate? Okay. Yeah.

Athena: And if it's not, if it's not performance based, then you might want to put standby at like one or zero years. If you're just bumping up the seller note, and it's just a seller note at a higher percentage rate. So, to be able to use it as part of your equity injection to lower your equity injection.

That first one that you just changed, you want to keep it at 2 years.

Joe: Oh, this one though? Okay.

Athena: Yeah, so that 5 percent can be treated towards equity injection. That has to be on full standby for 2 years, but if you're just doing like a straight up additional seller noted on top to save on that interest rate,

Anca: then

Athena: you might say, like, we'll start making payments after 6 months or, you know, after the 1st year, so they're not waiting an additional 2 years.

That's why we've split it out so that you can, you can mess around with, like, the payment terms there. Um, 1 of the other things you can do that we're working on on updating the financial models to give you more of these, these. Tools, so you can just plug and play, but if they balk at waiting 10 full years to get paid back, and this is a negotiation tool that you have in your back pocket is that you could offer a balloon at year five.

Right, and you assuming that you've made on time SBA payments, like, you, you can worst case scenario. If you don't have the cash in the business to be able to pay them a balloon, you can refinance and get them cashed out. Right. Using SBA

Joe: that would

Athena: that would roll into a separate or the same loan.

Joe: Yes, they

Athena: just refinance the total loan.

Yeah. So the owner, like, completely cashed out. So that's in a scenario where you haven't been setting aside. I recommend if you have it, you just calculate what you'd need to pay them out at 5 years. If you're, if you're saying a balloon, and you just set that aside. Right and then it's it's there if you absolutely need it, but assuming you've made on time SBA payments and the debt service still works, they'll refinance the whole thing at 5 years if you wanted, if you need to do a balloon.

So, I have some questions and thoughts, but what would be really useful to you at this stage? You want to sense check and kind of. Where'd it go from here?

[00:18:00]
Joe: Right? So it was like a question or

Athena: yeah. Yeah. What would be most helpful from from this conversation that we can help you with? I have some obvious, you know, I have some other questions, but I just want to make sure that we're supporting you and like, what would be good to talk through? Now, in terms of what,

Joe: yeah, on this one, it's, you know, you saw the adjustments here, but I think it's because it's such a bump here on the seller.

Note. You can look at what happened to the debt service actually went up a decent amount at close to 1.8 and then it drops down. So I just, again, it's trusting is am I doing this right? Is this accounting for all the calculations correctly? You know, other than that, I only just this afternoon, you know, did these, uh, kind of quick models just to test to see, would it be, uh, is it doable?

Would it be affordable? And try to figure out what levers to kind of pull.

Athena: Yeah, I mean, what's fantastic here is that that is your debt service after all of those proforma adjustments that you put in.

Anca: Right.

Athena: So, typically, we're, we're, we're doing debt service coverage ratio before you've taken out your 401k, your payment, all of those sort of things.

So, the fact that you've added that all in. And you still have this kind of debt service is awesome. Right? Um, so even having to go up to, if you had to, or if you felt like you wanted to go up to 2.7, or I think 2.9 was another model that you put in there. You're, you're still looking pretty healthy in terms of.

[00:20:00]
Your offer. Let me see the debt service. Yeah,

Joe: and it's a good exercise for me because you really realize, uh, the larger you go with the seller note really helps the debt service. My debt service is now it's still 1.7.

Athena: Yeah, and, you know, that's a 0 percent growth, you know, like, by year 3 is typically when you start bouncing back and you come out the other end of the J curve.

So, you know, even then the 1.38, that's after paying yourself all that stuff. So, like, if you're really in that kind of situation, like, would you be taking that much out in your 401k, or would you be reinvesting it into the business? You have a lot of wiggle room there. Assuming there's 0 percent growth, and it looks like they've had steady growth over the last couple of years in terms of revenue.

Joe: Yeah, and that's we didn't get into specific numbers on the 1st call with the seller. But good, you know, the, the. Not that it's a concern, but it was a sizable jump from 23 to 24. Um, especially in its profitability. So it's, and I was trying to literally line item compare and see where the difference is, where I noted a couple of things, but I kind of went here from the seller.

You know, and how sustainable that is, right? Or is it happened to be a fluke that's in his, his positive direction?

[00:22:00]
Athena: Right. So, I mean, where you're at now though, is it appears that it's a healthy business with good margins. It's growing. Um, the seller has given you a reasonable asking price price that frankly for HVAC in Florida, like we're seeing a trade at four plus X.

So to get something at like, you know, 2.5 to 2.8X is is fantastic. So I would say now it's about getting him comfortable enough to get into offer and exclusivity because when you go through the next phases. Then that will identify any major issues with the margins and if you need to retrade, you know, so it's like, hey, there's a little bit more risk here, or these things aren't what you said.

They were, um, also the, um, I saw in your notes that included 600 K in working capital.

Joe: No, that was an old that was the old. Industrial packaging things. So yeah, I just deleted that.

Athena: Okay. So what, do we have an idea on his working capital needs?

[00:23:00]
Joe: Well, um, last week's call was actually a pretty good timing where we were talking about accrual versus cash accounting, if I recall, and, and AR and working capital.

So I learned a bit from that. Um, this is the kind of business where the, the only way that there'd be, um, I think any accrual type of accounting going on is if he's doing. You know, selling a piece of equipment, deposit down, then you probably have to wait week, weeks for installing and then recognizing the rest of that revenue, right?

But the other part, call it, you know, service. Think of anyone coming to your house to do a PM or, uh, putting Freon in or whatever it is to service your AC unit. Um, before that technician's walking away, you're signing probably something either on a piece of paper or on an iPad where you're putting a credit card down.

So that transaction's happening right then and there. Uh, so I feel like it would be fairly minimal. That's one of my best guess based on the nature of the business itself.

Athena: So I would, I would get that question answered before finalizing an offer. Like, Hey, how do you get paid? Right? Like, how long does it take you to get paid?

Simple question, but it'll illuminate like, he's like, Oh, you know, they sign a thing. Then I invoice them 30 days later. And then we chase the invoice versus. They have to pay us before we walk off site. Um, very different scenario because the bank is that's the 1st thing they're going to look at is how long does it take them to get paid?

[00:24:00]
Um, which will determine how much money that you need to have available to you to keep the lights on while you take over the business. So, you know, Chris gave a really great, um, formula, which is, you know, find out how many days on average it takes them to get paid. Then multiply that, you know, divide the revenue by 3, 6, 5, and then multiple of the daily amount by the number of days it takes 'em to get paid, just to give you a rough estimate.

And then you'll wanna include that number into the purchase price. So what trips people up in the off market is the education of the owner about what all these things mean. So I don't love it to be like, a surprise when they get 1st time. I think it, you know, and you're, you're in sales, so you'll probably be really good at this, but to just kind of, like, tell them, like, hey, so this is what I'm thinking.

This is what this means. Like, you know, working capital is going to be included and, you know, so that will mean. If, if he has like, let's say like invoices, it'll mean like leaving invoices. And so the payments are made on day 1, when I take over to be able to pay the bills and pay your guys just walking them through everything they're going to see in the LOI and like basic terms in person so that the LOI is essentially like.

[00:25:00]
Cinching the deal, you know, like, there's no surprises in there. So I think that's the biggest thing in terms of the relationship with the seller at this point. Do you have any indication where he, like, jump from 2 to 2.5? Like, where that came from?

Ryan: No, he did mention on the call. You're like, well, HVAC businesses should be training at 4 to 5 X.

He did say that, um, so me and Joe, we kind of talked it through and, you know, Joe had to listen to the recording. So we're on the same page, but it It kind of sound like he said 2,000,000 on the call with me, and then maybe when he's getting some serious interest and Joe's in front of his face, he starts thinking, am I underselling my business?

Maybe he does some quick online research and started saying some 4 or 5x multiple stuff. He probably found this information and started spewing it. Um, and, uh, so I just confirmed with him. I'm like, hey, that's a big job. This is, you know, I'd hate to lose him off that. Are you are you set on that? Is that your numbers?

I think he came back to 2.5. 2.5 between the offers between 2.5 and 3. I'd be happy. Um, and so the idea here when me and Joe talk was like, let's put together some a couple of different just visualize a couple of different offers that not only gets them to 2.5. maybe we come with a few offers to show him some options to make him feel like he has some options here and make adaptations for both parties as you go up.

[00:27:00]
Athena: I think even at 2.9 or 3. And with these terms, like, you got a great deal. So, if, if the business is actually performing the way it is, and you like it, um, so what you can do, and this is the, you know, never split the difference. Uh, tactic and he actually credit somebody else. I can't remember the name of it, but you go in at 65 percent of what your top top offer is.

And then they'll be like, that's too low. And then you go back and you're like, okay, 85 percent of what that offer is. And then it looks like you're making a big concession, but you're still only at 85 percent of what your top offer is. And then if they still don't like that, then you can go 95%. And if they still don't like that, then you go 100%, but you make it super specific.

Like, okay, 2 point, like 2,952,575.25, you know, so it's like, you literally like, wow, this is super specific and they've really thought about this. So like, those are the kind of tactics that we can use to start low. And oftentimes you don't even get it that 100 percent mark because it looks like you've made two concessions already with the pricing.

So we know 2.5 is like, if you can get it for 2.5 with working capital included, like sign it, get it under offer and go through the process. Like to me, that's That's a no brainer to get it under exclusivity and keep moving forward and then have some lenders look at it before you order a QoE to see, like, you know, are they seeing anything that that would concern them if if 2.

[00:29:00]
5 isn't like a he's sign in and understands what exclusivity means and he understands what you want is to make sure that he understands. What exclusivity means, what working capital means, what seller financing means, so that none of those become issues down the line. You want him signing it, like, having a good understanding of what those terms mean, um, so that it's not a deal breaker when he realizes, like, what, what, what I'm supposed to leave invoices.

And I thought I get paid for all of those. Like, those are the things that can end up, like, killing a deal. So I think it's more of like, you know, You know, the educational sales process, right? It's like, okay, so I want to talk through a couple terms. Make sure we're on the same page there. Here's why they're important.

Here's why I need to include them. And what do you think about this? And how about this? And how about this? Okay, so. With all of that being said, then how, how do you feel about 2.5? And if he's like, well, well, well, and then that's where you can start going back and forth on that negotiation, knowing that your top end, even at 2.

9 or 3, you're still looking pretty good. And once you get under the hood of it, and like, okay, he was under, he didn't have enough insurance, you know, or. The, the ad backs weren't what they said they were. Then you can have a retrade conversation and diligence, you know, and you have the report to back it up and and you can make sense.

But, um, I think you have the opportunity to start low here. And if if that doesn't feel like, uh, yeah, I'm ready to sign. Let's go through the process. Then then you have some things in your back pocket. Or like the, um, the, uh, amount of time to get paid back on the seller note. That is another thing in your back pocket where you can be like, well, you know, we could actually structure it.

So you could get made whole in 5 years. If you don't want to wait 10, how old is this gentleman? Is he wanting to retire?

[00:31:00]
Joe: Early 60s.

Athena: Okay. So, yeah, so he might, I mean, he's still young.

Joe: Right. Depending on how he feels

Athena: about his, his health and everything, he might not want to wait 10 years.

Joe: Right. I, I think I get the feeling because of the, he's not rushing and open to a longer transition.

To me, that just kind of screams of he'd probably be. He'd probably see the benefit of a longer note. Great. That's just me. Right. Don't don't know until I get into that. That could be a deal. 1

Athena: thing you have to be careful on that you touched on earlier was incentivizing him for performance. Um, so SBA doesn't like that very much, but there are ways

Joe: what if he's, what if he's carried on as an employee,

Athena: um,

Joe: do they look into that?

Athena: Yeah, so you can do a consulting agreement, but I think it's the actual incentivization around numbers like profit. Unless there you do a rollover where they maintain equity, and then they get distributions and are incentivized that way, right? Like it's a, if you do a partial buyout,

[00:32:00]
you need to be careful around how you, uh, incentivize them after sale, because then it can appear as an earn out, which SBA doesn't like,

Anca: right?

Athena: So, where we can incentivize them around hitting sales targets. It's like, when, when they had a down year, and we're trying to get them back to a year that they had before SBA is like, okay, that's that's.

Just getting them back to something they've already achieved when it's hitting new targets that they've never achieved before. Then it looks and smells like an earn out, but you can do things like, add a consulting fee and stuff like that. And obviously, like, change the parameters of that after, but at least as far as the deal structure itself and the terms, the SBA is going to be all over the purchase agreement.

Like, what are the terms of all of these things and that sort of thing. So, um, yeah, Um, but the, um, legal team and SBA folks will be able to tell you when you go through it, like what, what they're cool with and what they're not. Okay, so I think you have a really great opportunity here. So now it's just about getting him bought in to the terms of the deal and moving forward with exclusivity and him grasping what all of that means.

And before you get, before you get an offer inked with him, I think it's, it's just determining if there is working capital or not, because if it does turn out that all of his clients wait to pay him 60 days, then then that's a huge swing on this number.

[00:33:00]
Joe: Oh, yeah, I agree. I guess things were only assumed, but like I said, we didn't get into, uh, financials or numbers nitty gritty yet. It's more of a meet and greet intro. Keep things, um, light and get them to like me.

Athena: I love that. And, and it's a, it's a light question, right? Like, hey, how do you get paid? You know, like, instead of like, what are your working capital requirements?

So like, what, what, what? Like, hey, how do you, like, how does the process work? Like, talk me through like, uh, Just a job. What does it look like? Somebody gets in touch and then somebody goes out and like, how do they pay? And so you can keep it light and friendly like that to just like, fill me in and give me a picture of what that might look like.

But then it gives you that Intel of, oh, they do have payment terms or they're not getting paid right away or whatever. Um, and I would get that cleared off first. Um, and maybe have some chats with him about, hey, do you understand, like, the process and what happens next? Um, how are you feeling about all that?

Do we know he I know he's in a rush, but do we know he definitely wants to sell? Like, are we feeling good about his reason

[00:35:00]
Ryan: feel? Um, my, my feeling is he, when he says something and carries meaning, um, and he seems to me, he's like, look, what I kind of voiced my concerns about him going back on the price. He was like, look, I'm serious about this.

So I feel good about it.

Athena: Awesome. This is exciting. This sounds like a really great deal. And Joe, from what Ryan was explaining, y'all have a really nice personality match too.

Anca: Yeah, maybe, hopefully.

Ryan: I think Joe did a good job. I said the guy's a bit tough. Um, you know, Joe has some experience in sales and dealing with people, and I think he handled them well on the call.

Athena: Yeah, cool. Yeah. So I think that's the biggest thing is like, don't blindside him. Yeah. With the offer, you want to have all that in a discussion ideally in person, like, Joe, if you can meet him in person and talk through these aspects, like, it just softens. And makes it a lot more of, like, a collaborative thing, rather than going back and forth on email or zoom calls.

It is a little bit more investment of your time, but I know that it's, it's worked wonders for other clients when they have negotiation points, like, when you go in person and you're like, okay, so. You know, I just want to talk through some things to make sure you understand it. And, like, you're feeling comfortable with these concepts because I know we don't have somebody involved.

So I just want us to be on the same page. And then what I'm going to do is I'm going to send a big, scary legal document over to, but I want, I don't want there to be any surprises in there, you know, so, you know, everything that's coming your way. So let's talk about that 1st. Um, before before I send that over, and then once I send that over, that's basically going to be a commitment for us to be exclusive while we go through the next stage.

And I want to make sure that you feel comfortable and you're bought into everything because there's, it's, it's going to be a lot of scrutiny. So it's, it's going to be a lot for you. And also, I'm going to end up incurring a lot of expenses to go through this process to validate everything in order to buy your business.

So before we get there, I just want to make sure you feel good.

[00:37:00]
Joe: Right? Yep. Sounds good. I will find out some more of those things. Like you said, I guess I'm probably assuming too many things on the working capital piece, but, uh, get some detail around that

Athena: at a very basic because it'll determine that in the, in the QoE,

Joe: right?

Athena: Um, and the, you know, the bank will have an idea of how much they want in there too. So, but at a very basic level to just understand, like, how long it takes them to get paid. On average, you know, and he'll know that, um, because he manages what what owners don't do is they don't do all these forecasts, but they, they manage their bank account.

They know what they need in the bank to pay all their bills every month. And, you know, that sort of thing. So that they typically know how long it takes them to get paid and what the process looks like. So, if there's chasing of invoices or payment terms extended, or that sort of thing. You know, knowing that up front will save you because I had a, um, a business that Chris and I worked on.

And we originally, uh, when we started, um, working on the deal, the working capital requirements for like 400,000, but they implemented some stuff and they started growing, like, they used the EOS system and implemented it, and so the business just started taking off. Well, as a result of that, the working capital requirements doubled.

[00:39:00]
Right? So it had not included working capital in the deal. They would have had to, like, include an extra 400 somewhere and increase their purchase price by that much because because of that. So.

Good to get that covered up, covered off up front.

Awesome. How are you feeling? Any other questions? Any other ways we can help you with this one?

Joe: Um, no, I don't think so. Uh, it's, it's obviously a little bit of a different approach and kind of a weird sequence of how it's turning out, but, uh, maybe to be expected. And, uh, part of it was also, I had a, an early perception of a fantastic deal, right?

And clearly I think it's a matter of, um, a seller who's thought about it more now that he's getting serious, he's either doing a research and, or he talked with someone to find out maybe what the closer value to his business is. Um, and, you know, what we're the 1st person we think that he's he's talking with.

So it's a little bit of a learning experience for him on his own. And can't fault him for that.

Athena: No, absolutely. The same thing in his in his in his situation. You'd start doing some research and chatting with folks too. So,

Steve: right.

[00:40:00]
Athena: Excellent. Very exciting. Um, cool. Uh, anyone else have anything to add on top of that 1 or questions or.

Thoughts as Joe marches forward on a cool off market opportunity.

Chris: I'll, I'll probably bring mine next week or Tuesday. Right. So, um, but we'll see, I need to meet the seller first, but, um, once I do the, the first pass at the modeling, maybe we can, we can talk strategy. Can you, while we're here, cause this will be, I know the concept. And I know it might've been talked, um, the, the new SBA rule on rollover equity, but would you, could you maybe help, um, to share some light on that?

I know, so basically this deal that Luke and Ryan have brought me is a roofing company, just how I like, like sort of the rules that I, I, I like, it's like, well established like 20 years in business, um, has some big business, there's like 20 employees or more. Um, it has all the right things that I like, a really good number, like top line and healthy, um, operating income or profit.

Um, so the numbers I think will make sense what, um, I have never done. So this will be a 1st is structuring. Um, he, he's open to, or he would like to retain anywhere from 10 to 20 percent equity in the business. Um, I suspect once I meet him, I'll gather this intel, but I suspect is because he really wants to be part of the growth before he was really looking for P for P firm to buy it.

He knows it's the right time. It's in Florida, southern Florida. So there's a lot of. Movement in the area. Um, so with that in mind, or the context, would you, like, structurally, how does, how, how do we model that? Or how does that go in? Would you share a little bit of light on that?

[00:42:00]
Athena: Yeah, sure. Um, so Luke did a really great update.

Uh, was it last Tuesday? Yeah, so, um,

Chris: well,

Athena: no, so that that will give you the overall, like, idea, but in a nutshell, basically, um, SBA has loosened their guidelines to allow asset sales to also do rollover equity before if you were doing rollover and using SBA, they forced you to do a stock sale. So, um, 1 of the team will send you the link to that call.

So you can watch Luke's update there because he goes a little bit more in depth. In terms of your deal,

when you're doing a, so you would value the business the same way, but then the purchase price would be a percentage of, of whatever equity that you're taking off the table. So let's say, okay, I valued this. I think it's worth 3 million and he wants to retain 20 percent of that. So I would offer 80 percent of that.

001 for 80 percent of the business. I, I make no, so this is a personal preference. You have to like gauge yourself. I love partnerships where you don't have an existing relationship.

[00:44:00]
Um, because you don't know if you will be on the same page. About how you work together about the direction of the business, et cetera, et cetera. So, um, that's why I'm openly disclosing. Like, I am not a fan of giving people equity in your business unless you absolutely have to and or they're absolute unicorns that you can't find anywhere else. And it makes sense for you to do. So so while you're meeting this person, you really got to, like, And I think that's a really great point.

It's so important to really, really deeply understand if this is a person that you think is going to be an amazing partner to you for the foreseeable. Luke also shared an episode, which will get you the link to that too, on Acquiring Minds of somebody that like, left equity in the business. Um, on a plumbing business with somebody, and they just like, ruined the business and he was filing bankruptcy and all sorts of crazy stuff.

So, obviously, you don't want to give majority ownership, but it's not a bad thing. If an owner is like, wanting to stay in and they're just like, overwhelmed with with what it takes to grow it to the next level. They want new energy. They want some chips off the table. They want to be in more of a consultative role.

You know,

[00:45:00]
so, um, I looked at, uh, you know, my, my property management business, like, had I been able, SBA didn't allow it at the time, which was super frustrating. And they changed the SOP after that deal. But, you know, the winning deal offered them 20 percent roll over equity. And I would have happily done that because I would have loved to work with them.

Like, I just thought they were fantastic. And they were just like, yeah, that's what I wanted to do. We want to be able to go and travel with our kids like we know where this business can go, but we're not we're not up for that. But we want to stay involved, you know, um, so I would say, like, really evaluate him and how your relationship would look like.

And you want to ask some of those prenup questions, right? Like, well, to gauge if you have the same mentality about vision, about work ethic, about customer service, right? So, there's other ways that you can, um, incentivize them, you know, without equity, potentially, depending on the numbers. Like, is there a performance note in there?

Can we do a consulting fee for them? Like, we keep them involved in some way, um,

[00:46:00]
but there's a number where they would be, they would be happy to, like, walk, you know, so I think it's a very deeply personal and specific to every single deal. Like, do you think you could work with that person and, and, you know, have his face still there? Cause I also know that, um, folks that buy businesses and the owner sticks around, it's really hard for them to establish their own culture and stamp and direction because the team and the clients and everyone's still treat the owner as the owner.

Chris: Yeah, no, you're hitting definitely a few things that I, that I want to gauge and, um, just that's how the deal has been presented, right? I need to know him and see if it's truly, I don't know, has someone coached him and he's just heard a lot of like peers that have basically sold to PE shops and cause just that, that even the concept of him, like, yeah, I want to retain equity.

It's like, oh, look at you. You're like, you know, it's interesting because normally like I would expect him just wanting to sell And then listening to some of the broker calls that Luke had It seems exactly that he's like he's he he wants a PE shop to buy him, but he's open to like an individual So we'll see I uh I just got a response today, so I'll coordinate that and see if he passes what I call my wine test.

See if I can actually go, you know, like a glass of wine with him and and have a few questions written down and see how it goes.

[00:48:00]
Athena: You can also structure it so he doesn't have equity for the foreseeable. Right? So, like, it's over the next couple of years and then you clock back and you earn it over time.

I'm sorry, I'm forgetting the term, but it's like, the opposite of vesting. Right? So, like, you earn more back from him over time, or you have the buyback options from him to, like, buy that equity off of him at some point. So you can. You know, with the right advisory. Legally, I'm like, how to structure something like that.

You can also structure something like that where he doesn't just own it for the foreseeable. There's a way for you to get it back over time.

Chris: Yeah. Yeah. I, uh, yes, I know that structure that I have a personal deal on something else that has that, like, 357 and that's exactly how they, like, they can buy me out in those, those, those years.

Athena: Right, um, and then, but what is cool about the, the changes is that you can, you can do an asset sale and do rollover equity, which helps you significantly on, you know, the, the tax side of things for yourself and, like, what the free cash flow is to you. So there was restrictions before where, like, if you were going to do rollover equity of any kind, it had to be a stock sale, which kind of screws you over.

[00:49:00]
You know, in terms of, like, your tax situation, assumed liability, and all of that. So, um, on the, um, yeah, so Luke talks through that. If you didn't already watch the LOI, uh, and legal discussion with Barlow Williams, and they talk about stock asset sale, that sort of thing. Uh, Luke also has the episode that I think was shared in the buyer's channel, but we'll make sure we get an overdue about, you know, just like it was a worst case scenario situation of a dude that got fully screwed over by somebody that gave equity, but, you know, would rather you walk in eyes wide open of like, what worst case scenario could be.

But again, like I said, it's, it's, if you love the business and you're like, my gosh, this owner. So we actually had a client early last year. Who found a business where there was like two owners and one of them was essentially like the operator and he wasn't ready to like hang up, but he was a minority owner.

So he was like, I just want to stay in and keep working. And, and it was a great scenario for the buyer because he had a operator built in via the owner. You know, so a scenario like that, it's not necessarily a bad thing to have an incentivized operator. That's like, I don't want to deal with the strategy, the business and the finances and the payroll and all this stuff.

I just want to do what I'm good at, which, in this case might be roofing, you know, like, I just want to go out to jobs and make sure the guys are doing what they need to do there. Um, so you also got to find out what the reasoning is, you know, and like, why he wants to stay involved and it might actually be to your benefit to have somebody.

Like that

[00:51:00]
Chris: solely based on the broker call. I suspect that it may be along those lines. But again, that wasn't me. That was Luke having that conversation and that's a broker that wasn't the actual seller. So I'm still too early to. To call it, but basically it was described, um, to us or to Luke and I've listened in, but as he wants someone to grow the business, he sees the potential and he doesn't want to deal with that.

And he wants to make sure that the guys on the ground actually get to do the roofing, you know,

sounds so the potential seems to be there. And now it's a matter of, like. You know, is it true? Can we make it work? And to your point, like, yeah, I want to have control. It's like, this is a lot, right? So it can, can we make it an instructor? But, um,

Athena: yeah,

Chris: still early, early phase.

[00:52:00]
Athena: After you meet him, if you like him, then we can talk about strategy for how to test his openness to being coached or being suggested in different directions.

Right? Like. Um, so there's there's things that you can do to kind of, like, as you're getting to know him, but you're can test his kind of mindset and openness to changes, or if he's just going to, like, want to continue as is, and he just wants to take some chips off the table. But that's a typical structure with, like, private equity is they want.

They make offers to owners, they make them leave equity in the business and keep them working in the business for a couple of years so they can grow it. And then they, that, that equity that the owners left in is worth even more after they were involved with growing it. So that's a kind of sell from private equity.

So he might have heard that structure and he really liked it, you know, so. But we can always present other options to that. He might just not have thought of before. Similarly, like, we're all, we're all learning creative structures for how to package a deal. He maybe hasn't heard all the options, particularly with, um.

Uh, like, a buyer, like yourself, who's an individual versus private equity. So

I'll get questions. I'm excited to hear how it goes.

Steve: I have a question.

Athena: Yeah, sure. You good. Chris, does that help answer your question? It's

[00:54:00]
Steve: actually, it's actually about Chris's. It's about Chris's, uh, situation. So. Awesome. Chris, have you ever, I know, I know you mentioned you don't really love, you know, personally on a personal level, having a partner per se in there.

How about, and I know there's more complexity in the structure. Have you ever seen it done where you offered. As a limited partner together, a limited partnership where they can participate, but they have no, uh, say in, I know there's a little bit more complexity. So that you

Chris: read that correctly. I maybe I, um, I don't know if it came across in a way, but it's like, it's not that I'm not open to partnerships, but I am very self aware.

So my disk profile, how I conduct myself like this being, you know, there's a lot of personal risk. There's a lot of personal capital that I'll be putting down. Okay. So it's like, I want to make sure that I have enough control, but to your point, yeah, no, I, I, I actually welcome, so, so yes, to your point, having that, that, that could be something, I'm open to that, and again, this is all speculation, hence why it's like, I, I, I'm sort of teasing you guys and selfishly asking so that I can strategize for the call.

But, um, but what I hope it is, is some sort of like, what Athena has mentioned, like, he's heard the structure from either peers or because it's hot in Florida and especially in this area, all the, all the New York and the California people from the funds moving down there and then having a lot of buying everything out.

[00:55:00]
Um, I gather he, you know, he comes from a family of roofers, second or third generation. So I guess he just wants to know that in the future he can make more money. What I know is that, you know, this is like dating, it will be like a 10 to 15 year commitment. So I just want to make sure that, you know, there's a lot of things, right?

But to your point, yes, I'm open, I'm open to that. Um, actually it works pretty neatly because he, that license takes, Like four months, three to work from three to four months to get, and he has a lot of like specialty licensees as well. So having someone like him with the reputation and like in the business is, would be great.

Like I I'm open to it just has to be in the right, you know, cause, uh, because of the downside, like what Athena was mentioning, like, and also seeing like, well, are people really gonna. You know, me being I don't know how old this gentleman is, but I'm going to assume he's going to be older than me. So, like, like a younger guy or like mid middle aged guy coming in and he may be being all there's like, you know, there could be a lot of factors that I just, you know, I need to be a realistic consider and sort of account for them as I go into the transaction.

[00:56:00]
Athena: Awesome. Cool. We're, we're running on time, but just to pick up on a few points there. I would question why you'd need a limited partner if you can do the deal by yourself financially. So, typically, you're bringing in a limited partner because you can't get the deal done. So, putting an owner is a limited partner.

I would say, like, how is that? How is that helping you? Right? So, like, under under what circumstances would that help you for something like licenses, though? That is. You know, and there are requirements with certain types of businesses in certain states where 1 of the owners passed to have a license. So, then you would leave them with some equity in order to make that happen.

So, another thing to think about for all of you, if you're considering rollover equity. Something that's not clear with the changes, but I know anything over 20 percent ownership would put them on the requirements to most owners aren't going to want more than 20 percent because they don't want to put a personal guarantee on your loan to buy their business.

So that's another thing to think about with the percentages. But, um.

[00:57:00]
Great questions. Good combo. Um, okay. So Thursday we've got Susie who is going to come and she's going to teach you about ROBS, which is, uh, using your retirement accounts without a taxable event to either invest into your business and or to make your post closed liquidity better for the banks.

She's going to be breaking down what that all looks like, what the requirements are, what the costs are. So, do you understand if that's another tool that you can have in your financial toolkit? So, if you have any retirement accounts over 50,000 might be worth you jumping into that call on Thursday. So you could learn about how that all works.

Um, then the following Thursday, we're going to have 2 time SMB acquire Mike who's done garage floor. Business and a towing business. Who's super active in the search or community. He's going to come on and talk you through what he wish he knew, uh, when he was acquiring a business and some cool stuff that he's learned that actually like alleviate some of the fears that you have going into it.

[00:58:00]
Um, particularly around like when you have a liquidity crunch or when, when, you know, you're, you're in a crunch on the numbers a month managing the business. So he's going to be coming next Thursday. Then the following Thursday, we're going to have insurance due diligence conversation. So this 1 doesn't sound like that big of a deal, but can have a huge impact on retrain during due diligence.

So, we're going to be having Andy, who specializes in insurance due diligence. They do your due diligence. Free, um, as part of your due diligence process, they look at all the insurance policies and they tell you where there's problems, where there might be like workman's comp claims or where they were, um, not having enough coverage.

And then sometimes it ends up being an adjustment to the STE as a result of that process. So he's gonna be talking you through insurance, why you need it, what you need to be thinking about as you go through the diligence process. Uh, and what that can actually mean for you if you decide to do some insurance due diligence, which to me, it's like, it's free of cost.

So like to have another pair of eyes looking at things that none of us are probably experts on in terms of workman's comp and what kind of coverage that we need is pretty awesome. So that's the lineup for the expert calls on Thursdays. And then Tuesdays we're going to keep open. So if you have these deals, if you have the models, You know, Ryan and the team are always available to you, but I'm, I'm going to be on the Tuesday calls.

[00:59:00]
And if you just want to chat about it with each other, we can bring those things on the Tuesday call. So super excited. I'm loving these. Keep bringing your stuff. Keep keep, uh, you know, making offers and making strides. We're so excited. We feel like there's a lot of really great movement already happening this year.

Um, so thank you so much. We'll see you next Thursday for Susie, who's going to talk about ROBS.

Gil: Thank you.

[01:00:00]
Athena: Thanks, y'all. Have a good day.

Joe: All right. Thanks, guys.
