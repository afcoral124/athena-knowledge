Athena: Um, so before I, I ask you guys specifically about any progress on the stuff you're working on, I wanted to chat through, um, just takeaways or anything that, that resonated with you from our conversation with Matt and private, private debt, private capital last week.

Justin: Yeah. I mean, you know, I, I don't know if it was an epiphany, you know, or something more enlightening than it was great to hear perspective outside of kind of the standard SBA channels, you know, it's, uh, especially, and, and I speak from, from the experience of navigating something that is interesting that is not SBA qualified or wouldn't be. Um, it was good to hear some perspective and just the thought, the thoughts. Find somebody who sees and entertains, you know, opportunities that may not be as cookie cutter as, as we all hope they would be. Um, as a matter of fact, I called him and, and we had a good chat. Um, and he's, I don't know if this is, this opportunity is for Stonehenge specifically, but he goes, you know what, I've got a couple people in mind. Let me like, make some calls and see if I can't find, you know, this might sit really well with some people I know in, in their wheelhouse. So he's gonna reach back out. We're gonna reconnect, uh, early next week.

Athena: Amazing. Oh, that's so cool. Yeah. Um. You know, giving like deal flow amongst like private folks is like, you know, passing along on deals or connecting you with people. So would love to, um, hear who he recommends and if they also see, 'cause what I love about him is like, integrity values. It just like, it's, there's very, there's a lot of heart in. Yeah, what him and Stonehenge offer, which is different from like how you view like most investment funds, you know?

Justin: Yeah. Agreed. Yeah, that's, I, I particularly liked that about, you know, him and, and what he seems to stand for. So I was, uh, yeah, I'm real interested to see, you know, his thoughts on, you know, who he might have in mind for this. And, uh, so he just said, yeah, standby, I'll, I'll find more out and then we'll be in touch. So, uh, yeah, I'll, I'll let you guys know kind of what he says or who he might bring to the table.

Athena: Fantastic. Um, and then Steve, how did that conversation land for you? Any, any thoughts, epiphanies, takeaways?

Steve: Yeah, so I listened to most of it. I was kind of walking through an airport at the time, so I didn't, wasn't in view mode, I was mostly in listen mode. Uh, but I think the biggest takeaway I got out of it or like the mind opening thing, 'cause I think, you know, we've spoken about trying to up level a little bit the size of the deals. And then when you get to that, then it's like, how much are you comfortable handling yourself versus bringing in another investor? And what I heard, and if I heard it correctly, it sounds like they're actually willing if, for the right deal, even to take maybe that second equity stake in it as well. So now, instead of having to go and get, grab some folks, uh, and say, Hey, you wanna take an equity stake? Oh, by, by the way, the SBA wants you to be on the hook for the whole loan. Uh, these guys are already on the hook for the whole loan. They're loaning it. So it seems to me that it's, when you start looking at that, it might be a little more pricey, but the other side of it is it might, uh, be a much smoother transaction with, with actually less people, less, um, I guess you're answering to people who are sophisticated enough to understand what's going on as an investor instead of trying to explain to somebody who it's like brand new to, so,

Athena: Right. Yeah. I, I guess that's the, that's the trade off with friends and family, right? Is they don't necess, they're not sophisticated investors. Um, actually I just, I just, I'm gonna have my friend. And, and. Former investor on my round Darius, he's out all summer, like at the end of the summer, come and talk. But like one of the things he talked about when he sc schooled me on my investment round was dumb money versus smart money. And he is like, not calling these people dumb, but in terms of the money that you're getting, there's dumb money, there's smart money, you know, and dumb money is like friends and family that believe in what you're doing, but are not sophisticated investors by any means. So. They don't understand the K-1 reporting that they're gonna have to do. They don't understand how returns work or what craft means or any of these terms, as opposed to smart money, where it's like all they do is invest, right? And they're gonna know way more than you. And so you know that, that difference of who you're talking to. Um, but there are trade offs with everything, right? So it's like, okay, you might not be having to take a personal guarantee. But you might have to give away some equity. You might have to pay a higher interest rate. You will have some form of governance where you're gonna have to monthly provide financial statements and quarterly have board meetings, right? Under certain circumstances, especially when you're going after larger deals. To me, that might also be a benefit because it creates accountability. That you're having to like, make sure your finances are, like you're on top of, your finances are on a monthly basis, and having somebody to be a thought partner to talk through things on a quarterly basis on how the business is going. I, I don't, you know, especially if they're taking a small equity stake. Then that, that might be a good thing in some instances where you're not, they don't, you don't have to follow their direction necessarily, but you have a, somebody that's you know, literally invested in you, you doing well, and the business doing well.

Steve: Also sets you up for a sale down the road. You don't have to, you, you, your, your books are gonna look just like that. Next set of investors are ready for it instead of you scrambling and trying to figure it all out at that point. I mean, it's a good best practice to do anyway. But like you said to, I look at it as, as well, you mentioned that your friends', family, folks, you know. Uh, they're rooting for you and this and that. They may not be super qualified to call you out on, you know, is this a good deal? If I'm thinking, if they're willing to take an equity stake, not just from a, you know, there now that you as a lender, you're first in line as equity, you're behind that in line. So there is additional risks on their part. Yeah.

Justin: I, I, I mean, to your point, Athea, I liked the fact that there's, uh, I think a greater access to consultation with, with something like this. I, I absolutely think that that's a benefit because, I mean, you know, I guess I'll speak for myself, but having a board, or at least, you know, uh, one or two key advisors who might be a part of a, a kind of a lending team like this with experience, I mean, that's invaluable, especially for first time. You know, business buyer like myself or something like, you know what I mean? It's so like, so I see that as a value add, not a deterrent. If anything, I, I would prefer and welcome that because it's just access to more resources. And you know, Steve said something interesting around setting herself up for a sale, not only just by being held accountable to good, you know, financials, clean books, and making sure everything's run productively. But I was talking about this with my wife and she said, you know, I was talking about, you know, this. This coworking space that isn't SBA qualified, but you know, might be suitable for an alternative investment potential because the, you know, if the revenue's good and, and cashflow is good and everything else, you know, pencils. And she goes, well, wouldn't you run into an issue then if you try to sell? 'cause it's still not gonna be SBA qualified on the backside. I go, yeah, but I'll, I'm gonna have something that. I, you know, I'm gonna create as a value add along the way, and that's a lender who's already in place and willing to lend on it because they lent it to me, right? So if somebody comes to look to buy this business five, seven years, whatever, if I, if I'm in a position to sell, I can say, Hey, don't, I'm not gonna have the same problem I had running into this thing with a big question mark, because I can put you right in touch with the person who you should talk to, because that's how I got the business, right? So, um, if anything, I think that's another edge.

Athena: Have you ever read—

Steve: Sorry—Justin, have you ever read The EXITPreneur’s Playbook?

Justin: I haven't, no.

Steve: Uh, so it's a book written by, I believe it was the founder of Quiet Light. And Quiet Light does like brokering businesses, but basically the whole concept is really building, you know, when you take over businesses, building the systems, so now you, you've got systems in place when you sell it. Not only is it, uh, more saleable and easier, like you said, for somebody to come in and, and, and vet it out. But also adds more value because you have the systems in place. Yep. Starting that from the beginning with that, it was an interesting read. I remember. Um, you know, just, just the concept. If nothing else, just the thought process instead of, you know, we buy a business, we jump in there like it's getting the business going. There's you, like, not even then, then it's, then it's, that's everything's a mess a year into it. And then you gotta kind of, it's harder to unwind the mess instead of going right away. So.

Justin: Yeah, there's a, there's a podcast literally called Built to Sell. I don't know if anybody's heard of that one, but it's all around talking to sellers, and so it's, you know, the, you've got the, the Acquiring Minds, which is the buy side, like everybody's searching. Well then this is talking with sellers, positioning their businesses to sell or who have sold. To your point, I love it because I, I, I'm, it's like a cheat code to the other side, right? You get to see like exactly what goes through the minds of sellers, how they should best position, you know, an exit. And, and I'm obsessed with it. I think it's incredibly valuable. Um, so I've been digging through, I mean, for months now. I've been digging through a bunch of those episodes, but it's on my regular hit list. Um, but I agree. I mean, I, you know, I'm going into this acquisition, whatever it may be, you know, day one thinking. Okay. How do I position for an exit? Not necessarily because I have to, but in case I want to, or, you know, how do I structure this, you know, from an, uh, operation perspective to think, exit mind and just polish, polish every step of the way, um, just to create that value and have a, ideally a better exit.

Athena: It's, it's also good business practice, right? Like so. Building this business and thinking about all the risk areas, because that's really what, what your business is valued on is like risk, right? Like where's the risk? So how can you mitigate risk, key man risk or data risk? Bad books risk. You know, it's like if your books are bad, you're probably not running your business finance in a financially sound way. If you're doing everything, then you're probably crippling growth and or making a business completely reliant on you like. Um, those sorts of like not having SOPs. If, if your key ops manager like gets sick, then how do you run your business, you know? So it's, I think it's a, just a solid, like preparing for exit, whether you exit or not, just constantly. It's a good way of like running a business. Um, I did, I knew about the book Built to Sell. I didn't know they did a podcast. So that's something,

Justin: It's awesome. Yeah. I mean, they've got tons of episodes, so Yeah. Yeah,

Athena: Luke's, Luke's listening in, but I'm sure he is gonna want dig into that too. He is been enjoying, uh. Looking at things from all angles, including how brokers do things and stuff. So, um, so I know, you know, both of you, uh, a reason for wanting to buy a business is to have that autonomy and control may be a little reticent to have investors in the mix because of that. So how did the conversation with Matt shift that thinking, if at all? Like, how are you feeling about potentially. You know, doing this a hundred percent yourself with SBA, you get, you know, total control of it versus potentially looking at private capital for larger deals. And maybe having somebody that's not only, you know, providing debt, but maybe gonna want to piece it to equity pie too.

Justin: I mean, uh, I don't know, Steve, if you have thoughts, I don't want to Bogart, you know, all of the response, but go, go for it. If you've got something.

Steve: I mean, I look at it, uh, is deal dependent. So money is money and if it makes more sense, if it's something that you feel better about controlling everything. And, and quite frankly, there's a, there's a number in my head I'm willing to write a check for, to get in. And if we're out of that league, uh, bringing in an investor's, you know, is, is the next best, uh, thing to do. You're going to give up equity, whether you give it up to friends and family, and quite frankly. You know, in this type of situation, I'd, I'd have to dig deeper into it, but the friends and family thing, there's a line right there too, uh, on a personal level that, um, if they're not sophisticated enough, I don't, I don't, it's not worth blowing friends and family over a business deal. So I'd rather have the more impersonal. Uh, smarter money, I'll call it that, that can actually add value, by the way too, because I have some good input and I think that's more interesting to me than friends. And it might be easier for, with friends and family not have to answer as many tough questions, but I think the, the other side of it is. You kinda want the tough questions because if you're gonna give up equity, you, I, I look at it, you think about like a VC fund, right? A lot of times they'll put a VC fund, there'll be 30 different companies in it, and you know, and, and then, then they start cross-selling to each other within the fund. You know, each one uses each other's services. They kind of lift each other up. It's kinda like you, you now have somebody in your court that may an issue comes up, Hey, we have this other portfolio here, or this other group we're working with you guys could be a synergy. We can make the introduction. I. So I, I don't, I'm not negative on it at all. Quite frankly, if the deal is something we could handle on our own, I would want the partnership. Yeah. Uh, you know, but it does open up a whole next level because I do struggle with the idea. Okay, now you, you know, you have to really. You, you're already putting the presentation in front of them. It's like you're presenting to a VC in this case, but it's a lender. Uh, but with the same idea, they're seeing the package up front, whereas somebody else, you know, you've gotta create an investor's package and you gotta run through that. So to me that's, it's a much more complex. But, you know, and I'll, I'll yield to you, Justin, but if I look at it, yes. If we can do the deal ourselves and it makes sense, I'm in, if, if we need to bring in an investor. Uh, I just like, I like the professionalism and the, in personalization. There's probably some negative I haven't seen or thought of yet behind that, but some Gotcha. But, you know, aside from that, that's how I think about it.

Justin: Yeah, I, I, I, I pretty much agree lockstep. I mean it, you know, it's, if it's small enough that I can take it down individually, then that's probably what I'll do or what I would prefer to do, just because, you know, simplicity sake, if it large enough. That it necessitates outside capital, then I'm open to it. And like Steve said, being kind of deal dependent, to me, it's also investor by investor dependent. Like I'm evaluating each investor and they're not all created equal. I mean, there's a reason, the reason SEC has like an accreditation, right? For investors like they, it's. It's two ways. It's to prevent people who don't know what they're doing from losing their shirts, and it's also, you know, an indirect benefit to the person raising the capital. It's a savings, ideally a savings of headaches in trying to. Capitulate to people who don't know what they're talking about in the first place. And so friends and family, while they may mean well and would want to help and give money and all that stuff, it's, it's a harder conversation in many ways to talk through what you're trying to accomplish with somebody who doesn't know what they're doing to begin with, but. Has thrown money in the pot, right? So, uh, it's almost easier to do it with, like Steve said, like professionals, people who, this is what they do, they know what they're doing. It's impersonal, but there is value add, especially if they have experience, you know, like the Stonehenge and Matts of the world or, or that kind of thing where, you know, there's, there's perspective, there's additional resource that you can leverage for this thing. Um, and mention the fact scaling. I, I, I'm reminded yet again. I think Will had on Acquiring Minds, one of his recent guests, the last one or two, I can't remember, but it's a recent one where he said something really interesting that was a. I forget sometimes. And he said, look, he, he was one of those proponents like going bigger isn't, is actually inherently safer, right? Because of the scale. What, how you can scale, put the purpose, you know, profit lines to create like barriers that, that and modes to protect yourself. Hiring the, like more people, you know, it's infrastructure, right? But he goes, look, think about it like this. If you're getting, and he was thinking through the lens specifically of SBA, but he goes, if you're going SBA and you've got a PG on the line, he goes, your downside, no matter the size of what you're buying is bankruptcy. So you've got a floor. The floor is always bankruptcy. He goes, doesn't matter. Exponentially in your favor, or should be at least structurally when you've got a larger, you know, business that you're buying. Because if you're gonna buy something, buy for the upside, buy for the infrastructure, buy for the, the means that you can afford or stretch to afford, but it's actually safer play. 'cause in either way, you lose, you're bankrupt. He goes, so, you know, and I was like, that's really interesting. He goes, so it's a, it's a, it's a favorable in our, in our side on the buy side, the searchers, it's, it's. A, uh, it's in favor. The, the momentum is in favor from an XY axi, the bigger you get. 'cause the downside remains stagnant, right? It's level, but you've got more upside when you go bigger. That was his, his thesis, and it was really cool. Like, you're right. It's like no matter how, if it's the million dollars and I can't pay the bill, it's 10 million and I can't pay the bill. It's bankruptcy either way.

Steve: When you, when you're broke, you're broke.

Justin: Yeah, exactly.

Athena: That's, uh, I, I like that. I'm gonna, I'm gonna use that at necessary times too. 'cause I, I, I, you know, I make a secret that I think larger, larger ones with more, you know, um, infrastructure and stuff are more stable. So, to that effect though, with, with like, uh, private. Credit, private debt, private lenders. There's, there's no PG but maybe more of a, an interest rate potentially that, that you're paying there does that. And, and sometimes they don't take equity if they don't need to. So, um, I thought that was the most interesting thing about these is like, you can put something in meaningful to you, right? You're still putting in your equity check. Whatever you can do. They're evaluating you, the buyer, and whether they wanna back you and also the business. You might play a point or two higher on the percentage rate potentially, but you're not on the hook for bankruptcy. So how did that sound as an option or, I mean,

Justin: sign me up if it pencil an extra point or two pencils safely, DSCR in place. Like, and fundamentally it doesn't change. Like, that's not the, the, the lever that changes the, uh, safety of the transaction. And the only trade off, or the trade off for a point or two is no PG. Like to me, that is, I'll buy that all day. Like, but that's, that. I mean, speak for myself, but that is properly. I will take that deal. Um. It's, again, it's risk mitigation, right? Everything we're doing is mitigating against risk. There's nothing I see risk here. I've got two young kids, I've got a family, I've got, you know, a lot of, hopefully working years ahead of me where I need to provide. And so, you know, anything I can do to. To prevent the cataclysmic downside, which that would be the worst case, nightmare scenario, is bankruptcy and losing every, you know, and I can safeguard against that. All I gotta do is pay a couple extra points and if it pencils anyway, then we're good. Yeah. All day. Like that's not even, I don't even have to overthink that.

Steve: So I must have been going through security when they brought that up. 'cause I missed that. 'cause that would've changed my first answer, uh, to exactly what Justin just said. Uh, you know, at the end of the day it the nu if, if you are, if, if the numbers aren't gonna work with the higher, you know, a couple extra points on there. If you really need that to make it work. 'cause you're cutting it that thin, your risk is actually higher to begin with. Mm-hmm. And, and add and, and you give up the personal guarantee. 'cause you know, Justin, you got young kids, you still have you, you can still recover at. My age, I don't have the 20 years to recover when I blow it up. So I have to be a little bit more careful about that component. So I think that even makes it even more interesting. And it is just, it's just finding the right deal. That pencils is the, the key and the way I see it. But

Athena: yeah. Well, I mean, okay, so no PG, maybe a couple points higher, but also like. You get more tools in the toolkit for how you can structure. You can use earn outs if you want to. You can incentivize performance. Yeah, if you want to. You're not like strapped in for SBA, so you know, but the caveat is you're probably gonna have to do monthly reporting and still have to do monthly board meetings and have, have more oversight than the SBA might. But again, not necessarily a bad practice to have that kind of accountability and layer. And you know, if we think back to Denise's conversation and she's like, I should have leaned on the, the lender. Well if, if she was having monthly me monthly reporting and quarterly board meetings with someone, they might have been able to be like, Hey. What the hell is going on? Like, this guy shouldn't be doing this. Like, let's get our legal team involved. So she might have, she's like, I should have leaned on the lender more, but also lender didn't even know anything was going on to be able to jump in and help when she needed it. So, um, you know, I, my mind was really changed about investment when I was raising money and, and looking at going after bigger deals because, you know, from my perspective in startup land. You bring in investors, you bring up VCs, they just wanna like pump up the valuation, get an exit, and they don't care at what costs and they're just kind of throwing money at you and you're just giving away so much of your business. And I see these stories on LinkedIn all the time of the inve, the, the founder that like, you know, raised hundreds of millions of dollars and then they were left like 2 million at the end of it or something, you know, for like years of like, and, and so, uh. So I come from startup land where it's like, unless you, like, there's no other way to scale your business than to bring in investors. I'm kind of against it, but when I was going through this, it was like, this puts the control in your hands. 'cause you have the deal. You can go out and find the investors that work for you, the minority, you know, stake in your deal. So like you will maintain, you know, overall governance control, but you're gaining someone that if you choose the right one. Sophisticated has experience and can be a genuine board member. So you're, you're, they're giving you money and you would have to normally pay for that kind of strategy or insight or support or consulting from someone, but they give you money and you get that strategy support consulting from somebody. So my mind really shifted around how the economics and and control work in these types of deals. Um. I only really started scratching the surface in terms, but there's a lot more capital providers like Stonehenge out there, but they typically work on the larger deal sizes. You know, it's like that SBA gray zone of like above 1 million in EBITDA is where they start to to play. So, um, I'm, I'm glad we finally got to bring him on so you, you could see, you know, I think. Everyone here, and even even people not on the call, you are all very. Competent, investible people, you know, which is why Live Oak and Wendy likes you all so much. So the private, private, uh, lender aspect is a really interesting space to potentially play into, or like, you know, should be another person that you reach out to and you have a deal and it's like, okay, I am gonna get term sheets from SBA and speak to them and be able to compare what that looks like.

Justin: Uh, I agree completely. I mean, the, the points differential to me is, is you're actually buying access to something meaningful from a resource, additional resource perspective. So, I mean, you could argue it's not you, you're not even in, in a, in a, like, for like comparison, you're still getting something for that additional interest. Right. And there's, that could actually be incredibly beneficial to the business, you know, at the end of the day. So, uh. I'm, I'm, I'm not against it, you know, at all. Uh, for the right, again, the right investment, the right partners and that kind of thing.

Athena: So, um, one of the things I was gonna say to your earlier point too, Justin, is like. Like on a deal where it's not SBA Financeable, if you've used a partner like this and you go in and do, you know, hopefully grow it to a certain point in five to 10 years, then then you're planning in private equity land as a buyer, right. Or independent sponsor land. So it's not like. Ideally you're getting it out of SBA financeable land, so that different people that would potentially want to buy it are looking at it and then that's not even an issue. Right?

Justin: Sure, yeah.

Athena: And at the size that it's at, you increase it by 50% over the next five, 10 years, and you're kind of looking at that, you know, ideally even more.

Justin: That's spot on. Yeah, it can, I mean, that would be my goal for a business like that. It's exactly what I would shoot for. I mean, they're doing three-ish million top line. So I mean, take that to five, six, you know, in a matter of of years. Then, uh, you, you got the attention of the next echelon of um, those who can cut a check. So then, then the Stonehenge of the world start to like, really, okay, like this is in our wheelhouse. This is what we operate.

Athena: Right? Or you can, uh, did, did the independent sponsor, did that make sense to y'all in terms of what that is? I know we, we kind of touched on it, but did that world make sense or what that is?

Justin: I mean, I, I've heard it a bunch of times on like Acquiring Minds and stuff, so, yeah.

Athena: Right. Okay. Steve, are you familiar with the independent sponsor?

Steve: Maybe not the term, but if you tell me what it is, what it may have.

Athena: So it's, it was, there's, there's this whole world of people that do this too. So it was so funny. I went to the independent sponsor conference and I thought it was gonna be like a couple people, like a little meetup or whatever, and it was like thousands of people. I mean, it was just, there's whole playing field that none of us have ever even seen or are even aware of its existence. So, um, independent sponsors. Okay, there's like, you can raise money in a fund and then go out and buy businesses, right? So like private equity, they go out and raise, they, they have a thesis of like what kind of businesses they're gonna buy and how they're gonna run it, et cetera, et cetera. So they go out and raise money and then they have a certain amount of money to go out and make the acquisitions. But then you have the pressure to actually like, make those acquisitions and, you know, you could end up with. The term dry powder where you have capital that you haven't deployed, that's not making any money back for the people that invested into it. A lot of pressure, right? And then you have to go out and buy things. The alternative to that is independent sponsor, where a sponsor goes out and finds a deal. And then negotiates all the terms of it, and then goes to investors and says, this is my deal. Would you like to invest in this? So it's essentially a fund, but they find the deal first, and then they go out and find the investors for that deal. And they manage it like they would a fund, but it's a specific deal. So I'm gonna take a management fee, I'm gonna take closing fee, but it's gonna be big enough that there's gonna be. Like a C-suite layer in there, and I'm just managing those folks doing that. And I put in a, like, you know, CEO level operator in that I am managing and, but it's, they're bigger place. So we usually north of like 2 million in the EBITDA. But I mean, at that conference, which it's, it's in Dallas every October. If y'all are interested, 'cause there's like a day and a half of it is actually just like investor networking. So if you do your research in advance, then you can schedule like one-to-one meetings with all sort. That's how I met Matt. Um, so you it like, it's a very archaic system and you have to like hand research like every single one to figure out like, would I be a match for them as a potential like, you know, person to invest in. But there's a lot of them coming more downstream into the size of deals that we're looking at. Um, but yeah, so there's a lot of independent sponsors that are looking at like 20 million, 30 million, 50 million EBITDA deals, right? They go out and find those, and then they go and raise money to purchase it, and then they're managing that as a fund. Does that make sense? It's like

Steve: if, if I, if I, uh, net it out, so I, I, I'm in tech, right? So I've worked for companies that are private equity, private equity. They'll come and buy another company, let's say, and they're, they're not, this is, you know, good, not necessarily huge companies, but maybe, uh, revenues in the 10 to 15, $15 million range. They'll go in, they will, they will say it's an investment, but it's really a, it's a loan against it. So they'll come in, uh, they will basically put the private equity, put a note against the business. They'll come in, they'll take a, let's say a 2% management fee. Uh, they'll put CEO in place, CFO, their own people in to run the company, and then they'll take 20% of the net profits. And on the back end, they try to pay the loan down three to five years. Then they flip the company back out and take 20 to 30% of the the profit on it. That's kind of the model, right?

Athena: So that's private equity, but independent sponsors like an individual, right, who goes out and finds the business, raises money for it. And then I manage that as a fund for my investors. I manage that acquisition like I would a fund for my investors.

Justin: So it's just, it's, it's less owner operator in the business. And you're one layer removed managing the fund that is that business where it's got its own layers that's effectively different. Yeah.

Athena: So as an independent sponsor, I might have like three or four different funds, but each one of those fund is like an individual business that I have done the independent sponsor model with

Steve: in comparison to a fund that raises the money and then they have to fill it up with three to five businesses or whatever the size of the fund is. And you know, three years go by, they only found one business and people are ticked off. I, yeah. But now each, each transaction becomes a fund. Exactly.

Justin: Yeah. But to negotiate a deal first, instead of money first, then find the deal. It's, find the deal, negotiate, it's all locked in. And then that becomes the fund effectively.

Athena: So the sponsor gets a closing fee, they get a management fee. So it, the, the mechanics are very fund like, but it's, it's every, every deal is different investors, different terms. Versus like raising all the money under specific terms and then going out and buying three to five businesses with that fund. You're buying three to five business or however many, you know, it's like one business at a time. You buy it, raise the money for it, negotiate the terms with the investors, and that's run differently than maybe your next independent sponsor play.

Steve: It's the model that I see a lot with, like, let's call it, uh, commercial apartment complexes, where somebody will put together the, um, who, who, who's, yeah, syndication. Grant Cardone. Like Grant Cardone puts his little fund together and, but each, each individual building becomes a fund. He takes a finder's fee up front, then he takes a management fee, then he takes part of the profit, and then he manages that. He doesn't actually do, he's not operating the actual property. And then he, on the exit, he makes money as well. So, but it's, it's all about, it's that in each individual property, commercial property is, is another fund that, and he's raised money for, so

Athena: Exactly the same, but for businesses. Yep. Um, and I was fascinated to find out that this world not only existed, but it was so well developed, much more well developed than SBA/ETA, you know, because this is too small for them to, you know, and I think I used the analogy, or not the analogy, the example with Matt. Like, I was talking to this guy, we ended up having le, we were the, you know, only two vegetarians out of like thousands, you know, so like we were, we were having our lunch together and talking about. That. And then he is like, yeah, you know, I have a billion dollars to deploy, so me writing a $5 million check, like I can't do that. You know, it's too much effort to write a check. That's why we need it to be larger deal sizes. So it what? That was what was phenomenal to me. It was like going around there and talking to people and they were like, with your background and experience, go bigger. And I was like, what? Like 8 million was like the level of my comfort zone. So that was like a, it was cool, but B, it was interesting to. This full world existed where it's like too risky for them to write a small check because there's just too much involved. They, you know, need to deploy however much 'cause they are those funds that raised a certain amount of money from their investors that they need to deploy in a certain amount of time to start earning it back.

Justin: I love that idea. I mean, it's, I, I've looked into, you know, working through the general partner in commercial real estate, so I know exactly what she's talking about, and I've, I, I, I'm a limited partner in some of those deals. Mm-hmm. But then I was looking to get on the GP side of the table, and that's effectively what this is, but for businesses, which is I think, even cooler than doing it for real estate. I could see, I could see having a big interest in going down that route once I, you know, pass the sniff test, maybe get an acquisition under my belt and, you know, prove, prove out that I know a little bit about what I'm doing and taking that to the next level. That would be, that would be interesting for sure.

Steve: Well, it's funny to think the exact same way. 'cause that's my end goal. That's where I want to go, but I don't wanna do it until I know what I'm doing. So, yeah.

Athena: And it's much easier to raise as an indie, indie sponsor when you do have a six. You know, it's like they want to know your track record of managing an acquisition. So you do it yourself where you put your all, you know, you put in basically all you had to invest, and you did well by that. That makes you much more investible than somebody that did an MBA that wants to be an independent sponsor.

Justin: Exact same parallel to commercial real estate too. It's like you can't, nobody will wanna invest and throw money, like limited partners don't wanna throw a bunch of passive money at somebody who's never done it before. And just on paper says, well, I could do it. It's like, well. What's your track record? Where have you been? You know, um, yeah, that's, there's so many ca there's so many parallels to real estate. It's crazy.

Athena: Yeah. Um, well good. I'm glad that the conversation was not only useful, but opened up maybe a different capital path for both of you. So Justin, I'm curious, you've spoken to Matt already. We've had this deal that we like love, but it's like, how do we, yeah. So, um, how did that conversation go? And then you've got two live. Deals right now. So how are those? Yeah. Going?

Justin: Yeah, it's going all right. Um, yeah, the broker for the coworking space, I've asked, he did get me. I don't magically, I pushed, I pushed, I was like, can you figure out how to get me a month over month? And magically a trailing 12 just appeared to my inbox. Like, I was like, okay, there we go. So, um, they figured it out. And, uh, and then I said, I asked, I had some follow ups based on some questions that were sticking out, uh, just from the P&L. So I was like, Hey, can we hop back on the line, talk through these, you know, and he and I sent him a couple bullets examples, like, yeah, I'm curious about this, this, this. So he's like, uh, yeah, I think he's trying to work with the seller to find some time to reconnect. So that's where you're there. But I told him. Um, you know, dangling to Carrot. I said, you know, I'm, I'm actively pursuing some alternative lending for this because I, my intent would be to get you, he wants an IOI, I mean, I might skip to just LOI, but, um, my intent, I, I told him would be to get you my intent, like an offer effectively as soon as we can hammer this out. Um, so that's what I'm pushing for. He knows that the broker knows that. Um, so hopefully, yeah, he lines up this chat soon. We can just talk through some of those points. But, uh.

Athena: And you have so much negotiating power because nobody else has figured out how to potentially buy this company.

Justin: That's what I love about it. That's why I'm so excited. I'm so pumped for this and that, and I think even Matt was like, this could be something, you know? He goes, it sounds like the, like, you know, I, he obviously, I signed the NDA, he hasn't seen the sims and everything, but I told him the high level numbers and everything. He goes, it sounds like it. This could be a pretty decent, just on the financials alone, like the ratio seemed good, like could be. Your offer. I go, he goes, what do you think about offering? I go, probably, you know, three, three and a half, multiple, maybe, you know, something that's wearing penciling in. He goes, okay, so like two and a half million, $3 million on the, okay. He's like, oh yeah, this could be good. So, um, yeah, I think he, he sounded really interested in really interested in like finding out if, if whoever's contacts are, would want take a bite of this. Um, so I'm, I'm, I. And I say, I've got somebody who even a, a verbal has given me like, this looks good barring, you know, we passed the test on QoE and, and you know, everything else like measures up and we get the right terms structured that they would be interested. I can't imagine that that. He wouldn't wanna know more about what this could be 'cause Yeah, yeah. I mean, the alternative is they don't sell. And it sounds like based on the chats I've had thus far is that is a real possibility. It's like the seller's just like, you know what I, the alternative is I recommit to growing this thing. I hold onto it, it's cash flowing fine. He is like, so that I think is what I'm up against is in, is inactivity because they don't, he doesn't have to sell.

Athena: So it's a good sign. Like this is always a good sign if. People wanna make introductions. So it means they like you and they like the deal. If somebody's willing to make introductions to other folks that they know because like they do that, you know, like potentially risk that reputation. Also, if you do go down this route, then you have the opportunity to get more creative with the terms to incentivize performance and growth versus just like keep, keep on keeping on. It's like, well, hey. Here's what I'll pay if you know it does this, but here's what I can pay if you help me like grow it and actually transition it or set up a new thing or whatever, you know, so, yep, I like that. Money opens up some of the things that we're not able to use with SBA and they're kind of, you know, it's like either take it or keep Keep it. Yeah. Like they don't have other options right now, which is awesome. So. Okay. That's exciting. So what's, what's next steps on that? You're waiting on map potentially to get back to you with some options.

Justin: Yeah. Waiting on Matt to see what he says. Come early next week on the lending side and then waiting on the broker to set up that chat. Um. Just to kind of talk through some of the questions I, I was, uh, writing down from the P&L, um, some add-backs stuff, you know, some of those things. But, uh, we'll see. Yeah, we'll, those, that's the next steps there. And then, uh, yeah, with the roofing company that's still in play too. Um, he's, I, it's kind of in my, I think it's in my corner now to come back to him with. What ideas I can bring to the table with regards to two of their, two of his, the seller's larger concerns. One is, is the, uh, is not getting his performance. And we've talked about this, but like the performance note I had on full standby, you know, for the 10 years. And, um, he's like, well, maybe, maybe we've gotta do a, uh, a, a, um. I'm having a brain fart. You know what I'm talking about? A, uh, balloon, pretty early balloon. Thank you. I don't know why I couldn't think of that term. Have a balloon, um, midway through, but I'm also running the number and, and this is something that maybe you and I can talk about, like to discuss like, just when I'm putting that in the model, um, because it, I mean, obviously at the balloon year, if massively affects financials, which makes sense. Yeah. So there would have to be some kind of like, uh, you know, uh. Liquidation event or something where it was either a refinance or something right, would, would have to happen because we'd go negative that year. Um, but, uh, but so that's, that's the big one really. That's the big one, is he just doesn't want to, you know, write it up. The upside is, he said he didn't have much pushback on the seller financing, and I had 20 ish percent of seller financing. That was not even performance. Right. A lot of pushback on that part. It was strictly the kind of performance part. And then he did say he, what happens if you sell the business in five years? Because like I had a, a, a full standby of just seller's note that was 10 years. He goes, what happens if you sell in year five? You know? Um, there, so there was that, and then there was the, I guess those three things. And then the other thing was the what happens if the, um, the valuation changes based on EBITDA over the course of due diligence. And so how do, how do we factor that in?

Athena: Okay. So is the ball on your court or theirs right now?

Justin: Uh, mine, well, mine, I, I, I'm trying to stress test this and push him back to see if he'll give me, like, I've asked him like, well, what, uh, John, the seller, he is like, what does John, like, what would make him happier? Goes, the broker's like, yeah, he's having these issues, but then he didn't offer anything like. Here's where he would come to the table, you know? So I'm trying to make them talk first. I'm like, well, what would it take? You know, like, what is he thinking would be reasonable? So we're kind of at this like, game of chicken right now, where I think he's waiting for me to just come to the table with, you know, basically negotiating against myself before they throw anything out. So, you know, I don't know, but it, it, it can, it's effectively in my court if I want to bring a different solution to the.

Athena: Let's look at it tomorrow because we can also model it out with like, you know, if you were to go with someone like Matt, so you can

Justin: look at it. Yeah. And I hadn't even started modeling for like a whole different Yeah. Approach with with Matt, someone like Matt. And this would be in Stonehenge's like Oh yeah. Price range. Yeah.

Athena: Did you talk to him about it by chance?

Justin: I did, I didn't, he didn't, I didn't wanna bother him. He had, he was very generous with his time. Like I just called him out of the blue and left a voicemail. He called me back and we talked mostly around like the, uh, the coworking space one. Um, and I didn't wanna say also I, let me talk to you about this other deal, you know, because at that point that's not,

Athena: that's the, honestly, you're not bothering them when you're bringing them deal flow.

Justin: I know, I, I wanted to, like, wanted him to know, like, I don't know. I mean, I'm happy to talk to him about it. I certainly will. I just didn't wanna put too much on the plate at once, you know?

Athena: I would, I, I would send him a note and be like, Hey, I've got this other deal. I'm negotiating an LOI on here's top line numbers. Is this like, is this something you'd also be interested if, so like, let's schedule a call. I, it doesn't hurt, honestly.

Justin: Okay. Yeah. I mean, he said call,

Athena: like if he likes you, is it potential like, and he is passing a deal off to somebody else, then actually bringing up a deal that they could invest in themselves isn't a waste of their time.

Justin: I mean, true, true. I guess worst slash best case is like they're both in play and then I'm like, oh, great, what do I do? You know?

Athena: Exactly. But then you have something to choose from and we like that. Yeah, because then you're negotiating from,

Justin: maybe that's in the back of my head is I don't wanna like dangle a carrot with Matt. Be like, yeah, I also wanna talk to you. If the coworking one takes point, takes poll position, and I'm like, okay, I'm not gonna move on that one. Matt. I don't know. I just don't wanna, I don't want him to spin his wheels unless there's something like meaty, you know?

Athena: Well, I mean, you can say like, look, I'm, I'm very excited about both of these. Both are not under offer, which is why I'm entertaining them, you know? Sure, true. Yeah. I'm negotiating an LOI on this one. Is this something that you would be interested in? If so, like, let's talk.

Justin: Yeah, I can do that. I'll, uh, I mean, he said call, like if he likes you, is it potential like, and he is passing a deal off to somebody else, then actually bringing up a deal that they could invest in themselves isn't a waste of their time.

Athena: Yeah, let's, and let's go through it tomorrow, like model up some numbers, like if you were to look at something like that, and also with the balloon, how that might look like. Um, also for the benefit of everyone, check your NDA, you should be able to talk to. Um, capital providers for it, um, like, you know, your lending team, deal team, that sort of thing. Usually in the NDA. You're covered for that. And then ada, do me a favor and let's dig out the, uh, NDA non circumvention template. For folks to use when they're going to speak to potential investors. And let's drop that as a resource both for Justin and then on the dashboard. Um, Anka and I can help you find where that is, but, um, then you, like, I wanna say they're regulated so they shouldn't be circumventing, so just ask him. But like, if you're going to investors that aren't necessarily like SBIC or whatever, um, it's. Just two different things you could do. Some investors get annoyed about signing NDAs, right. And non circumvention. But you know, like if it's, if you're a serious person, it's a serious deal. It's far along, it's less of a issue than having like random tire kickers, like kick the tires and that sort of thing. So, um, but typically a non circumvention is like preventing. You bringing a deal to someone and then them going around you and trying to go after it themselves. So if it's somebody that could do it themselves, then you want to probably have them sign it. If it's somebody that's literally a capital provider that wants deals brought to them, then likely they're not gonna do that. Right?

Justin: Yeah. Um.

Athena: So we'll get that resource for you, Justin, just so you have it available and everybody has it available. And then we can talk through the specifics tomorrow. But I mean, it sounds like you have two really good op opportunities in play.

Justin: Yeah, yeah. And totally aside, we can briefly touch on it, but I talked with the Transworld, uh, brokers who I told you Oh, right. Have that complete. Well, I met with them and the seller for that business today, and that's a quirky one, but I, anyway, if we, we can talk, I'll, I'll, I don't wanna devote too much time to that one, but I can catch you up to speed on all that tomorrow for sure. Yeah,

Athena: please do. We'll be, uh, interested to hear, with the time we have left Steve, uh, any movement on y'all's, uh, franchise opportunity.

Steve: Uh, Polly went to visit a franchise on Oh, good. Friday or Saturday. Uh, I'm in, I. It must have been. Yeah. So she left on Sunday here. I haven't seen Polly in a week, so I was gone and she was gone. So she's at her, she's driving back from her mom. She's, she's killing me. She, she discovered, uh, how awesome Acquiring Minds is. So on the six and a half hour ride each way, she actually listened to a, an Acquiring Minds on franchises.

Athena: Oh, great.

Steve: Yeah. I haven't gotten the, uh, download on it yet, but, uh, yeah. So you created a monster there. Uh, she's all over it and, but the, um. Yeah. Yeah. So there's, there's, uh, she did go see that was, that was like a, the big next step. Uh, also I believe the, they wanted an LOI or an IOI in by Friday or something like that.

Athena: Oh, okay. So you guys gotta move quick.

Steve: No, no, it was last Friday. They wanted it in.

Athena: Oh, okay.

Steve: And P'S like, it's just not happening by Friday. And, uh, you just said, Hey, when there's stuff going on, we're going to the holiday week. And the broker came back, said, well, that's kind of a theme right now. So they don't have any IOIs or LOIs in yet. Right. While we were speaking right now, I just saw that it popped in the email from the broker. Just wanted to show you that somebody put, we, we expect to have an LOI this week. Uh, so we're, we're gonna, we're gonna continue to dig into that. It's not a no. Uh, it's, yeah, there's, there's some, I think we talked a little bit about some of the, you know, question marks and, uh, I know Polly's been, Polly really likes the broker. I'll say that much.

Athena: Okay.

Steve: She said he's super interesting and also offered up, Hey, if this is not the right deal for you, um, you know, there's this one or just two brokerages dealing with right now, but one of 'em said this is not the right deal that, you know, we'll find you the right deal and, and that type of deal for, for local stuff in our area. Anyway, so. Good progress there. I'm glad she went out to see an owner. Uh, she'll have some feedback for you tomorrow on what that was like, uh, as far as

Athena: can't wait to hear about that. Um, and then, uh, I've already told Justin this, but for your benefit too, Steve, the brokers will get, they get really excited when there's a qualified buyer. Um, so feel free to tell them like, Hey, yeah, any deals that you think might be a good fit, send them to Luke and the team so they can give them a first pass just to save you the time. Because when they, when they realize you're serious and qualified and have money, they'll start throwing everything at you.

Steve: Our, our, our mode of action is if, if there's another deal, it's coming through you first anyway. 'cause we don't, you know, just, it's just, it's. It's gonna go through you anyway, so why would do it on the back end just here, but you know, just getting the relationship to get the constant contact is really what the, what, what the motivation was there.

Athena: Absolutely. No, no, no, no, no. I It's good right when they get excited about you. But I was just saying to when, when they get excited about you, be like, absolutely. Make sure Luke has a first pass at it so he can vet it and make sure. Otherwise they'll, they'll just come to you directly and start sending you everything.

Justin: I'm on a Transworld email list now where I get every junk business and podunk where, I mean, it's just.

Athena: Yeah, but anything you hear about or see that you're interested in, like flag it with the team and they'll, they, they probably have already requested on it and are going through the vetting process, but just in case, uh, I would, I would to save yourself the, the headache but preserve the relationship too. So you're like super excited. Please send me everything, but make sure Luke has a look at it first, you know, um, or send it directly to Luke and we will, we'll just. Discuss it, you know, and then, then it saves you having to go through a bunch of junk. Um, also eda, can you, um, maybe just send Polly a note on her channel and ask her what episodes she might recommend for franchises because, um, we're always looking for good Acquiring Minds episodes that we can recommend to people. So let's see if she, she liked any of 'em and thinks it's worth recommending. Awesome. Well, I love this discussion. This was, uh, fun. I love talking about this stuff, especially when it's like. I feel like it's still largely undiscovered in the whole ETAS and B world, the private debt space. So it hasn't been spoiled necessarily, where you have people like Matt that are like, yeah, please contact me. Because I imagine in a year it won't once, once, once everybody else catches onto this stuff. I don't think that it will be that way. So,

Justin: agreed.

Athena: Yeah. Amazing. Well, I'm excited to catch up with you guys individually and then, um, Steve, if you are gonna get an offer together, maybe if you guys wanna, um, have prepared tomorrow, like what you're, what's holding you back from moving forward, what you'd need answered and or, you know, start to get an offer together. We can go through that too.

Steve: I, I'll let you know because Polly's driving right now, so I don't know much. She's even to show up, so I, I have no idea. But yeah. Great. Sounds good. And I don't even, I don't know what she's thinking after the visit. She might have said, nah, she might be No.

Athena: Yeah. Over it. Okay. I can't wait to hear.

Steve: We just haven't had that. We, we don't, we don't like to have like three minute conversations, bits and bites over the phone type of deal. It's like, all right, let's sit down. Let's go over this. Okay. What do you like? What don't you like? Let's kind of net it out. Um, so we, we have not had that discussion yet since I haven't seen her.

Athena: Amazing. Good. Okay. Well I'm excited to hear the update and, uh, Justin, I'm excited on, um, these two also, and I, I, I wouldn't, I wouldn't, uh, I, Matt might be excited to hear about something that they could potentially do also, so, um, maybe see if he bites and then we can go through both tomorrow.

Justin: I will.

Athena: Awesome. Sounds good. Well, have a great rest of your day y'all. See you tomorrow.

Justin: Sounds good. See ya.
