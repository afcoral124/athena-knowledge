Purpose: Buyers Club session on transitioning into ownership and operating post-close
---

[00:00:46]
Athena: Good stuff. Good timing too. So really excited for today's conversation. I think a few more people are, might be joining, uh, the live chat, but I know quite a few people had it bookmarked to watch the replay too.

So, um, super excited to have John here. I met John and heard him speak at SMBash back in Utah in 2024, um, and was really impressed and excited about the way he thought about businesses and the systems that went within them and, and how to kind of look at it as an owner to make your whole business run more efficiently.

Um, and then we got to speaking quite in depth at this year's LA event, and we were just talking about that kind of transition into ownership, the hard landing that it has. And found out John actually does a lot of work around that as well. So buying a business and then transitioning into an owner and, and how you do that effectively.

So [00:02:00] that's basically the point of the conversation today: are you ready for that transition and the things that you should think about going into it. Um, and this is an exclusive first time he's done this talk, so we are getting brand new content out of his mouth, which I'm so excited about. So, um, John, thank you so much for being here, for taking the time to put this together and, and share your, uh, many years of wisdom, which should help all of us as business owners and future business owners.

So welcome to our buyers club. 

John: All right, well, thank you for having me. Um, so many years of wisdom—that's the euphemism for, I'm so old, but, uh, that's okay. We're gonna start with a quiz today. And the quiz is fill in the blank: The purpose of a business is to create blank. So go ahead and put in the chat, or if you're hearing the recording of this, just put it on your phone or jot down what the purpose [00:03:00] of a business is to create.

When I ask this, I typically get answers like wealth, solving problems, uh, improving the world. These are all really good answers. They're all wrong, but they're really good ones. And while we're waiting, uh, before I give you the true answer, I wanna tell you my story, 'cause you should be asking also, who is this guy and why should I even listen to him?

Uh, I can't answer that second one. You'll have to answer that yourself, but I can tell you the first one. Um, I have never had a job. I've always had companies. That sounds like the introduction to a, uh, 12-step program. I'm John Seiffer. I've always had companies, and I was a remote CEO starting in 1993 when the internet didn’t make it very easy to do that.

I moved 1500 miles away from my company because I wanted to be where I wanted to live, and it didn't make sense to move the company. They literally had to overnight me data tapes so I could see what was [00:04:00] going on. What happened was I ended up kind of working myself out of a job. The company kept growing, but I was working less and less, and I.

Somebody I used to work with said, you ought to look into this thing called coaching. I'd never heard of it outside of sports. And she said, oh, you'd be great at it. And I got some training and started coaching other business owners sort of to do what I had done. And in the process, a bunch of us started the International Coach Federation.

I was their fourth president in 1998, and they're up to like 50,000 members worldwide now. I'm also an author. Thank you. Some of you are reading my book, Output Thinking, and I've been coaching business owners since the late nineties, and I've learned a lot of things from my own companies and from the companies that I've, uh, coached.

So the real answer to that question: there's only one valid definition of a business purpose, and that's to create a customer. And that's from Peter Drucker. Because if you don't have a [00:05:00] customer, you don't have a business. You might have a great hobby, you might have a great product, you might have a charity.

You can have all kinds of things, but it's not a business. So a customer is somebody that pays you, and they pay you for something. They want some value that they want more than they want their money. Think of the last time you bought something. Maybe you bought a cup of coffee earlier today. Maybe you paid for a parking spot, maybe you bought a car.

I don't know. You wanted that thing more than you wanted that money. So the question is, how does a company create a customer? And I'm glad you asked. There's actually a model of every successful company that every successful company follows. And it's something that I've discovered and worked out over 25 years of being an entrepreneur and a business coach.

There's lots of different names for this. People talk about Entrepreneurial Operating Systems and Scaling Up and, uh, V2MOM, I just heard of one. They're basically, if you strip out [00:06:00] the titles and the names that they put on stuff, it's all the same way because there's really only a basic way to build a company and the model looks like this.

We're gonna get into all these different parts later on in the talk, but I want to tell you, when you first take over a company, it doesn't look like this, especially if you've never run a company before. When you first take it over, it tends to look like this. In fact, I have a video of a searcher walking into his new company the first day after closing, and I want to play that video for you now.

So that's what it can feel like. And your goal is to take the image on the left here and somehow convert it to the one on the right. And you want it to look and to actually work like this, where the [00:07:00] CEO is the person who's coordinating everything, pulling everybody together like the conductor of an orchestra.

The conductor doesn't make any of the music, and yet the conductor walks on stage at the beginning, gets a round of applause. Isn't that wonderful? And what you're hoping is that when you buy a company, the seller who has been this conductor will very quietly step out of the picture and you'll be in that picture and all the musicians will stay in place and the music will never stop.

Unfortunately, at the beginning, it doesn't feel like this. It usually feels more like this. And this is the time when I get to share all the horror stories that I've seen in small companies. And these are all true, by the way. One company that I know of—this is a company that manufactures things and then they inventory them, and they have to spend a lot of money to make them and store them.

And these are [00:08:00] sold throughout the country through, uh, distributors and various sales reps. And doing it this way is actually a moat for this company because it takes a lot of money to invest to make the product, and then they get the reward over many, many years. And so it's hard for competitors to jump in. But the problem was when they bought the company, there was an intermediary in between them and the reps and the distributors who would collect the cash and then be sending it back to them.

What they didn't know at the time was that this intermediary was big on paying favorites, and so they would dribble out the cash to this company in slow bits, and this guy was just tearing his hair out 'cause he didn't have the cash to expand his company, to keep running. And it didn't quite put him outta business, but it really slowed him down at first.

There's another company that I know of where two women bought a landscaping [00:09:00] company, and these were professional women. One was in the military, another one was in another branch of government, and they bought this company together, and they found out after a few weeks actually that the seller was competing with them.

He was taking his old customers back. He was poaching some of his employees. They were just gut punched. They were like, oh my God, what can we do? Well, obviously their deal had a non-compete clause. So they said, okay, we'll just take him to court. Well, they took him to court and they started getting the lawyers involved, and it started getting very, very expensive.

And one of them told me at some point the court case was balanced on what's the definition of landscaping, and they were tearing their hair out. What do you mean, what's the definition? This guy's competing with us. And they finally came to the realization that they had just paid this guy millions of dollars, which he had to fight the lawsuit, and they didn't have that kind of money to fight the lawsuit.

And [00:10:00] so they just backed off and said, well, this is just one more competitor. Landscaping is not, you know, we're not the only one in town. We'll just go ahead and, and keep working in spite of that, and that's what they've done. But it was really gut wrenching for them. I have another company—oh, this is a client of mine.

I was coaching. We got on a regular coaching call and I said, well, you know, what's going on? He said, oh, it's been a hell of a week. I said, tell me. He said, Thursday morning I came in, I got a phone call—my plant manager was dead on the floor of the plant. I said, oh my God. He said, yeah, this guy was an older man.

Been there for a long time. Everybody loved him. He lived alone. They went through the security footage of the cameras, and he was the last one the night before in the shop. He was just putting things away and cleaning up, and all of a sudden basically had a heart attack and fell over. Not only had this entrepreneur now had to deal with, I don't have a plant manager anymore, but he had his own personal [00:11:00] grief for this man who everybody loved.

And then he was also the leader of his team and he had to help them go through this grief. You may know Costa's story. He is a man—uh, this is public, so I can use his name. He's written about this in his newsletter. He bought a tree company in Seattle, Washington, and he had a newsletter article the other day—maybe it was a few weeks ago now—his worst day in business. His team had driven a truck—a big, big tree truck with a chipper towed on the back of it—and they parked on a street that they'd been at before. They set the brakes, they put the chocks in the wheels, they got out of the truck, started doing their work.

Fifteen minutes later, the truck rolls down the hill, bumps into a parked car, pushes that parked car down the hill through an intersection into another parked car that it pushed into a tree. The truck [00:12:00] smashes into a house, broke a water main, the house is getting soaked in the basement. The truck is incapacitated.

Luckily, nobody was hurt. There was nobody in any of the vehicles. Uh, not a good day at work, you know. Um, I know of a company—this was actually the worst investment I ever made—partly because I didn't know what I was doing as an investor, but the owner found out that his general manager was having an affair with his wife, with the owner's wife.

So he lost both his wife and his general manager. I had two clients who were putting in ERP systems around the same time, unrelated to each other. ERP, if you don't know, stands for Enterprise Resource Planning, and it's a major computer system that controls everything in your company from inventory, production, scheduling, CRM, and accounting.

So you have to move all your other systems into this one thing, which [00:13:00] means if you are doing your accounting in QuickBooks, you now have to do it in the ERP. Well, both of these companies—their bookkeepers would not work with the new ERP system, but rather than—this is not a quick process; this had been going on for six, eight months—and the bookkeepers never said anything until the day that they were about to go live, the month that they were about to go live.

Both of them got a notice from their—in one case, the CFO and in one case the bookkeeping company—who said, Hey, we're not gonna work with you anymore. Bye. Just literally that blunt. And they were both just shocked. One of them said, look, okay, I can deal with the bookkeeping piece, you know, it'll be a month, few weeks before I can do my month close.

That's not a big deal. Can you at least hang in there 'cause I need to do payroll right away. And you've been doing my payroll. And the woman at the bookkeeping company said, no, we have a company policy. We don't do payroll unless we're also doing the bookkeeping. Guy was tearing his hair [00:14:00] out. Um, the last one I'll tell you: there's a small company.

A woman bought this textile company. They sold throws and blankets and they do it wholesale to hotels, but they also had a retail shop. It was a very small company, 10 people, and all around the same time the ops person broke her leg, the key salesperson was diagnosed with ovarian cancer, and the business owner herself was in a car accident, got a concussion.

So this is not always, uh, rainbows and unicorns. Well, maybe it's unicorns 'cause they don't exist either. But the reason I'm telling you this is that despite all of these kinds of things that happen in small companies, many people love it. And myself, I love entrepreneurship and I have to tell you why I love it: because of the freedom that it gives me, the potential that it has, the control that I have over my life [00:15:00] and my work.

And of course, the money's not bad either, but I encourage you to figure out what it is about you that loves entrepreneurship because it's a—as the saying goes—long and winding road. And if you don't love the journey as well as the destination, it's gonna be a tough road for you. It's probably gonna be tough anyway, but if you don't know why you're here, you may not last if you're just in it for the investment potential.

Good luck. Um, I was reading a post on social media the other day by an M&A lawyer who I respect actually and writes a lot of good stuff. And he was talking about the benefits of picking up a small company. And at the end of this post, he said, we love route-based businesses like trash bin cleaning, pest control, HVAC.

We love it when the owner works less than 10 hours a week. It's got 20% margins and there's [00:16:00] no online marketing yet. We love sellers buying those kinds of companies. And then he ended his post by saying, buy small, polish, automate, raise prices, win—as if it was all that easy. Well, the truth is, yeah, you would like to be able to do that, and many times you can do that.

But saying it that way—it's not so easy. It may not be easy to polish; it may not be easy to automate. In fact, many times the things that you can automate are not the core aspects of running your company. If you have a pest control company, we're not at the place yet where robots can actually do the pest control work.

You might be able to automate your bill paying and some of your sales and that kind of thing. Uh, raising prices might be possible, might not; depends on your market and all kinds of other things. And yes, hopefully you will win. The reason I say this is because deals are sexy, but the [00:17:00] money is made in operations.

So let's talk for a minute about how you make that money, particularly as a new owner. As a new owner, you have three jobs and you have to do them in this order. The first job is to keep things working. Now, this assumes that you're not buying a turnaround, that you're buying a company that is actually working.

And so you have to keep it going. Second job, learn how it's working. And the third is you want to make it better. 'Cause you don't buy a company just to keep it where it is. You keep it—you want to buy it to grow. So you have to do these in the right order. Let's look at these in more detail. So job one, keep things going.

You have to prepare for the first day that you're gonna take over. There will be an announcement. You have to share your vision for why you're there, why you picked this company, why you believe in this team. There are many different ways to do this. I know a guy who was buying, uh, [00:18:00] plumbing companies and he said every time he did this on day one, he would give everybody a brand new hundred-dollar bill.

He would talk about buying new trucks. I don't know if he was able to keep that pace up every time he bought more and more companies, but, uh, something like that, because people will be nervous that their job is at stake. And so you wanna reassure them that their job is safe—assuming that it is; you don't wanna lie. Then you should plan setting your vision.

You should plan to meet with people one-on-one, meet with as many as you can as soon as you can. And listen. Ask them what would they do if they were the CEO? You'll be surprised how many really good ideas they have. And even when they don't have good ideas, take their ideas seriously and get back to them that you have thought about those ideas.

And during this initial time of transition, be sure that you under-promise and over-deliver. Trust has to be earned, and [00:19:00] trust is earned by doing what you say you're going to do. People will notice really quickly. So make sure that you don't over-promise and under-deliver—do it the other way around. The other thing you need to do to keep things working is figure out what your R&Rs are—your roles and responsibilities, what R&R means.

But I prefer the word outputs, because the reason you hire somebody or the reason you do work in a company is to produce the outputs of the work. It's not for the work itself. And those outputs are often not related to people's job titles. Most people in most companies produce multiple different outputs, and only some of them are related to their job titles.

And you can get confused if you just focus on the job titles. That's why I shy away from just the titles of R&R. And each output that is required to be produced in a [00:20:00] company has a frequency attached to it. Some things have to happen every day, some things have to happen every week, some every month, some as needed.

Each output fits on that model that I showed you before, and so you wanna make sure that you are aware of which outputs now have been dumped in your lap. If you take over from a remote owner who's not been there, what that usually means is that you will not be inheriting R&Rs or outputs that are required to be done daily or weekly.

It will be less frequent. But if that owner was in there working every day—you gotta figure out who's gonna do that work. And if it's not you, who will it be? And the other thing about this is we all like the saying, work smarter, not harder. But the truth is, you have to work harder to learn what's going on before you can work smarter.

So get in there, get your hands dirty, roll up your sleeves, get to work. The [00:21:00] next thing I suggest to keep things working is to get a CEO notebook and write your thoughts every day. At the end of the day, write down what you've learned, what confused you, what questions you have, and do it in a way that feels special.

If you like to write longhand, get a fancy notebook—something leather, maybe something with a fountain pen, whatever floats your boat. If you can't read your handwriting like I can't read mine, then get something electronic, but something special. I use OneNote, but you use whatever works for you in a special place where you just keep your CEO notebooks.

My only rule for this is you do it every day and you date every entry. And the reason for that is as you go back and read these things, you won't remember: was that the thing I wrote before we got that new printer system, or was that the thing that—was I thinking this before Jill left and we hired Sam to replace her? You don't [00:22:00] know. Put the dates in. Other than that, make it be your journal. Make it be everything that you're thinking. Get it out of your head and onto some paper. You'll be amazed how writing stuff down clarifies your thinking. So those are some things you can do to keep things working.

The next job, like I said, is to learn how it's working, and that means fill these different buckets. And we're gonna get into each of these in detail now, and I call it buckets because, like I said, you hire people to produce the outputs of their work, and those outputs fall into what I call these buckets. It's a much clearer term than departments or teams or something like that. And the green ones there in the middle—that's the core of what you need to do. That's your selling and your fulfillment. You're finding customers who wanna buy what you make, and you're giving them the value that they pay you money for. That's your core.

Beneath [00:23:00] that are a lot of other activities that you have to do that are what's called context. They support the fulfillment and the sales. But if you do these context things well, you don't get brownie points for that. However, if you don't do them well, you're gonna get in trouble. These are things like people—hiring the right people, managing those people, putting 'em uh, in the right seats on the bus, as it says; designing the organization, making sure that the information flows to where it needs to flow, that it's documented properly.

Tracking the money—the money has to come in, the money has to come out. And also that flow of money has an incredible amount of information about your company, so you want to be able to do that financial analysis. And then the other two of these context pillars are CAFE and Advisor Stack. That's bringing in expertise from outside the company and doing things that protect you—like insurance—and that you have the right facilities, that you're in compliance, those [00:24:00] kinds of things.

This whole stack here rests on what I call the conditions of your company. These are conditions that you generally can't change. The market conditions, the competitive conditions, the technological conditions. Uber, for example—if you think about Uber outside of technology, it's a taxi service. Well, there were taxis before there were automobiles. People would hire, you know, a horse and buggy to take them places. But Uber couldn't be Uber without the technology getting to where it needed to be. And so these are the conditions within which your company operates.

And from that condition, you develop a strategy of how to exploit those conditions. And then at the top of that diagram is your motivation. Why are you here? And by here, I mean in this particular business, at this particular time of your life. What do you and any other owners that you have—what do you want from the company? And to serve that [00:25:00] motivation, you have outputs that go into growth, vision, goal setting, planning, et cetera.

And these will help you grow your company in a way that you and the other owners get what you want from the company. Here's what I mean. If you want to flip this company—to build it, get a higher multiple, sell it in five or six years—you're gonna grow it in one way. If you wanna keep that company for 30 years and live off of it and reinvest the cash flow into either other companies or other things in your life, you are going to grow that company in a whole different way.

And so that affects how you do all the other stuff. When you put all these things together and you've learned how it's working, then that's when this model fits, and that's when you can be the conductor and not so much the firefighter. So once you've figured out where all the pieces go [00:26:00] into a model like this, then you can move on to job three, which is how do you make it work better? Which means how do you make more throughput, more customers, more providing more value to them, and obviously make more money? That's job three.

And I have a picture here that reminds me of Chesterton's Fence. If you haven't heard that saying, it's a quote by a guy named G.K. Chesterton from the 1850s, I think it was. He was a philosopher and author of that time, and he said—and all this is a kind of a long quote—in the manner of reforming things as distinct from deforming them, there's a plain and simple principle. There exists in such case a certain institution or law—let's say for the sake of simplicity, a fence or a gate—erected across the road. The more modern type of reformer goes gaily up to it and says, I don't see the use of this. Clear it away. To which the more intelligent type of [00:27:00] reformer will do well to answer: If you don't see the use of it, I certainly won't let you clear it away. Go away and think, and then when you can come back and tell me that you do see the use of it, I may allow you to destroy it.

What that means is when you go into this company, everything that's happening there—every policy, every position of every piece of equipment, et cetera—every decision that's made was made for a reason. That reason may not be useful anymore, but if you don't know what that reason was, you're in danger of destroying something that you didn't find out about till later.

Uh, I'm thinking of a client that bought a company and there was a woman there who had been there for a long time, and she was kind of one of these people that just did a lot of stuff, but he didn't quite know what and why and how. And at one point he'd been there six or eight months and it was time to renew some insurance contracts. [00:28:00] And she knew all this stuff in the back of her head, and he goes, I never would've thought about that. It was never documented anywhere. She just had this in the back of her mind. So if you don't know why these things are there, don't move them.

Everything that happens in their company happens on what I call the DAM scale. So the DAM scale means at one end of this scale, there's grandma. That's the lady on the left. This is what I call grandma in the kitchen with no recipe, but she makes great food. Holiday dinners are wonderful. Birthdays are terrific. It's great, but because it's all in her head, she can't get anybody to do what she does.

You can't scale up a company like that, and you'll likely find lots of grandmas in the kitchen in your company. These are wonderful people with a lot of wisdom and a lot of experience, but it's not always scalable. At the other end of the DAM scale is what I call a [00:29:00] robust company, where all these outputs are being produced in ways that are repeatable and scalable.

And the reason I call it the DAM scale, it stands for: Is it Documented? Is there someone Accountable? Are there Metrics? And is it subdivided? And as you start to look through the company, you wanna look at these things, and to make it better, it needs to be on the other side of the DAM scale. And the real magic happens with this last one.

The first three are pretty obvious: Is it documented? Is there somebody accountable? Are there metrics? The last one is a little more subtle, and that's: Is the system subdivided? What I mean by that is, as companies grow and as the outputs are produced by systems, you can subdivide those systems into subsystems.

So take sales, for example. Small company—one person's doing all the sales: they're doing the outreach, they're maybe going to the [00:30:00] trade shows, they're producing the ads, they're doing whatever they do on the web, the social media. And as leads come in, they qualify them. They may also then do the presentations. They may put together the proposals. They nurture those leads, they close the deals—they're doing the whole sales thing.

At some point it gets too busy for one person and that person isn't great at all those parts. And then you say, you know what? We need somebody who's really good at the marketing side, so we're gonna subdivide this. We're gonna make a marketing person and a sales person. The marketing person will generate leads, hand those over to the sales person, they will close the deals. We can grow that way.

And eventually some of those pieces will get subdivided. So you might have a social media marketing person and you might have a trade show marketing person, and you might have, uh, on the sales side, you might have somebody doing the presentations and somebody else closing the deals, et cetera.

This is where the magic happens, because as you subdivide these systems, what [00:31:00] happens is you move the work down, you move the decisions down, and down in this case means from the owners to costly talent to lower-cost talent, ultimately to automation and AI. Now you're not gonna be able to do that in everything, but you can do that in some parts of some of the systems.

And that means you can reduce the cost and you can get greater throughput through the company. So your model now is expanded by putting things on the more robust side of the DAM scale. And so that's the model that I have developed over the years to help companies grow and to help owners actually get what they want from running their companies—which really, that's the point of why we do what we do.

So I have developed this into a part of my coaching that I call After The Close so that you can hit the ground running. This is for searchers who just bought a company, and we go through these different parts of [00:32:00] the model. Um, I offer a free coaching session where you can go to aftertheclose.biz and click on that QR code if you want.

And, um, we can talk about what I can do to help you hit the ground running after the close. So at this point, I will open it up to questions and, uh, let me know what you think. 

Athena: Well, that was so awesome, um, and bringing all together for the, the kind of why. Actually the story you were telling about Denise—she actually came on to Buyers Club and told the full story, everything here. So if you saw some nodding during that, they, um, I think Luke described that as a Netflix episode. It was, uh, you know, I got to hear it a couple times, SMBash. So, um, I love the, um, different buckets and the grandma in the kitchen thing.

Um. [00:33:00] I think the one thing is like, how long do you need to observe and learn before you start making changes, right? Like, we hear this a lot. People take over a business and they start making changes day one. Or there's things that absolutely must be changed sometimes, like bank accounts. But what do you see there and what's, you know, is there a general recommendation for how long you wait before you start making any changes or how to decide when to make those changes?

You know, you have a laundry list of all the things you want to change. Like what do you do? 

John: That's a great question. I don't think there's any specific answer that fits. I think it depends on the thing. It depends on the company. Some things you might want to change right away. And a lot of that will come from your listening tour.

When you start meeting with people and you start hearing, [00:34:00] you know, many of them say the same thing—Oh God, if I was the CEO, I would change this. I don't know why he did that. I don't know why she did that. And those are things, if the change is quick, if the change is reversible, uh, do it as much as you can. Do it as quickly as you can.

But some of these things that take longer and that have much more, much greater impact, uh, you don't want to change them too quickly because you wanna make sure that everybody who's involved—you've got input from everybody who's involved. So that's a bad answer to an easy question, but, you know, it's really about learning what would be the ramifications of that change.

And you can run that by the other people—you know, the grandmas in the kitchen. Say, what if I did change this? Uh, and I say grandmas—it's kind of, you know, I don't mean to be, um, dismissive of those people. These are many times people who have been there for 20 years who have incredible wisdom and experience in this stuff.

And you can ask them, What would happen if we did it this way? What are the things I'm not aware of? Get them on your [00:35:00] team and help them—get them to help you make those changes. 

Athena: Yeah, I love the analogy because, um, grandma gets dinner out on time for 20 people after cooking all day, and any of us, like me or humans, try to do that, and it still takes me three days to be able to do a multi-course dinner. So, uh, there's a lot of value there. Something you said that you said very quickly, but I wanna like—uh, I hate this phrase, but it makes sense—double click on, as you said, as long as it's quick and reversible. So the reversible part, I think, is one to pull out. Like, what do you mean by that and why is that an important factor? 

John: So actually most decisions in most companies can be reversed if they're wrong. Let's say, um, you extend credit to a client who's not great—well, you can, you know, it's probably not gonna kill you [00:36:00] if they don't pay or if they pay slow.

Uh, on the other hand, if you fire some really incredible people and you didn't know how incredible they were, that's not so reversible. Um, you know, it's, it's, uh, you don't wanna just write that kind of thing off. Um, so think about if this decision is wrong, what can I do to backtrack? What's my plan B? And the good news about that is as you start building, um, the systems and the subsystems in your company, you actually wanna push as many decisions down into the organization as you can.

You wanna distribute that wisdom that's in grandma's head into recipes so that everybody can follow them so that decisions are made the same way, no matter who makes them. And the easiest decisions to push throughout the company first are ones that, if somebody messes up, they can be fixed. 

Athena: Yeah, I hear you.

[00:37:00] 

Peter: Uh, this is—I mean, this is, this is just—you can't see it, but it's on my Kindle, but all right. Yeah, it's like, it's like literally in my office right now. How nerdy is that? All right? Yeah. Amazing. That's—

Athena: Okay, Peter. Peter actually is an admirer too, so, uh, okay. He's got an interesting story. But Peter, what's your question or thought, John? 

Peter: All right. I, I, I'm the guy who just came in day one and, you know, there were a lot of fences in the business and I, for some reason, didn't read in the, uh, uh, memorandum that we were in the fence business. So I removed a bunch of fences and it was stupid. Uh, but that—that's—so some of the things you're saying, I've already lived and I'm like, okay. Terrible manner.

John: And you're still here?

Peter: Yeah. One version of me is. Uh, my question [00:38:00]—you know, as I think about, you know, just output—you know, your book has been thinking about a lot about just the outputs of various people, and it's something that, uh, is tied to accountability. It's much easier to—you know, we've had a lack of accountability because, uh, it's like, I just don't know what people should be accountable for. But once you're thinking output, it's like, yeah, once you define the output, it's like, yep, that's you.

Um, can continuous learning be an output for a manager? Right? Like, I, I have two managers in this business and I'm like, you know, I know it's an advantage as the future happens because the world's changing so fast if somebody's not constantly learning. And—but I don't know how to make that an output, I guess. 

John: Okay, good, good question. An output is something that's visible.

Okay. So if somebody were learning, how would you know? Like, let's say you saw that person work today and [00:39:00] a month from now, you saw that person work and you say, wow, they've really learned—well, what do you mean by that? You probably mean they're making better decisions or they're doing something quicker, or they're making fewer mistakes.

So that's what we really mean by learning. Yeah. And so if you can define what those decisions look like, what those lack of mistakes looks like, then you can define the learning.

Peter: Got it.

John: You know, and there's some people—usually at lower levels in the organization—where, I was talking to a client today: two people in his organization. One runs the tool room—he is the only guy in the tool room—and another one is an accounts receivable clerk and filing. And neither of them were doing a really good job. And it just—[00:40:00] they put a manager check-in with them on a weekly basis, and it turns out that's what they needed. It just needs somebody to oversee them on a regular basis. How's this going? You know, and it would be nice if people could just do their job without that, but some people can't. And that's what you have to figure out if you can—if you need that.

Now, those people are obviously not in line for promotion, you know, but the question that he had to decide was, is it easier to replace that person or not? And in this case, he said, well, you know, it's not that onerous to have somebody manage them on a regular basis, a team leader. And, and, uh, so we put those things in place. So those people aren't necessarily learning, but they're doing better. And the company is learning that these people need to be managed tighter.

I dunno if that answers your question, but that's—think about what you would see differently from a person who has learned than before they learned. 

Peter: Yeah. That's what will show you what's going on. Beautiful. Thank you. That was helpful. 

Athena: Um, as Peter was [00:41:00] sharing that, I was—Peter, I'm—have they been resistant to learning or do they know what's in it for them to learn? Because I find that ends up being a lot more motivating if you like, paint the destination of like what the learning is gonna get them to. And that learning also gets you the output that you want. So it is like the, I want to learn because it's going to impact me or the business, but why? How am I gonna get them to wanna learn and like, how do they see what's in it for them or be motivated to want to learn, you know?

So for the team here, it's like, well, the learning's going to get you the next promotion or get you that next growth opportunity, you know? And when you paint that track. But also you need to have people that want to learn, right? Like hiring people that are growth mindset. I don't know if you would agree with that, John, but—

John: Well, well, part of it is everybody has different personality traits, [00:42:00] and the personality traits have to be matched to the job. This goes into the hiring system. It's not enough to just bring in somebody with skills. Actually, it's easier to train and teach skills than it is to change personalities. One of the personality traits is curiosity. Hmm. Some people are just seeking out new things to learn and some people don't care.

They—you know, some of those traits are good for some jobs, and some of those traits are good for other jobs. I'm a curious person. I love to learn. I hate to do the same thing over and over and over again. So I'm more of the big-picture, creative kind of person, and I'm a lousy detail person. So you don't want me to be your bookkeeper.

I'm gonna be like, well, how can we do it this way? Let's do it this way this month. We did that last month. I'm bored of that. Let's do, you know. Um, there are some jobs—but that's not a good trait for that job. 

Athena: [00:43:00] That—that's a, that's a good point, right? Like a curious person being on something that needs to be monotonous and the same every day.

Um, so I'm curious, your philosophy on hiring—um, you know, how do you measure for personality during the hiring process? I ask selfishly because we are hiring a bunch of people, but also I know that's one of the first things you typically need to do as a new owner. You know, some people might leave. You need to hire or you realize that you're not gonna be able to do everything the owner does, and you need to hire for a role. Maybe you don't even know what they're doing, but somehow you need to hire for it and manage for it, right? 

John: There's a lot of technical, uh, skill that you may not ever need as an owner, uh, particularly based on the kind of company. Uh, but you need to hire people who do that. And again, it goes back to Output Thinking. You can think about: if somebody does this well, [00:44:00] what's the output that I will see? Well, the refrigerator works well. I don't need to know how to repair the refrigerator, but I need to know how it gets repaired, what it means that it works, how long it should take, what it should cost.

And if I can find somebody that can do that, then they have the skill that I need. Um, there is, uh, one of the personality—there's a million personality tests and things out there. Um, I'm not a—I've not used many of them and I know a lot of them—the science doesn't really hold up. Uh, there's one called Culture Index that a lot of people that I know really like that.

Um, it tends to match people with—you know, are they the kind of person who would be good at sales, for example, good at management or things like that. Um, there's others, I'm sure, that are good. So that's—none of those things are, [00:45:00] um, you know, a hundred percent: push this button and this person will fit or won't fit. But they are things that you might take into account as well. But you have to match that with the job. So you have to know what kind of person fits this particular job. And basically that means what are the outputs that I need that person to produce. 

Athena: Yeah. We, we, um, we're starting to like, uh, adapt the hiring process per role too mm-hmm—to the kind of—so like pressure testing the ones that are gonna be under like, immense pressure. And it is really interesting to see how they react, and they show like, okay, you're not gonna operate well in a high-pressure, high-ambiguity environment because you're already melting down during the interview process. You know, just like giving 'em a project and giving 'em—

Luke: Yeah. 

Athena: You know, we think it's a long deadline to have like five days, but other people are like, ah. Um, so it's like, okay, well if that's a problem for [00:46:00] you, you're definitely not gonna be okay here. Um, anyways, I'm, I'm feeding in, but I think I saw Steve unmuting with a question.

Steve: Hey John, thanks for joining. Um, I had a quick question about—let's say you go and take over a business, and I would imagine you're in your field, you, uh, work with a lot of folks that buy businesses and there is no real playbooks or documented processes. So my question is, from your experience, if you're in that situation, are you better off doing the observation yourself and creating the playbooks or maybe hiring a business process analyst or somebody to kind of shadow everybody and kind of put, uh, an objective playbook together from what they see? And is that even helpful?

John: Well, first of all, [00:47:00] you'll never get it all complete. So don't—don't think you're gonna just go in, you know, for a month or hire somebody for a month and they're gonna document your whole company. Not gonna happen. It's a work in progress. So start with the ones that you need.

So if there's ones that are in crisis—somebody's not doing a good job, or, you know, somebody's going to leave—get their stuff documented. Um, it's a different kind of skill to document what somebody does. And part of it depends on what they are doing. And there's three kinds of documentation. These are called, uh, SOPs, Standard Operating Procedures, and how you document those—there's three kinds.

One is what I call a recipe—in deference to grandma perhaps—where it's a step by step: okay, you do this, you do that, you do the other thing. Anything that you do on a computer can be documented with a recipe kind of thing. And it usually should be done by video. So get 'em to do what they're doing, talk about what they're doing: I'm clicking over here so that this box opens up, then videotape that. Um, [00:48:00] that's also useful when somebody's working on a machine, so you can video it with a phone or working on some kind of physical device and have them talk through.

And then sometimes you take that recording and have it transcribed and it becomes your document. But the video is also useful. And those are things that are an algorithm—step by step: What happens if this? You do that. If that, you do the other thing.

The second kind is what I call a dance. This is usually when there's another person involved—so a sales conversation or a customer service conversation. You can't tell somebody exactly what to say, word for word, how to make a sale or how to handle a customer complaint. They'll sound like robots and it'll go terribly. What you can document though is what does a successful outcome look like? How do you know when you're ready to move on?

So a successful customer service interaction [00:49:00] generally means you fix the person's problem and they're happy—not just that they fixed it, but that they're, you know, you've helped them emotionally to get over it. Um, so in a sales process, in an extended sales process, there might be several calls before you're ready to move on to the next step. So the output of this step might be: you know the names of all the players involved, you know who's the decision maker, you know what the budget is, you know what their timeframe is.

I can't tell you step by step how you get that information. But I can tell you if you don't know those three things, you are not ready to move on to the next step. So that's defining the output, but not necessarily all the transformational steps that go into it.

The third thing is a creation where I don't even know what the output would look like. So I'm hiring a graphic designer and I want a new logo. [00:50:00] If I knew what the logo would look like, I wouldn't need you, you know. Um, but I do know the constraints—meaning I know my logo needs to have my company colors, I know there's a certain mood I want it to give. Is this a playful thing? Is this a serious thing? Is this—you know, how do you want that to be? And there's certain file formats that this logo needs to be in. Does it need to look good in color and black and white? So those are the constraints. Within that—go to town. So depending on what you're documenting, it will be documented in one of those three ways.

I don't know if that answered your question, but— 

Steve: More than answered my question. So probably gave me like four more questions, but yeah. 

Athena: Carry on, Steve, if you have more questions.

Steve: No, no, no, no. Um, yeah, I get my—I'm a little ADD so like, you don't wanna do the same thing over and over again. My mind goes as you're [00:51:00] speaking and, you know, so, uh, you mentioned about: go for—um, let's say maybe there's an employee that, you know, may be taking off—document that first. I was kind of curious—you spoke of, uh, some real fun stories at the beginning. Have you ever come across situations when people buy a business—and I'm asking this because we and Athena, and I don't know Peter—you know, we were—Paul and I were looking at a, a, uh, franchise business that has a lot of SOPs in place already.

Have you ever come across and—and how, you know, when you have something like that, you're bound to certain SOPs. Uh, have you seen that in a positive or a negative light just from your experience? 

John: Well, the benefit of a franchise is somebody has figured it out and somebody has written up how to do [00:52:00] it.

That doesn't replace the ability to deal with people. And you will be hiring people. People will have to be the ones that you have, you know, take those on and actually accomplish that work. So there is going to be some level of dance and some level of people skills that are required to manage people and to deal with those Ps.

You know, um, Steve, if you and I were to open up a burger business, we could probably make a better hamburger than McDonald's—

Steve: You're pretty sure you can.

John: —you know. Um, but if we just had, uh, John and Steve's Burgers, I don't think we'd get as many people walking in the door as if we opened up a McDonald's franchise the first day, because people wouldn't know what to expect. And, you know, we would then have to figure out how do we market this? And there's probably SOPs about how you do that and all that kind of stuff. So, um, yeah, the [00:53:00] SOPs of a franchise that's successful are really gonna be useful.

Athena: Successful is kind of the key one there. It was an interesting one that we looked at kind of as a learning exercise, but the franchisor themselves was selling three locations—one of which was doing extremely well—and he’s moving the location 10 minutes down the road mid-sale. Uh, and then the other two locations were a third of the revenue of the other one that was two thirds of the revenue that was moving away. And we were all like, why is he a franchisor if like all three aren't performing incredibly well?

So it was an interesting conundrum, right? And he's saying he doesn't have enough time to work with the fran—or to focus on the franchisees, and yet his locations weren't the model, you know, star performers. So do—what are your feelings—well, [00:54:00] I guess you said your feelings on franchises: you know, it can be good to have a working SOP, but the people skills. So that is something I don't think is talked about enough, because you can put someone into one of the best businesses in the world, and then if they're not good at people skills—and I wanna start swearing, but y'all know where I'm going with that—they're gonna ruin that business.

Right. So what do you think are the people skills or things that folks can be doing in preparation for taking over a business? Are there courses or books? I think that's one of the hardest things about running a business is the people. And yet, where do you start or how do you prepare for that?

John: Well, first of all, it helps if you like people. [laughs]

You know, it helps if you come at it [00:55:00] understanding that not everybody's the same as you and that people have—and if you're curious about what makes people tick. And, you know, there's people that work for you, there's people that you sell to. Even if you sell to large organizations—big companies, universities, hospitals, whatever—there's people in that buying process that are making decisions for their own reasons.

There are customers who buy for their own reasons. There are employees. Hiring an employee is, to some degree, a sales job. They work for you for certain reasons, and it's not just money. And so you wanna find somebody who fits—with their motivation—with what you can provide. Vendors are people, so they're gonna—you know, you’re gonna buy from them. You want somebody that you, uh, you trust and that you know works well. So it's all about people, but [00:56:00] not every job needs people.

Um, I'm thinking of a guy who runs a very successful property management company, and his market is small mom-and-pop investors who have 2, 3, 4 houses that they rent. And so there's two parts to this guy's business basically. One is to maintain the properties—so when there's an issue, they call a contractor to get things fixed—and then when there's a vacancy, they lease the properties. So the sales component to that.

And what he found was the people who are good at managing the maintenance are not so good at doing the leasing and the selling, and vice versa. And so he divvied it up that way and has different people doing different parts of it. And that's true with a lot of businesses. The people who can do the technical stuff aren't always better at dealing with the customers and/or the people involved. So you gotta match people together like that. 

Athena: I, [00:57:00] I saw Peter have an emotional reaction that people are not just working for money. Peter, you—it seemed like you had a, some sort of epiphany or reaction there?

Peter: Not an epiphany, just a reaction. I mean, yeah, that's a—I mean, I wish it was different. That's not what my reaction was.

John: As entrepreneurs, we are motivated by money. And salespeople generally are motivated by money, but other people are not. Once assuming they have enough money. You know, it's—so people—often entrepreneurs think, well, I'll just give them a bonus, I'll just give them more money. And that, you know—and some people it's like, no, that's not gonna do it for me, you know. Um, they don't always say it that way, but yeah. So you have to find out what motivates them. The good news is if you can motivate people in ways that don't cost money, you can make more money.

And if that motivates you, great. You know, I'm not saying you should just go out and screw everybody, but, [00:58:00] like I said, people have to have enough money to where other things motivate them. 

Athena: Right. Well, I mean, you know, we ask people why they left their last role in every hiring conversation they have. And I don't think I've ever heard anyone say, 'cause they didn't earn enough money. 

John: Yeah. 

Athena: You know, it's like they were upset about something, they weren't feeling valued. They didn't like being micromanaged. They didn't like the environment. They were remote and then being called back to the office, you know. It was like—I can't think of a single person. And Onca does more of the upfront, so she might have more, but I can't think of a single person that ever named money as the reason why they left, you know? Yeah. Um, that's interesting. Okay, so step one: like people. Step two: are there books or things—yeah, there is—there's a whole—

John: Resources—

Athena: —that you love for people to—okay, I like people, but I still maybe suck at managing people 'cause I haven't had a lot of experience or I wasn't given the right [00:59:00] toolkit. Amazingly, corporate America never teaches people—we weren't taught in school how to be a manager and a leader, right. So it's, you know, it's not—even if you're naturally a leader, it doesn't mean you're a good manager. So having, you know—right. Where do you start to start to prepare to be a good people person? 

John: And actually, even if you don't like people, you can learn some of the skills of dealing with them. And, you know, like I don't—selling is not my thing. I don't love the sales aspect, but I've built several companies and I've had to be the one out there knocking on doors, selling. I can do it.

Yeah. You know, um, there's a topic called, um, EQ—Emotional Quotient—like it's the counterpoint to IQ. It's not the Intelligent Quotient, it's the Emotional Quotient. And there are several skills in—if you read books or videos [01:00:00] about EQ—that tell you how to get better at that emotional quotient.

And the first book that came out about it that kind of coined that term, he said: in researching successful people, the technical ability was table stakes. They all were good at that. But the ones that did really well also had emotional skills. And part of that is getting your own emotions in check and knowing about yourself so that you're not reacting out of your emotions.

You don't want to squash your emotions—you wanna feel them. And emotions can tell you often interesting things to consider. But you want to act with your brain, and you want to act from a more rational place or a more controlled place. So, uh, yeah, I would encourage people to read [01:01:00] or do research, do videos on, uh, EQ.

Athena: Uh, do you also recommend people to get a therapist while they work with you? Like that good tag team on the emotional side of things? 

John: That's definitely—I’m a big fan of therapy. Been there, done that, and, you know, it keeps happening. Um, I don't necessarily say that everybody—I’m not in a position to tell people when they need to do that. Uh, sometimes I can recommend it, you know, 'cause it's pretty obvious. Um.

But yeah, it's—you wanna know who you are, you wanna know what motivates you. Um, I had a distinction early on in the coaching world 'cause when coaching became a thing, you know, there were life coaches as well as business coaches and people were saying, well, what are coaches—therapists? Are they this or are [01:02:00] they that? And when I was president of the International Coach Federation, it was a big topic of what we were doing.

And where I came out on it was: look, therapy has a whole different set of training than coaching. Coaching is about getting you into action. Therapy can be about figuring out why you feel this certain way. And that's valuable. And it's valuable to know where those emotions come from. Coaching is about what you do about that. 

Athena: Yeah, I agree. I mean, I use both personally, you know? Mm-hmm. I had therapy this week and realized that one of my concerns about a candidate that we're looking at was rooted in my own insecurity about something, you know? Um, so like, we are humans and fallible and have all of these things, but like, you know, it's like, okay, well now I understand that. Now I can act on [01:03:00] it. And the coach is like, push, you know? Or advisors are like, push, like, let's go. But, you know, and identifying where there might be challenges or roadblocks, but a bias towards action. 

John: I—oh, sorry. Go ahead. Before you get onto that, um, I can tell you one technique that I actually learned in, uh, marriage counseling, which is a technique called mirroring. Whereas when somebody says something rather than respond, you say, here's what I think you're saying. And you mirror back—you repeat back—what you heard and then you say, is there more?

And they will either say, no, you didn't hear anything I said. I meant this. Or they might say, yeah, you got it. Or they might say, well, yeah, you got it, but there's this other thing that I didn't say that I really wanna say. And you keep mirroring them [01:04:00] and not saying anything you wanna say until you really hear them and they really feel heard.

And then you can say, well, can I tell you my piece? And, you know, maybe that's the right time—and can you mirror me back? Um, so that is a very useful skill with dealing with people, especially when people are upset.

There's another one that plays into customer service people, uh, and I learned this from a guy named Tim Gallwey, who wrote a book called The Inner Game of Tennis. He started out as a tennis coach and got people—rather than saying, here's how you stand and here's how you hold the racket and you do all this boring stuff—he just got people hitting the ball right away. And it was like, oh my God, how do you do that? And he parlayed that concept into business work and stuff.

And he was saying—he was working with customer [01:05:00] service people—often when somebody's on the phone with them, they're very upset, they're very emotional, and it's hard for the customer service people not to feel attacked and not to get, you know, hung up in that—you know, well, I'm getting back at you, buddy; what are you doing here; did you turn the machine off and turn it back on again, stupid—whatever, you know.

And so what he told them to do was just write down on a piece of paper the intensity of this person's emotion from one to 10. How intense are they feeling? And doing that makes you detach from the engagement and makes you kind of step back and go, wait a minute, what's going on here? And that's a very useful skill in dealing with people, particularly when they're upset. 

Athena: What do you do when they're at like a nine or a 10? Like how—like how does writing it—how does writing it down connect to what to do next? 

John: Writing it makes you [01:06:00] feel less attacked. So you don't feel like they're attacking you. It helps you go, wow, that person's really out there, you know, which is very different than feeling like you have to respond at their level.

What I always tell customer service people to do is to say two things. One is, I'm so sorry that happened. What can I do to help? And you want them to be heard, so you may wanna mirror back to them what they're complaining about.

And your job as a customer service person is to say, I'm so sorry that happened—not to defend it, not to say, well, that's our policy and that's because we did blah, blah, blah, you know. And then if you say, what can I do to help? Once they've calmed down, you may be surprised at what they want would make them feel better.

It may be way more insignificant than you thought, [01:07:00] and that's not saying you can do it—you know, I'd like you to give me a brand new car and a full refund. Um, I'll have to take that up with my manager and see if that's possible. You know, it doesn't mean you can do it, you're just saying, what would make you happy?

And if you don't know that, you're going to obviously suggest something that might not even make them happy. Right. And I was talking with a client on this the other day. This guy came out of a background where he was very collaborative with his vendors and his customers, and so there was a lot of scientific research involved and they respected that research and whatever. And he bought a company a couple years ago where there's a new person in charge of basically getting better prices from their vendors. And he went back to them with all the rationale of why he's charging this price or whatever.

And he was like shocked that they were not [01:08:00] respectful of his analysis. And we were talking about it, and I said, you know, I don't know from your recounting of the conversation—I don't know what they want. He goes, well, yeah, I was just assuming that they wanted it more, and they—well, did they ask for anything? And he goes, well, I don't know. And he was just so miffed that they didn't respect his analysis piece. And I'm saying, well, okay. So we came up with a plan of action, and this plan of action is to call the guy back and say, you know, maybe I didn't hear you right. I don't know what you want to do next. I wanna make you happy. What would make you happy?

And get away from the fact that he was feeling disrespected because they didn't like his analysis piece, and say, okay, what can I do for you? We are a valued customer. We've been working with you for 30 years. We'd like to keep the relationship going. What [01:09:00] works on your end? And he wasn't even clear about what that was. And I don't think the other person actually said what that was. And so that's—it's really just about that kind of thing: getting clear on what are we talking about here? 

Athena: Yeah. Asking those questions. It's so interesting 'cause, uh, I think we talked about this at the event, but like we use a lot of relationship analogies here, right? Yeah. Like where you are at in the relationship with a seller. Like the first call, it's basically a blind date, and the only output is like, do we want to go on a second date? You know, if we have that kind of time. So, um, you know, and then the relationship escalates and, you know, things get real. We're outta the honeymoon period. We have to start negotiating things, you know. Um, so the—like, [01:10:00] the tools in therapy or relationships or the things that make the people around us happy typically can be brought into the workplace.

But, you know, it's so sterilized in corporate environments and stuff. And I think that's one of the beauties of being an entrepreneur is that we can decide the kind of culture and heart and, you know, sensitivity that we wanna deal with things—but at the same time, not being, uh, railroaded by people.

I—back when I was a business consultant, I had to help a founder who was very conservative, and somehow I had let a whole bunch of liberal employees into his company and didn't set any sort of boundaries around what was acceptable. And they were essentially bullying him for, you know, being a, uh, like cis white male—like things like that were actually like on the calls and stuff like that.

And so it was like this, this whole thing of like, how do you [01:11:00] negotiate that? 'Cause he still cared about his employees, but it's unacceptable to bully anyone in the company—founder, whatever—based on political ideologies and that sort of thing. So it's an interesting conundrum to have. I don't know how I got from relationships to that.

Um, if anyone else has any questions, like by all means, um, don't let me hog the mic. I do know, um, two folks that are gonna be rewatching it. I wanted to put some scenarios in front of you. Hypothetical. Um, got one client who just signed an LOI. Um, the owner is, uh, in late eighties, um, and has a relative, um, grandson in the business who is extremely overpaid, but does a, a, a role within the business. So she's like, I don't even know how to begin to start thinking about that. I mean, gonna have to replace this person, renegotiate comp. Like what do you do in those situations where you [01:12:00] know the new owner has a person in the business that—like the previous working relationship is no longer gonna work under the new ownership. Maybe they have some utility, but how do you keep them motivated if you're gonna completely change their comp or reduce it? 

John: Yeah, that—that's a tough one. Um, I would wanna know what is the market rate of somebody doing similar work. So how much are they being overpaid? Mm-hmm. Um, I assume this is not something that you can talk to the seller about. You have to deal with this after the fact. But, you know, in a family business often that is really a combination of: we're paying you to do a job and we're also giving you a gift of all this money that happens to come in your paycheck, you know, and we're doing this because you're part of the family or whatever.

Uh, the new owner's gonna need [01:13:00] to at least mentally separate those two things, and then at some point have a frank conversation and decide if they want to keep that situation going. And they probably don't because it's gonna affect other people in the company. It's gonna—people are gonna know. It's not like you can really keep somebody's salary a secret. 

Athena: Is that something you would address right away? Or like—my feelings, and, um, you know, this isn't necessarily right or wrong, that's why I was—I was curious your take on it—is you kind of wanna like, observe it and know why it's there first, like you said, before we start removing or changing comp. Because you know, one of the things I said to her was like, maybe this guy hasn't been able to change a lot. You know, the owner is just like, no, let's keep things the same. Maybe he has a lot of really great ideas and would justify that kind of payment if he were allowed to do that. We just [01:14:00] don't know yet 'cause we haven't met him. But, um, I imagine you'd—you'd wanna observe them for a while before going in and rocking a boat with changing the comp or, you know, getting rid of 'em.

John: Yeah. And, and have a conversation at some point about what that person's career goals are. Um, and you—you had a—you said something a minute ago: whether this is right or wrong. There's very few things that are right or wrong in business. Obviously there's certain things that are wrong, you know, but usually it's a question of: is this useful or not useful?

And whether it's useful to demote this person or change their comp or whatever—a lot of it depends on how much money the new owner has and how much cash there is and what that morale—how that morale is affecting other people by this person being overpaid or not doing as good a job. Um, I actually worked with a company and one of the things we [01:15:00] determined was there was a woman who was not doing a very good job and was severely overpaid, and we made that recommendation to the owner of the business.

And what she ended up doing was saying she knew that was the case. And she ended up—instead of demoting her or letting her go—she actually promoted her to another position that was commensurate with what she was being paid, and it was a better fit for her in terms of skills. And it worked out. Um, so it just really depends on the situation.

Athena: Yeah. I suspect based on the comp structure she was telling me—I won't share it here—but the business won't be able to sustain that and loan payments. Right.

John: Well then, then she has to be honest. She has to be honest [01:16:00] and say, look, this is not gonna work for me. Um, you know, here's things you do well, here’s what we'd like to keep you doing, but [we] can't do it on these terms. I'm not—I'm pretty sure—I, again, I don't know the situation. I don't think I would have that conversation till way after closing. 

Athena: Yeah, of course. I have another client who's under LOI, um, and there's five family member owners that will all be leaving the business eventually. Um, so, um—and it's a multi-location business, uh, distribution kind of company. Um, two of the owners are willing to stay on, but some of them are just, you know, retired, but equity holders and that sort of thing. So, um, how do you go into something like that where, you know, a big part of the leadership team are potentially gonna leave? And actually, we were looking at another business like that for some clients where a lot of [01:17:00] the—it's multiple owners; they're the leaders; they wanna leave. Would you even—

Well, some of them are staying in one client's instance. The other is like, they wanna leave after the transition period. So how do you think about that when there's a whole layer of kind of like knowledge and leadership that might potentially be leaving? 

John: You go back to—you know, if this is grandma in the kitchen—get those recipes out of her head and put it in a document. Um, and you figure out how do you replace people. Uh, there's a great book—there's two great books on hiring. One is called Who. 

Athena: I love that one. 

Luke: Yeah. 

John: Uh, Street and Smart—although instead of Street Smarts, they're Smart and Street. I don't know why they did it that way. Um, and the other one is called, uh, Hire With Your Head. And that's a new one. Hire With Your Head is more geared toward [01:18:00] hiring people—hiring managers—in large organizations. But you'll be able to filter that out and, um, you know—and what he says is, hire people who have done that exact thing before, but hire them into a role that's better for them. Um, that's the short answer of it.

I'm actually—actually on a coaching call tomorrow with a woman who eight weeks—six, eight weeks ago bought a company. Uh, two sellers—I think it was a father and son—and there's an older one and a younger one. And the father had a plan, you know: I'm gonna stay for this many months and leave. And the younger one was gonna stay for a long time and just found out that the younger one wants to leave quicker, has a health condition. And she—so she's like, oh, can we change the topic of our call tomorrow? You know, and it's gonna be: okay, figure out what this person does. How do you replace the outputs that they're producing? What can you do to make the transition as easy as [01:19:00] possible for the both of you?

Um, and, you know, it's frightening. It's scary. It can feel, uh, you know, personally affronting—I don't think that's her case—but, um, yeah, you know that going in. And there’s, um, big changes you have to make. But you might—in the case where there's five people leaving all reasonably at the same time—you might need to get a good recruiter in who can [work] for those kinds of things. 

Athena: Do you know good recruiters or how—like I've—I have not had the best of luck myself, which is why I ask. 

John: Yeah. It's, um—what a good recruiter does is, first of all, usually they're specialized in certain either industries or levels within a company. So somebody who can bring in a good VP of Marketing, you know, is not gonna be a good VP of Plumbing, you know. Okay. [01:20:00] But what a good recruiter does is they have relationships with people throughout their career so that when you have an opening, they can call somebody who's not looking for a job.

And that person—because of their relationship—will take their call. And that person, the recruiter, will be able to say: look, I think you might be interested in making this jump. Um, I don't know how you find that person if you don't know them or—you know, just ask around and get relationships, but ask those kinds of questions about that kind of thing. 

Athena: Yeah, it's a good point. The specialization, either in industry or level. It's interesting—I lived in London for 10 years and you only can get a job through recruiters, you know. And the recruiters that I made relationships [with] are still friends to this day. And they would call me up when I was in a job that they placed me in, like, hey, you know. Right. Um, but they [01:21:00] specialize in either marketing or events or, you know.

Um, and I just didn't find that when I came back to the US. I haven't seen it. If it exists, it's a shame too 'cause it's a really great model. It was a little frustrating at first because I didn't have those relationships. So the recruiters will often act as the gatekeepers 'cause they have their clients that they're very protective of and they only want to put like fit A-players in front of 'em.

Um, it's interesting. Yeah. The good ones are—yeah. I'll look into that and see if, uh, if I can find any there—if not, good business idea. 

John: And higher up in organizations, it's not necessarily about the industry, although it can be. Mm-hmm. But you see this in public companies, uh, where the CEO of something totally unrelated will do a good job in another company, because running a company of that size and scale can be, uh, very similar. Although in some companies it's not. You know, you get a bean counter in [01:22:00] charge of a car company and it doesn't work. 

Athena: Yeah, that makes sense. Well, um, so much gold, John, and I appreciate you answering those specific questions too. I know, um, both the folks I mentioned are gonna be watching the replay, so I imagine when they get to the stage, you'll get some, uh, some, um, reach-outs. And Peter also—I don't know if you saw the message—Peter is, yeah, in a business that he bought, looking to buy a second one. So it sounds like he's gonna be reaching out to you too.

So really appreciate this—such good food for thought, things to think about going into it. Um, we will put your details, uh, in the replay as well. 

John: If it's appropriate, I can put my email and stuff up on the slide. Um, yeah, so—and I really appreciate you having me. This has been fun. And, um, so. Please email me. I, I love to hear from people. I'll answer any questions. You can buy my book if you haven't already. And, uh, if [01:23:00] you wanna look into After The Close, um, be happy to help with anything like that. 

Athena: Yeah, such a cool service and, uh, not, um, something that's—that's available but very much needed. So we'll make sure that we put that on the resources, uh, dashboard that all of our clients have access to as well.

So thank you so much for putting this together, for spending your time with us. 

John: Thanks for having me so much. Really enjoyed it. 

Athena: Learned a lot. Thank you. 

John: Thank you for being here. Take care everybody. 

Athena: Thanks so much, John. We'll talk to you soon. 

John: Okay. Bye-bye. 

Athena: Bye.
