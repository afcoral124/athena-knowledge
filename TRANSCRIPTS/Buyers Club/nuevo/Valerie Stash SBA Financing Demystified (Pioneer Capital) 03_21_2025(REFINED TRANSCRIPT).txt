Purpose: Buyers Club session on SBA acquisition financing process and working with a broker

---

Athena (AcquiMatch): Well, I'm excited to hear the update. I haven't heard, but I know Justin just did a solar meeting. Yeah, actually probably did two deals under offer.

So got some exciting stuff. So all for joining us today. Um, we're so excited to have Valerie. Uh, we've been working closely with Valerie and Mathias. Um, well, Valerie recently, she joined the team. I'm sure she'll tell us about all that. But Mathias from Pioneer Capital. As an SBA broker and one of the most well regarded voices in this space has a ton of experience, um, from working as a, uh, an SBA lender and then has been a broker and helping folks like yourself to actually get deals over the line.

Um, they actually helped Lindsay and Kevin, um, close on their first deal. So using a broker has its unique advantages, but also Valerie, uh, has a experience from that lens too. So we asked them to come today to kind of talk you all through, um, some of the things you should be aware of as a first time buyer, the things they see catch people out and what it's like to work with the broker versus going directly.

Um, so we talked about some different things, but Valerie is going to wow us with her magic in terms of what she actually takes us through. And then as always. Um, and I'll start off with some questions, but if you all have any questions, this is your opportunity. Uh, so just throw up your hands, um, or drop stuff into the chat and I'll make sure that we facilitate those questions too.

So, uh, without further ado, Valerie, thank you so much for being here. We're super excited. We were able to have you on. I know you're just a wealth of amazing knowledge, but also the way you guys have optimized this, uh, process for people is really exceptional. So I'm excited to, to hear about that and all the insights that you have today.

So thank you so much for being

Valerie (Pioneer Capital Advisory): here. Well, thanks Athena for the warm welcome and, and nice to meet you all. I'm, I'm really excited to be here. Did share. I'm a little bit nervous, um, presenting because I don't know why, because who doesn't get nervous presenting for the first time? But you know, I'm just going to let it be and you guys are going to be kind to me and let me share, um, what we do here at Pioneer Capital Advisory.

Um, so yeah, I, as Athena shared, um, I'm new with Pioneer Capital. I started, um, back in December of last year, but I'm not new to the SBA space at all. I've been, um, in SBA lending for almost 10 years now. Um, my primary, um, role was as an SBA loan closer. And, um, if you get SBA financing, that is going, you're going to become best friends with your SBA loan closer because there is, there's a lot that has to get done, um, throughout that process.

And so you build up a relationship and a rapport and, um, just my experience being a closer, you just learn what's what's needed and what's not needed. And, um, you know, how to get to the finish line as quick as possible. So, um, we've kind of taken my expertise on that side of it. Um, Mathias’s expertise and, and building business.

And we've created, um, something here that will, um, that helps business buyers like you guys, um, get through the entire process. So I've put together a little presentation. I'd like to share with you guys. Um, let me go ahead. Can everybody see my screen? Okay, so, um, I put together a presentation just kind of sharing, um, Pioneer Capital, and then also kind of going through is just some common stuff that, um, that buyers like you need to think about when we are, um, looking at an SBA loan.

Um, we'll talk about sources and uses, we'll talk about, uh, debt service coverage ratios, we'll talk about term sheets, and then just kind of basic stuff to know to keep in mind while you're, while you're working the deal. So I first wanted to introduce to you our team. Um, so we've kind of exploded in the last month to be perfectly honest with you for for for a while.

It was just Matthias. He started this back in 2022 and then he brought me on at the end of last year and then we've recently brought on a team to help make the process go as smooth as possible and, um, and kind of help guide you through every step of the SBA process. And so we've got Matthias here, he's the owner, um, and then we've got myself.

And I kind of run operations and to make sure, you know, everybody is, is doing what they need to do and then step in and help, um, help buyers like you with the brokering part of it. Um, that's probably my favorite part of the job, to be honest with you. Um, then we've got two sales representatives, Alvaro and Rafael.

So as we get leads in, they go ahead and talk them through our process and just kind of talk through their deal and help them, um, on the front end. Once, um, a client is ready to work with us. We have three—well, we have another underwriter that's starting on Monday—but currently we have Pablo and Fernanda and so they're taking information that we're obtaining and putting together a credit memo and I'll go into a little more in depth of what that looks like.

And then on the back end of it, we've got Alan and Jane who are there to kind of be that coordinator, um, in closing to get you through, um, the closing process and, and, um, get you the tools to get through closing quicker. So, um, we've got an amazing team, um, we're international. We like to say, um, our, our team members are in, um, Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, and Colombia.

And so, um, they all have, um. They're just kind people and are ready to serve and help everybody that we work with. So it's just been a great profile that we've had. So I'm going to go through our six step process really quick. So, um, when our sales team kind of, um, takes a call, um, what they're doing is talking about this process that we have here at Pioneer Capital.

Um, when a client decides to work with us, um, there are. We've created this step, this guide, so that everybody knows what to expect along the way. Um, so the first thing we're going to have you do is sign an engagement letter that has a non disclosure agreement in it. And the engagement letter just kind of, um, states that you're going to work with us throughout the process, exclusively for 45 days. Um, because we're putting so much time and effort into this. Um, you know, we want to know that you're dedicated to, to going through the steps with us. Um, and then the non disclosure agreement allows us to share information that you provide with us to the lenders that we're working with.

Um, once that's signed, we'll create a data room where you will upload the required documents needed to start kind of like our underwriting process. And in the next slide, I'll kind of go over what those items are needed. During that document submission time, our underwriter will be reaching out to you if they have any additional questions.

And just kind of staying on top of like, hey, when are you going to, you know, get us, we're still missing your personal financial statement or whatever it is. But that is a secure room that you have access to. And again, it will be shared with the lenders that we're working with. Once everything is received, um, our underwriters, so Pablo and Fernanda and our new underwriter Romero, who's starting on Monday, um, will start building a lender deck.

And so based off of our like experience working with the lenders, we know we can anticipate what kind of questions they're going to ask, what kind of things they want to know about the deal. And so we've created like a specialized. Um, credit memo that we've put together and it's got the sources and uses.

It's got information on your business plan. It's got information about you and your personal financial statements. Um, it's got the, uh, debt service coverage ratios, um, in there because they all want to see that. Um, and so we've pulled together this, this credit memo. And the reason behind the credit memo is we engage, we have a list, you know, a list of 30 lenders that we work with. More, more or less.

So when we provide them the information, we want them all to have the same information that we're presenting to them and, and to back up, we don't send this information out to 30 lenders. We're going to pick the right lenders that fit your, your deal profile. And so if we're sending this to 3 or 4 lenders, we want them all to be on the same playing field. We want them to all have the same sources and uses, um, the same history of the deal, the background information to make a decision. So by creating the lender deck, it allows them, um, to have all the, all the same information to be able to provide the same, I guess, um, guidance for terms of what we're looking for.

So, so we have the lender deck creation. Once that's completed, um, our, our credit analysts, our underwriter will then make kind of like, he'll start socializing the deal with lenders, um, and see who's interested in the deal. Each lender has their own credit box of what's important to them. Some of it, they want to see your post close liquidity.

Some of them, it's the debt service coverage ratios. Um, some of it's management. There's, there's several factors that come into what lenders we're going to pick. So once a lender decides, looks at our credit memo and says, Oh yeah, this looks like a great deal and a fit for me. We would then make the introduction to you and the lender. At that time, the lender is probably going to want to set up a phone call to discuss your deal and see, um, you know, just get to know you, maybe ask some additional questions. And then at that time, what they do is they go out to their, um, they decide that they want to issue you a term sheet.

So they're going to work internally with their credit manager and kind of get a. a soft approval, um, because the lenders that we work with do not like to give out a term sheet unless they're fully satisfied or like fully, um, um, confident that they can get it through underwriting. Does that make sense? So they, they want to make sure that if they're issuing a term sheet, this is going to get approved in underwriting. So that's one thing you can trust.

Um, so you're going to get then hopefully two to three to four different term sheets that you'll be able to review. Um, you'll then pick one of those and as, as we go through the presentation a little bit more, I'll kind of talk through different factors in picking the term sheet.

Um, you then go into underwriting at whatever lender you chose. Um, at that time, you're going to work kind of directly with the underwriter at the bank. Pioneer Capital is going to stay on the, um, the communication and we'll be able to dive in and help as needed. But for the most part, it makes the most sense for you to work directly with the underwriter because they're going to have, uh, have specific questions about financials and stuff that only you can answer. And so it doesn't make sense to have a middle person there.

But while you're in underwriting, um, our deal success coordinators will be creating a preliminary closing checklist. And so based off of the items that are in the term sheet, um, that are in your LOI and your SIM, just kind of information that we can gather. We're going to go ahead and pull together a closing checklist that you can start working on while you're in underwriting. The goal of this is that maybe you can start collecting, we can get 50 percent of the items before you actually get into closing. So that by the time you get to closing, we're like halfway done and you can get to get done with closing in 30 days or less.

Um, typically an SBA loan closing can last, you know, can go 45 to 60 days. So if we can shorten that to like 30 days. It's like amazing. So, um, what we'll do is we'll create that checklist, we'll schedule a call with you, and instead of weekly calls, most of the clients that I work with, they really enjoy having that, that weekly phone call, um, to just kind of go through the list, let me know where the status of everything is.

Um, I have one client that I'm working with where we started this in underwriting. And he's literally getting ready to close in like three weeks. Like, so it just, it expedited everything on, on the front end. So that's kind of what we do in a nutshell at, um, Pioneer. Um, we do not take any fee from you at all.

We get paid when the deal closes. By the lenders, um, all the lenders have discretionary funds that they, they sell their loans on the secondary market. And so they have a bucket of funds that they set aside to pay referral fees. And so, um, we have negotiated referral agreements with them and so then they pay us once the deal is closed.

So we're offering this entire service to you, um, guiding you through the process at no cost to you. And a lot of people ask, well, does this affect my interest rate? Or does this affect, you know, do I have to have these fees bundled up into my closing fees? And the answer is no. Um, your interest rate is going to be dependent on your deal strength and what that looks like.

Like, um, and it does not affect, um, you, it does affect the lender. Um, they, sometimes it comes out of their, their commission, but it doesn't have any, any effect on you. Are we good there? Right. So we talked about that intake checklist. Um, this is pretty, um, this gets us a good start of items that we need, um, to go ahead and build our credit deck.

So for the business that you're acquiring, um, we need three years of business tax returns. Um, keep in mind that because we've just passed the 2024 business tax return filing deadline—March 15th or so. Um, you want to be asking your seller about whether they filed their 2024 tax returns or if it's on extension to get copies of that.

Every lender that I've been working with has been asking, they've actually been asking since the end of January. What's going on with the 2024 tax returns? So make sure you're kind of keeping that in mind and, and, and asking that question. Um, you're going to want interim, interim balance sheets and income statements for the last two months, and then, um, complete monthly income statements for the prior year.

So these are things that once you're under LOI, um, the seller should willingly give to you. This is my understanding. Um, Personal stuff, we're going to want a personal financial statement. Um, a lot of lenders are going to look at what your personal liquidity looks like and what your post close liquidity looks like, um, based off of like how much you're putting for your down payment.

Um, they like to see bank statements to support the amounts that you're putting on the personal financial statement. So if you say you have 50,000 in your checking account, they just kind of want to see a month, you know, like a month of statements to show that, um, any K-1s if they're applicable, a copy of your most recent mortgage statement or HELOC statement if applicable, um, three years of personal tax returns.

Um, again, I know personal tax returns are not technically due until April 15th, um, but know that that could come up as a closing condition and closing if we, if you're closing after April 15th, they're going to want to see that. Um, a copy of your resume, because they want to see what your history, your management history is, um, on your resume, and then a copy of your credit report, and you can just go in and get, um, just a snippet of your, um, credit score, because that just helps them evaluate.

There's usually, um, minimums on what credit, credit scores can be. We also like to see a copy of the SIM, if applicable. I know not all deals have SIMs and that's totally fine. Um, we need to see a copy of the LOI and some people are already at the purchase agreement stage, so we can get that. We have a sources and uses chart and that includes a debt service coverage model in it.

And so that you'll go in and put in what your intended sources and uses are because we can't guess what that—you know best what you want those to be. So we're going to go ahead and have you fill that out and include the, the, um, plug in the numbers for the, for the model. And then we also have a credit intake question that's going to kind of help us do a little bit more evaluating of you and your deal.

Athena (AcquiMatch): Hey, Valerie, real quick. Do you explain what sources and uses are and what would be included in there?

Valerie (Pioneer Capital Advisory): Yeah, I actually have a screen coming up that we can talk about. Perfect. Okay. Sorry. I will no longer interrupt that. No, interrupt—interrupt all you want. Thank you. This is great. Okay. Um, and this is like, this is just some general information.

So, like I said, we'll get it. We'll dig into some of these a little bit further as we go through this presentation. So, the road to underwriting. A lot of people are like, okay, I've got the signed LOI—what does getting to underwriting look like? And then, you know, what are the timeframes we're looking at?

So, again. You're going to have that initial call. Um, then you're going to do the onboarding where you get all of those forms in. Um, and then once all of that is received, our credit analysts, they have about 24 to 48 hours. They're usually turning those credit decks pretty quick. Um, and then we're going to be looking at lenders and trying to find the best lender for you.

Um, once you've signed the term sheet and everything, that, that time really kind of leans on you. Um, most lenders, once you get into underwriting, are going to provide an additional list. Get ready for a list if you're, um, in SBA, um, because there's always a list. Um, so once, before you get into underwriting at a lot of these institutions, at these banks, they're going to have additional items that are needed.

And so they will, they will send that out to you. Um, and it's going to be dependent on how quickly you get those items to them. Um, so it can take seven days. It could take 30 days. It just really depends. Um, underwriting on average I'm seeing is about two to three weeks. And again, the, the sooner you can get things to them, the sooner they can get it done.

And I had one lender, like I blinked and they had the commitment letter and approval done. So, um, that was really, um, most of these guys that we work with seem to move pretty quickly once we get, get everything that's needed so that their underwriters can do their proper analysis and stuff. Um, if a deal is larger, like if you're doing any kind of pari passu loans or anything like that, those do tend to take a little bit longer.

Um, and, and in case you didn't know, pari passu is, um, like where you do an SBA loan combined with a conventional loan. And so we do have some lenders that will lend up to 8 million, and so that would be—the 5 million is the most SBA you can do. And then the rest of the amount would be in conventional financing.

Um, those kind of deals can take a little bit longer because they have to go through additional credit committees and stuff. Um, each lender that we work with has different approvals. Um, some of them, some of them have, depending on, depending on the size of the loan, they may just need to go to like a credit manager for approval.

Some of them actually have credit committees that they have to go through. So, you know, there are, um, those are just considerations to think about. So if you can be on top of it and get them what they need, then they're able to, to go ahead and get you through the process as quick as possible. So, um, why buyers work with Pioneer Capital Advisory, um, you know, we help you to navigate the SBA financing process.

So, um, what sets us apart is we could just, you know, send your application to everybody, but we don't. We take careful consideration to get you in front of lenders who, who match your credit needs. So that we're not wasting their time and we're not wasting your time and we, um, take a hands on approach to getting you through the entire process.

So you're not left, you know, standing at the altar by yourself. Like, we, we want to, we want to walk you through there and be your partner through it and have calls and, you know, um, and, and, um, I don't want you to hear have calls and feel like it's going to take you for an entire day. It could just be a quick 15 minute call or, or just a text message or an email, um, to help keep you on online.

And so, um, there's a lot of lenders out there in the space and you can certainly go out and find your own. Um, but we're here to help negotiate and find you the best rates. Like what's important to you, we can help find the lenders that match that. So, um, you may be wondering when Pioneer Capital gets involved in a deal.

And so typically we get involved with a deal, um, when the letter of intent is signed, or when the deal, when it's close to being signed. That's usually when our clients engage us. Um, if, if they're in early talks and they just want just like help with structuring a deal and stuff, um, we have, we have a route where we can go where you can sign like a pre-LOI engagement letter and we can kind of talk, we can get one of our underwriters on with you to talk through structure and, you know, how we can make this work, um, and then, you know, when you're ready and you're close, then we would sign the engagement letter and go through, um, go through the entire process.

But a lot of lenders that we work with don't really want to be introduced to you until you have that signed letter of intent because, um, because deals, you know, they go through cycles and, and you can have, you know, you can be ready to submit an LOI or the seller goes with someone else or whatever that looks like. So, you know, for everybody's time's sake, um, they typically go through, um, we wait until we get the signed LOI, or we know we're close to it. Uh, and I know there's a lot of words on that screen, so I know it's being recorded, so you can read through that.

Um, all right, let's talk sources and uses. Um, so this is, this is a big thing, um, because in sources and uses, um, you have your actual loan amount, and then you have the source of funds as far as like buyer cash or seller note and then like the total project cost. So let's kind of go through this a little bit. Hopefully you guys can see my screen clearly. But we typically, one of the sources, the use of funds is going to be the business purchase.

So for this example here, we have the business purchase at a million dollars. And that is going to be coming from your SBA 7(a) loan. Then there's typically a category for bank closing costs. Every lender that you work with is going to have bank closing costs and these are going to include stuff for their lender counsel. There's going to be due diligence searches they have to order. There's going to be different reports that they have to order.

So that's where all of those costs come into play. At the end of the day when they kind of reconcile the closing checklist. If they don't use all of those funds, they typically will roll them into working capital. Um, there is oftentimes working capital and a use in, um, the sources and uses and the working capital would be funds—permanent working capital—would be there to help you get established, you know, as you're starting your business. It gives you a buffer so that if you have revenue that needs to be coming in, you have permanent money in the bank that you can use.

Um, then there is like buyer attorney fees, buyer financial due diligence. This is all stuff. This is where, you know, Athena and her team, this is if you have fees out of there, this is where those fees can get wrapped into your SBA loan. So typically it's called like, it can just be buyer transaction fees. And so, um, so those can be accounted for here. We just have to have conversations. You know, as we put those in the sources and uses, like in your cash flow model, um, you know, that you have these transaction fees, um, sometimes, um, lenders will let you kind of apply that to towards like your, um, to your cash injection. So it can be deducted from the amount that, you know, say in this example, it has like 114,900.

Well, if you've already paid out, you know, 34,000 in fees, they can reduce that down. And so then it, they would adjust the sources and uses accordingly. So there—or they can reimburse you at closing as well. There, there's several different options here, but those fees can get tied into your, um, to your loan.

Um, and so here we have the total uses at 1,149,000. Um, the, and it, then we have it broken down here. So the 7(a) loan, they have 80%. Um, they're, they're valuing it at 80% and so they have a 10% seller note. And then 10 percent cash injection. Um, most, all SBA loans, I should say, if it's a business acquisition, there's going to be a minimum of 10 percent down that's going to need to happen.

So this is just one way where a lender might be only willing to lend up to 80 percent of it. Um, and then the other rest would come from the seller note and the buyer cash. So there's also another scenario that we can look at here. So the buyer cash can actually be split with a seller note if the seller note is on a two year standby. So that can count towards your equity injection.

So here we have the same closing costs, same amount. The 80 percent of the project is getting funded by the SBA note. So then we still have the 10 percent seller note and then we have the buyer only bringing in 5 percent and because they were able to talk the seller into doing just a a 5 percent on a two year standby, that reduces the amount of cash that the seller has to bring—or the buyer has to bring—to the table.

Any, any questions there or? I know we'll have questions later, but I just want to, I just want you to know that there's ways to be creative. Like if, if you want to reserve some of your, um, liquidity that you have, um, which lenders look at, they're going to look at how much cash do you have going in and how much cash are you going to have once the deal is closed and funded based off of how much you're putting into it.

So, um, if you need to like maybe preserve some of your liquidity, this is a good way to do that. If a, if a seller, um, is willing to do that, if you have a lender that will, um, will finance 90 percent of loan to value, um, then you could also do where you have buyer cash at 5 percent and a seller note at 5%, if they're willing to be on a two year standby, then it can count towards your equity injection.

That's the key thing is it needs to be on a two year standby and it needs to be followed with an eight-year amortization, um, and then it can count for your down payment. So those are, I, I think a lot of people already are always surprised when they hear that because they don't think of that as a way to, to have that, that equity injection.

Athena (AcquiMatch): We actually, uh, you haven't seen it, but we have a new model and we actually help folks with all of the tools available. So they'll be coming to you with a model that has all the debt service coverage ratio, the, um, you know, the, the different tools available, like, if they want to add a performance based note, if the past performance allows them to do that, um, we always are pushing for 5 percent equity injection and stuff like that.

So we definitely, by the time they come to you, they'll probably have something that should be like, okay, this is all going to work. Happy. We're always shooting for like, 1.5 on the DSCR. Um, and helping them think creatively out of the box by the time they get to you and that this new modeling spreadsheet, like, um, I'm like, I literally geeked out and was just like over the moon about it, but they'll have that when they come to you.

Valerie (Pioneer Capital Advisory): I love it. That's

Athena (AcquiMatch): gold. Yeah, I think, you

Valerie (Pioneer Capital Advisory): know, it just helps. You know, we're, it just, I think helps the buyer, you know, be more successful and it keeps the seller in with some skin in the game. So I think this is all, this is all really good. So going into debt service coverage ratios, this is a big thing and this is going to be a big factor in, um, like the kind of rates you get, um, with, with lenders.

Um, basically the poor, I'm probably going to say this wrong, like the poor, the, the debt service coverage ratio, probably the not as favorable interest rate you're going to get. So the SBA does have a minimum and it's 1.15. Um, a lot of lenders, like if you're looking at more favorable terms, like interest rate is a big thing for you.

Like you want to try to keep it like 1.3 or higher and like Athena said even if you do 1.5 or higher, that's going to be really beneficial to you because it's going to show that there's that room, um, that you're able to pay back that debt. Um, and, and, and lenders do look at that. That's one of the key things they look at.

I would say that the debt service coverage ratio, um, and I, I preach it because I feel like I'm dealing with it on every deal that I'm, I'm, I'm working on is pre and post close liquidity, um, big factors. Um, and so like, uh, on that liquidity piece of it, um, if you have. Investors that you want to come in and be equity investors in your in your, um, transaction. That's always acceptable as well. Um, to kind of help with that, that liquidity piece of it.

Management experience is really is really key too but, um, you know, having an understanding of those finances and like making sure you're getting current finances. You know, I have one client that I'm working with and and their debt coverage was great. Thank you. They got January and February numbers and it's declining and if it continues to decline, they're not going to be at their minimum that they need to be at. So really having an understanding of what that looks like and knowing the numbers and knowing the business you're buying is going to be really important.

So that's debt service coverage ratio. I'm not going to go too much into it. I—credit is not my background. I'm not going to try to lie. It is. I understand the basics of it, but, you know, if you guys want more in depth stuff, we can definitely talk more about it, but, um, you know, and in another forum.

Um, so, you know, like I said, we go through, um, we go through the process and we, we gather all this information and we get in front of lenders and I wanted to give you kind of an idea of like, okay, we get three term sheets. Like, how do we decide what we're going to do? So, um, I pulled a recent example, um, where we provided all the information to, um, to the, um, and we got three different term sheets, which is great.

And they all had different terms. And so the client and I talked through each one of them and then I'll share which one they ended up picking. But you know, the first one, the loan amounts are all a little bit different. So we've got a loan amount of 961,000, one that's 999,300. Um, one that is… So, the terms on here, we've got one interest rate that was prime plus 2.25. Another one that was, um, prime plus 2.25. And this one was, um, prime plus 2.5. So, so two that were same, one that was different.

Um, they're all 10 year terms. So SBA financing, um, if it's a, if it's a business acquisition, you're looking at a 10 year term. That's standard. It won't be less than that. It won't be more. If you have real estate within the transaction. Um, within your, your sources and uses and the real estate portion of it is more than 51 percent of your loan proceeds. You can actually get a 25 year term.

So, um, and, and beyond that, if it's like somewhere in there, they'll do a mixed amortization. So you could have like a 17 year term or a 14, depending on how heavy that real estate is. So, these are all 10 year terms, um, the sources and uses they all have, um, they all have some working capital in there.

This one, this one only had 50,000 in working capital. This one is 100,000. This one is 100,000. Um, that's another thing to keep in mind when you're, when you're, like, working on your sources and uses. Like, really think about how much working capital you're going to need and how you're going to justify it. Because when we were talking to these lenders, they were like, okay, well, can you tell me how you plan to use that working capital and what that looks like. So make sure you kind of have an understanding there.

Um, the one that the client ended up picking was this one right here. Because the, the terms were, were the same here. Um, and it wasn't even about the loan amount. It was that they had three months of interest only, and that was really attractive to the borrower because they were able then to like think through it, like, Oh, okay. If I just have interest, that can save me some money. I get up and get my feet running. Not all lenders do that. This lender happened to do that. So it was just a nice option. And so he decided to go with this one. And, and I even told the client, I was like, Hey, yeah, that's pretty attractive. I think I would go with that one. Um, that, you know, that seems like a good, good deal for me or for them.

So, um, so we had all great offers, all great lenders. Um, he wanted to know like our history with them, you know, like how many loans would we close with them, all that kind of stuff. So I was able to share all of that. Um, and he was able to make the final choice. So there's lots of different factors. Some people are very rate sensitive and we can get rates anywhere from, you know, fixed rates, um, like at prime plus 1.5 or, um, adjustable rates from, um, prime plus 2.25 all the way up to prime plus 3. So there's definitely a range that we can get of rates. And like I said, it depends on all of those other factors. Um, and how well the loan is collateralized, several different factors. But. That's how he, how we came to terms with this term sheet here.

Um, next thing, advice for you guys. So, um, I would suggest that you understand the SBA basics. So, um, this is one of the most popular programs that is backed by the U.S. Um, you know, it can be used for business acquisition, working capital, equipment, real estate, refinance. Um, and, you know, it's attractive to banks because, you know, they are able to, um, you know, have most of the loan guaranteed, at least 75%.

I would suggest that you prepare a very strong business plan, um, lenders and underwriters as they are looking at your deal, evaluating it, they're going to want to know what's your plan. How are you going to execute? Like, what does this look like? Um, what kind of projections do you have? What is your competition look like? Um, you know, your experience, your background, all of that should be in your business plan.

Um, it would be key that you know the loan requirements, um, you know, having a minimum credit score, what that looks like. Most banks want to see 650 or higher. Um, you should expect to put down 10 to 20 percent, whether that's just your own cash or, um, understanding personal and business financial statements, and also just kind of understanding that the SBA is required to take all available collateral.

So if you own a home and you have available collateral in it, there's a good chance that they might want to take your home as, as, um, as collateral on the loan. There are workarounds on that. Um, I would say go get a HELOC and don't draw on it just so that there's not available collateral. Um, and then also if you have outside source of income and you need liquidity, you could use that as towards your down payment as well. So, you know, know what's, what's allowable and what's not. Um, there's, there's definitely, you know, workarounds. And I don't want anybody to ever be surprised. Like, what? You have to take my home as collateral? Well, yeah, it, it clearly states it in the, the SOP, um, for the SBA.

Um, I would highly recommend that you always work with the SBA preferred lender. Um, there are thousands of lenders out there. They're not all preferred. Um, do your due diligence, look at the SBA website, look at the SBA rankings. Um, thankfully here at Pioneer, you know, we work with that top, top tier of SBA lenders that are all preferred. Um, cause you honestly get what you're—if someone's going to over promise you, they're definitely going to under deliver if they're not a preferred lender. So be mindful of that.

Um, I would suggest carefully evaluating the business you're buying. Um, you know, review those financials, check the cashflow, um, understand every aspect of it before you, you know, dive, dive deep into it. Um, be ready for due diligence. Um, the lenders are going to, like I said, we kind of went through that list. They're going to want all of the business tax returns, um, profit and loss statements. Lenders are also going to be doing business valuations. If you're purchasing commercial real estate, there's going to be appraisals and there is going to be environmental reports that are all needed, um, in order to close the loan.

Um, some other things that people don't really think about is when you're purchasing a business, if it has brick and mortar, think about the lease. Like, have you started negotiations with the lease? Have you talked to the lease—to the current landlord or has the seller notified the landlord, um, if they, you know, that they're selling the business? Will you be assuming that business or that lease agreement, you know, kind of keep that in the back of your head. Um, because those, you—I often see lease negotiations hold up deals. So, think about that. Um, because it's a requirement from the SBA. If you do have a location, it needs to be the term of the loan. Um, but with that said, there's some workarounds. So, you know, it could be, um, a five year lease with an additional extension to add to the 10 years, or, um, if you can explain to the lender that the, the location itself is not, um, not required for your business operations, like you could do it anywhere, then, you know, most lenders will let you have a lease shorter than the term of the loan.

So just keep all of those factors, um, in the back of your mind. Um, so consider a business broker/consultant, which you guys already are. You've got a great team here, um, that can help, you know, vet stuff for you. Um, same with a business debt broker like we are, um, you can have the help through the process instead of trying to do it on your own.

Um, I would suggest budgeting for additional costs. Um, and there's a great calculator. You can just Google SBA loan guaranty fee, and it'll pull up, you know, the spreadsheet where you can put in your loan amount and get an idea because you'll want to add those into your cash flow models. Um, consider, um, closing costs, the lender fees. Again, we talked about working capital. Consider all of those fees because they're going to be important.

And then the last one is just be patient and persistent. Um, it's not, you know, this process can take 60 to 90 days. Um, ideally when you're working with team members like, like we offer and with like, with Athena's team, um, the goal is to get you through that process faster, but sometimes it takes a little bit of patience, um, to, to get there.

Um, and then finally, final thoughts, um, just because you're going through the process and one lender says, no, it doesn't mean it's not a good deal. Like some lenders. It's really dependent on their own credit box and what that looks like because, um, we definitely—like I like to explain as we're talking to people about the lenders we work with. We have some very conservative lenders that are like, it has to meet every single bullet point that is on their list. And then we have some lenders that are like, middle of the row. And then we have some that are just like, I call them like, they're wild, wild west. They'll, they'll kind of just, yeah, just throw it at me. Sure, they don't got no liquidity. We'll take a look at it. You know, like they're, they're more open. You're going to pay the higher interest rate. But, you know, it doesn't mean it's not a good deal. It just means we have to find the right lender who's going to work it.

Um, again, I'm going to reiterate, be patient. This, this process can take a long time, but it's so worth it in the end. You know, I find so much joy and fulfillment—when I was an SBA loan closer, um, one of the, the… Like, I laugh because my, my friends and I like that—I work with my colleagues. Um, every time we closed a deal, we had like this DJ air horn that we would play. Um, and when we were in the office pre-COVID, you know, like, we'd be all working and then we'd hear like the—you know, cause we were like all super excited that we closed the loan because it's such a satisfying process. And we, I heard so many stories of, you know, how this is going to change someone's life.

And, um, you know, for their family and for the better. And so that was just really satisfying. And so. Again, it's, it's a process and if you're patient through it, it'll, it'll, it'll pay off in the end. One key advice, pick an M&A attorney that know the market. Um, they know what's needed for SBA. Um, they're going to guide you. Like we have suggestions. I'm sure Athena’s has suggestions. Like that is really crucial. Um, I had—I was working on one transaction—this was like probably six years ago and um, you know, they hired like an entertainment attorney or something and like this guy doesn't know what he's doing so let's, you know, like just be mindful of that because um having the right players in your, in your, um, dugout is really going to make a difference and then trust your gut.

You know, if something doesn't feel right about your deal, doesn't feel right about your lender, doesn't feel right about one of your advisors, trust your gut because that's going to just guide you in the right direction. So that's all I got for you. I hope you guys got something out of that.

Athena (AcquiMatch): Awesome Valerie, thank you so much for going through all of that. Um, I think there's reiterations of of key points that we talk about enough and a lot and then there's like, good considerations that hadn't been brought up before. Um, I think that last point of not only an M&A attorney, but one that's familiar with SBA processes, um, because, you know, we hear it all the time.

It's like, oh, my local lawyer has done acquisitions and it's like, but have they done SBA small business acquisitions? Right? Because it's a whole different ballgame because you're going to be dealing with the. The lender’s lawyer as well as the seller’s lawyer and making sure that those things all cover SBA guidelines.

So these, these lawyers that understand and have been through this process are more likely to set up something that the SBA and the lender is going to be happy with. Also.

Valerie (Pioneer Capital Advisory): Absolutely. Yeah. And because, you know, all the lenders have their own, um, legal counsel representative and it's usually outside counsel and there's a big space of, of, um, you know, um, legal counsel that, that represents banks and SBA and what they're doing is they're not reviewing the contract and saying, Oh, well, you need to negotiate this.

They're reviewing to make sure that your contract is SBA compliant. And so if you're already working with an attorney that understands SBA and what's needed, they're going to make sure you're staying compliant with what's needed. A lot of this, a lot of the list, a lot of the rules is all about staying compliant because banks are trying to protect their guaranty. And so—or, yeah, their guaranty in case the deal goes into repurchase.

Athena (AcquiMatch): Right so, um, to that end. Um, what do you see folks get wrong where they, like, end up losing, uh, an opportunity or they can't get any term sheets or after commitment letter, it falls apart. And it's it's on the buyer. Like, what do you see buyers getting wrong?

Valerie (Pioneer Capital Advisory): Um,

Athena (AcquiMatch): that's a great—want to give specific examples without revealing who it is, if that helps too.

Valerie (Pioneer Capital Advisory): Yeah, that's a great question. I think, I think I go back to like doing that due diligence and not really understanding the seller’s financials and, and, and being able to explain what they're able to see because as the underwriter starts digging into things, um, they might start calling out and they're like, well, why are these ad backs here?

Why, why is this information here? And if you can't justify it and it doesn't end up going, I think that can really tear it, tear up a deal pretty quickly. Um, you know, not disclosing—you know, I know this sounds silly, but I had a deal recently where, um, finding out one of the guarantors, um, had a bankruptcy recent, and that—there's nothing, you know, that can be worked around, but this particular lender, um, if it was within 7 years, they, they couldn't do anything with it, so they had to restructure their deal.

So, just kind of being a little bit, you know, mindful of stuff like that. Um, a lot of it is just that due diligence on the front end. I had another deal that kind of blew up. Um, it was in the space of, um, like the medical wellness, and, you know, I don't know if you guys have heard like the, the compounded, you know, Ozempic shots and all that kind of stuff.

And, um, there were just recent regulations that happened where, um, that was going to affect how they ran their business and marketing. So I think understanding, you know, again, regulations around your—the business that you're purchasing and what could be potential downfalls if certain regulations come out and could affect your business.

Athena (AcquiMatch): Yeah, great. Really great points. Um, so just to clarify, you know, there's, there's no cost to the buyer to use you. It's not going to make their loan more expensive, et cetera. So they're going to get somebody that's been through a million times and going to help them through it. And also what I like about brokers is that you're kind of a buffer between.

Like the buyer and the lender. So if they're like, oh, this came up, I'm a little scared. How do we handle this? You know, it's like yet another advisor that's been through this a million times that they can talk through some of the challenging stuff with you. You did mention a deposit. So I just want to clear up.

So in case anybody is not, you know, none of these folks have been through us before—that deposit isn’t to you; it’s lender‑asked for. Can you just explain what that is and whether they get it back?

Valerie (Pioneer Capital Advisory): Yeah. And just to, um, just to confirm, yeah, we do not take any fee from you at all. Um, we, like we get paid from the lender after the deal closes and it has, like I said, zero effect on your interest rate or your transaction fees or anything there.

Um, the deposit—so lenders that we work with, um, once you sign a term sheet are typically going to want some kind of deposit. And I've seen it range, honestly, anywhere from 2,500 to 10,000. And the reason why they collect that deposit is in case they want to get third party reports ordered and they would always ask you first before spending that money.

But also by you giving that money to them and—like everybody, if you have to give up 5,000, you're going to kind of see how it—you’re going to have skin in the game and you're going to want to like, you're going to like see how this goes. Um, it kind of takes the deal off the plate of other lenders, because you've kind of committed, you've softly committed to them.

Once a deal is, um, through underwriting and you get a commitment letter, they, they often have an additional like deposit that they want you to make. And it could come to like, maybe the total deposit is 10,000 and at term sheet, they had you deposit 2,500. And then once you get the commitment letter, you're going to provide another 7,500.

Now, don't think that that 10,000 is just gone. It's going to get applied to your buyer's equity injection. So if you owe 150,000 in equity injection, they're going to take that 10,000 you already deposited and count it, take it down your equity, your equity requirements. So then at closing, you're going to only have to bring in 140.

That money is typically 100 percent refundable if they didn't spend it on any reports. So if you're going through the closing process or the underwriting process and the deal is not good or they're not able to, um, you know, issue you a commitment letter. They will refund that money to you. So it's, it's more there of like a security, like they're covering them if they get into it, order reports, and also you're then committing to them because you've put money on the table. That help answer—

Athena (AcquiMatch): super helpful. Um, and, you know, so folks know, because we're always like, never, ever the broker, you know, it's a little bit different with the lender. This is normal. And it's refundable if they didn't spend that money in any way, which you'll know about before they do it.

So, um, we highly, strongly recommend everybody get a QoE as part of their process. We love Chris—actually met him through Mathias. Um, so, you know. Always thinking about, you know, what's the way to, like, go through this process and spend the least amount of money and kind of know if a deal is viable. So we say, you know, at least term sheets, but, you know, maybe even getting your commitment letter before you order the QoE. Are you doing that simultaneously? Like, what's your thoughts on timing around that?

Valerie (Pioneer Capital Advisory): So I see, I don't know that I have an exact timing. I see a lot of people waiting, you know, until the term sheet is signed or even—while it's in underwriting—that they kick the QoE off, you know, depending on when the timing is. That's typical of like when I see that happening.

Um, just so that if any red flags come up, um, you know right away and so then if you're in underwriting and you get—like Chris is like, guys, this is not a good deal, or whatever—you’re getting that red flag before you get even further down the line or down the aisle. That's, that's—

Athena (AcquiMatch): yeah, that's when we tell folks to do it too. After term sheets, get that started. So, um, great. And then so, uh. There's no cost, but you do ask for exclusivity. So that is a little bit different than going direct to lender. Um, but it is because you guys put so much into this process and you're creating that deck and you're going out and finding those term sheets for someone.

Um, so. Anything more to say on that in terms of like, you know, lenders versus working with you. What are you seeing? And, you know, comparisons.

Valerie (Pioneer Capital Advisory): Yeah, so we, you know, like, Mathias and I really thought a lot about the exclusivity because we didn't want to turn anybody away. Um, but we've invested, um, in hiring team members to help people get along the way. Um, and you know, because we don't get a fee from you guys, or, you know, we're not asking for a fee, we don't get paid till the very end of it. Um, we want to make sure that you guys are in it to work with us.

And, um, we kind of got stuck in a few sticky situations where we had put in all of this time and effort and even gotten to where we were in underwriting and found out that the client was shopping the deal and had it out there and, you know, pulled out from under. And so again, it's all of that time and effort that we put into it and we love doing it. We just want to know that, that our clients are, are wanting to work with us and understand and see the value in it.

Um, you can absolutely go out to, to lenders yourself. You're going to find, um, they might not be as responsive. Um, they, they may, um, you know, again, they're going to want exclusivity too. They're not going to want you out there shopping the deal. Um, we even have some lenders we work with that, like, if, if they know we're putting this out to several different lenders, they're going to be like, yeah, hey Val, I think we're good. We don't, we don't necessarily, you know, want to look at this deal and we respect that. But most of the lenders we know, know that we're trying to get the best terms for our clients. So they understand that we're going to be shopping this out to three or four different lenders.

Um, you know, and again, just not knowing, knowing who you're working with. Um, as far—we, we built up these relationships, [with] the lenders. I will tell you, I have like a gazillion text messages, um, like group messages with the lenders and myself and Matthias, you know, just like constantly advocating and, um, you know, following up and checking on stuff for our clients. And you know, part of that too is, you know, with our experience, um, when you get into stuff like underwriting or closing—not so much underwriting, but more on the closing side—I’ve been able to be an advocate for our clients because I've been a closer at a bank.

I know exactly what's needed and what's not and what can be negotiated. So, you know, sometimes if the bank closer sends out a closing checklist, and I'm reviewing it and I'm like, that's silly. We don't need that. Or, okay, we can work around this or like talking about the lease negotiations. Like there's always stuff to work around. And if you're working just with the bank closer or the lender, they might not give you those tidbits, but I've been able to advocate for our clients and say, for instance, business personal property is one of the major insurances that is needed on most SBA loans. Um, but I had several deals where they were, um… In the digital services realms, they didn't have like an actual location. They didn't have any actual business assets and the bank was still requiring it. And I just went back and kind of like fought for our client. And I was like, this is stupid. I—sorry, I was using like simple terms here, but like, okay, this is dumb. Why are we making them, you know, get an insurance that is actually not needed?

And so kind of negotiated with the lender and the closer at the bank, they were able to go to their management and get it waived. Um, if I didn't bring that point up to our client, he would have just had an extra expense of buying this business personal property that made no sense.

So. You know, like I've—I'm confident in those skills that I have and just my knowledge and understanding and my team having that knowledge and understanding to be able to kind of red flag some of those things or, you know, um, be able to preemptively, you know, like, kind of help on the front end to get some of that stuff taken care of.

And also, when you're working with just a lender directly, you're not going to get a preliminary closing checklist to start working on things to get through the closing stage faster. Um, I have a client right now that is trying to close his loan by like April 8th, and he's still in underwriting. So we are actively working on his pre‑closing checklist, because he's going out of the country on April 9th. So, like, there's just certain factors that we can help you with that you wouldn't necessarily have if you were doing it on your own.

Athena (AcquiMatch): Yeah. And I think it's up front too—going and getting, uh, term sheets from different lenders on your own. They're all asking for different things. And it's like, well, what's necessary right now. And, um, you know, we try to help on our end, but like, with, with the existing relationships that you have in the process that you have, somebody is only giving you information once and then you go and do that kind of work and remove kind of maybe some headache there in terms of what they're asking for.

Now they're coming back and like whether the term sheets are reasonable and the requests are reasonable. So—

Valerie (Pioneer Capital Advisory): another good point to add too is you can go out to all these lenders and I bet all of you guys could get term sheets like with various lenders, right? But who can actually deliver on those term sheets? And so we have a very high, um, rate of conversion that if one of the lenders we work with issues a term sheet, they are, like I said, a hundred percent confident that they can get it through underwriting.

You can get term sheets out there, but can you actually get it through underwriting is a whole, you know, um, question,

Athena (AcquiMatch): right? Um, so something that I think it's good to kind of, like, hammer home is the difference between a term sheet and a commitment letter and what the writing actually means. Right? So, like, in—and I like simple terms. So don't apologize for using that because I think it helps.

This is very complex. And a lot of times people are using a lot of jargon and it's like, I don't know. Actually, I know what this means. And there's different names for term sheets. You know, there's a—there’s for commitment letters. So you just very basically explain term sheet, underwriting, commitment letter. Like, what does that actually mean? At what point do you get excited? At what point is like, this is high probability of going through.

Valerie (Pioneer Capital Advisory): So I like to look at the term sheet as, um, kind of a proposal. Like, so, so the bank has, um, has the lender at the bank and I, I, I know I kind of use lender/bank like interchangeable—like the lender is the actual person that we're working with at the bank. And then we've got the bank. Um, and lender is, you know, like… I know that name is entertaining. It's just hard. It's jargon.

But anyway, so the lender has reviewed everything in your file and has said, gosh, I really like this. I want to put a ring on it. So they're gonna, they're gonna put a ring on it, but you're not actually married until you get the commitment letter. Right. So your, your lender is going to offer you the term sheet, which is your proposal—so your ring—and then you're going to go through the underwriting process. And the underwriting process is going to do a little bit more digging. And they're going to put together their own lender credit deck.

And so they're going to put together this credit memo. And I've worked at three SBA lending institutions, and all of them have had different credit memos. Um, the first one that I worked at had credit memos that were like 50 pages long and then, um, most recently, the last one I worked at had credit memos that were like 15 pages long. So they're all going to do, they're all going to look for and, um, look for different stuff. They're going to ask you additional questions. They're going to take the credit memo we created and add in information into theirs. They're going to do additional due diligence and analysis, market research.

Um, they're probably going to pull soft score. They're going to pull your full—they're going to do your hard credit check. They're going to do, um, initial due diligence searches just on, you know, current UCC filings, just making sure you're not a criminal or, you know, anything like that. They kind of do their own investigating and searches there. Um, so they're kind of just building the case for you to get married. And so once that case is built, that's when it goes for additional approval with either like credit manager or goes to credit committee.

If it goes to credit committee, um, the lender is defending the deal on your behalf and saying, Hey, this is why I think we should do this deal. It has all of these strengths. They've got great management experience. The debt service coverage ratio is great. And they're going to, they're going to sell it. So, um, so then once they get that stamp of approval, they're going to issue a commitment letter and that's you at the altar saying your vows. So like that is official, you know, that's it.

Um, so those are, that's the difference between the term sheet and the commitment letter. Um, you should get excited when you get a term sheet. You should get excited when you get three or four term sheets. You should get excited when you pick which one you want to work with, um, but you can really kind of, um, maybe take a sigh of relief once you get the commitment letter. Does that help kind of explain it a little bit?

Athena (AcquiMatch): Yeah, I love that you're using marriage analogies to acquisition matchmaking like this. Everything is about relationships and there's so many throughputs. So you guys are seeing that here.

So it sounds like, you know, there's proposal, but then—I think everyone apart from some of my team members has been married. Right? You have a ton that you have to do when you're, you're getting married. You have to, yeah, find the venue, you have to compare all the vendors, you have to get your budget together, and you have to go through that whole process with each other, like, do you still want to get married? You know, so it's like, all of those things that you're doing to get to the actual altar is the underwriting process is the way I would look at it, you know, so—

Valerie (Pioneer Capital Advisory): correct.

Athena (AcquiMatch): Um, so that that's great. Folks, if anyone has any questions, you know, throw your hands up—team or clients. Um, Valerie's clearly got a ton of experience and understanding of this. So, if you have any specific questions to you, it looks like Steve, you've got your—you're waving your hand, but you use the thing or all trying to be kind to me.

Steve (Buyer): So, no, no, thanks for joining. I was on a plane earlier today, and I was connected to Wi‑Fi. So everything's all messed up. So I can't find how to get my hand up on Zoom. So it's everything's a mess. Uh, hey, thanks for joining today—love, uh, you know, leaning on your experience. You mentioned about like putting your home up for collateral. That's what sometimes they'll do. I've just—and this is maybe a silly question, but let's say it's a 10 year SBA loan. Three years in, we want to sell our home and move somewhere else. What happens?

Valerie (Pioneer Capital Advisory): That's a great question. And what you have to do is actually work with your—work with the servicing department at whatever SBA lender you're at. And so what they're going to do is they're going to, um, submit a servicing action with the SBA. And they are going to then work on, um, releasing that collateral.

What they would do then typically is if you need some of those funds to go towards your down payment of your next home, then they would, you know, allow that transaction to happen. And then they would—my understanding, I'm not on the servicing side of it, so, you know, forgive me—but my understanding is then they would then get in the next lien position for whatever house that you're, you're purchasing. So you have to kind of get permission from—you would want to reach out to your lender, get permission from, um, the servicing department to move forward. Cause again, they've got to do all these servicing actions with the SBA. And if you're—if, if you get to a point and you've paid down your loan enough and they don't need that additional collateral, they may just release it as well.

Steve (Buyer): Okay. Another twist on real estate. So let's say you don't own a home at the time that you're applying for the SBA loan. Do you put up like a bond? Do you put up extra, you know, stocks? What do you, what do you do? What do you see?

Valerie (Pioneer Capital Advisory): No, what they would, um, typically, um, the, the, the next form of collateral that they, they look at is life insurance. They'll, they'll have you get a life insurance policy, um, for usually the full amount of the loan. And you could be—it could be an existing life insurance policy that you have already, or you can go out and get a new one. We work with, we work with an amazing team that can turn SBA, um, you know, life insurance policies like within 24 to 48 hours. Um, so oftentimes if you're under‑collateralized, most banks will want you to have a life insurance policy in place.

And so the life insurance policy kind of works the same way. Um, so you have a million dollar loan. Um, and, uh, that whole million dollars is assigned to the lender. Um, five years down the loan, unfortunately you become deceased. Um, that loan—that million dollar collateral assignment—they would only use what is needed to pay off the loan and then the rest of it would go to your beneficiaries. So it's not like, you know, it's gone then, like, they're not going to make a profit off of you dying. So. Yeah, but that's how they, that's how they kind of handle that collateral shortfall.

Steve (Buyer): It seems to me—maybe I'm off base here—but it seems to me in that situation that they're better off if you're dead. So then if you—your business goes out, is that there's no collateral on that. So I'm just trying to understand the collateralization, but I know—yeah, that's just,

Valerie (Pioneer Capital Advisory): that's the one way they've mitigated, um, is adding the life insurance policy. And in certain states too, um, you know, like if you're in Texas, there's a homestead law, so they won't, they won't take your home as collateral. Um, oftentimes too, though, you gotta think about if you have rental properties and stuff, and if there's available collateral, they will take that. I have one client right now that they have like—they had, I think, six rental properties and four of them had available collateral, so they took the four as additional, um, you know, uh, as additional collateral on the loan.

Athena (AcquiMatch): Thank you. On that point, Valerie, the HELOC that you mentioned, and Steve, these are great questions, and Valerie's not a lender, so we can speak candidly, hopefully, about this HELOC play, because I've heard different things about it. So, you know, obviously getting a HELOC, not drawing down on it before, then there's no equity for them to take, but does that affect their view of you as a borrower—post‑close liquidity, that sort of thing—like does it impact your ability to get a loan if you've, you know, taken out that HELOC. If not, it feels like everyone before they go for a loan should be getting a HELOC so you can—

Valerie (Pioneer Capital Advisory): Yeah, that's a great—we really recommend it. Like, if you don't want a chance of your, your home being taken as collateral, pull the HELOC on it. Don't draw on it because, you know, you want to just show that you have it available. Um, and it doesn't hurt your, your own personal, um, you know, debt service. Um, that's really a good play because a lot of lenders, it actually adds more work to them to add a third lien onto your home. So if they see that you have a first and a second already, they're going to be like, eh, why, why even bother? And I even have clients who have taken out HELOCs on their rental properties just to avoid, you know, having, having that, um, taken.

With that said, I will add this caveat. There are, there are still some lenders who will take your home as collateral. Because they can. And so they, they will, they will still kind of take that reach and put a third lien on it if they feel like they need to. So I think it's a great play. It's a great way to get around that, but also know that it's not a hundred percent foolproof because some lenders just are like, Hey, if it's there, we're going to take it. So, um, just know that. And that could be off of their own credit policies.

Because one thing you have to think about too is. Banks have to follow what the SOP says, the Standard Operating Procedure for the SBA. That SOP for the SBA has a lot of gray area in it. So lenders also have their own bank policy in place. And so the bank policy sometimes will supersede what the SOP says, or if there's that gray area, they will fill in based off of their own bank policy of how they're going to proceed. And that includes what kind of credits they're going to look at, how they're going to make a determination on what's needed in closing. Um, all of that comes into play. And so you kind of—they kind of have those two competing factors of, of approving and working with an SBA.

Athena (AcquiMatch): Got it. Cool. Um, great overview, and it sounds like everyone should be—anyone with a home or rental property—should be running out and getting HELOCs right now, if you haven't already. Um, retirement accounts—can they come after those? I've never feel like I've gotten a firm answer on this.

Valerie (Pioneer Capital Advisory): That's a great question. I have never seen anybody take a retirement, um, as collateral and I've, I've closed a gazillion loans. Um, I've never seen anybody take it as collateral. Um, you know, I did have recently a situation where I had a group of buyers and they were buying a, a, a, a manufacturing business. And, um, the one principal guarantor did not have much liquidity, um, didn't own his home, you know, didn't have much just personally. Um, even though the group of buyers did.

What one lender proposed was, um, maybe taking a portion—like having the equity investors put in, you know, 200,000 into a CD that was going to be held at the actual lending institution. And then they would use that as kind of collateral for like two years, just to make sure that they didn't need it and they had it. And then after that, they would release it and that, that, that money would still be earning interest and all that kind of stuff. But it was a way for the lender to kind of protect their interest. Um, but still, you know, issue the loan. And the investment, you know, group was totally fine with that, understood it.

Um, so I've seen stuff like that where they might want to do, um, you know, maybe have a lien on, on like an account like that. But I haven't personally seen it on, you know, an actual retirement policy or like account.

Athena (AcquiMatch): Awesome. Um, Joe, was that you? That was unmuting. I thought I heard someone unmute to ask a question.

Ryan (Buyer): That was me.

Athena (AcquiMatch): Oh, okay. Sorry, Ryan.

Ryan (Buyer): Yeah, I wanted to jump back to what Steve was asking, which is, um, the life insurance policy versus the personal guarantee. What about interest rate wise? You know, do they look at—obviously it seems like the personal guarantee is more favorable. Does that, um, affect the rate that you might get if you're—

Valerie (Pioneer Capital Advisory): so I don't want to—so let me, let me jump back to the personal guarantee. So anybody who has 20 percent ownership or more on the loan is going to have to personally guarantee the loan. So, if you're, you know, like, if you, if you're building your ownership table and if it's more than just, you know, that—if someone has 20 percent more ownership, they're going to have to guarantee the loan. There's no way around that. That's an SBA rule.

Ryan (Buyer): Sure.

Valerie (Pioneer Capital Advisory): So, so there's that. Remind me what you had in your question.

Ryan (Buyer): So, like, let's say someone doesn't own a home, right? Yeah, we're just going to do the life insurance policy because they don't, they don't have the—they don't have, um… Is the rate that they're usually going to get offered, is that a higher rate?

Valerie (Pioneer Capital Advisory): Um, not necessarily, because if the deal is stronger, like, you know, it just—we have some lenders that have a sweet spot where if the deal is under‑collateralized, they're still fine and can, can offer, you know, prime plus 2 to prime plus 2.75, you know, it's—if the other—if there's other strengths to the deal, it being under‑collateralized shouldn't necessarily affect the interest rate. It can, it can, it can play a part in it, but, you know, um, if they can mitigate it in other ways, they'll do that. But yeah, it's, it's kind of a balance. They take a look at the whole picture. And if there's other strengths to it, we can still negotiate, you know, a better rate.

Ryan (Buyer): And then on the same note, kind of then what Athena was referencing is like. Will you be looked at differently if you have a HELOC already on your home and, you know, maybe they'll work with you, but do they—if they're a third lien—that the rate is still…

Valerie (Pioneer Capital Advisory): I wouldn't—what I wouldn't do is get your HELOC and draw on it and have a whole bunch of debt. If you have the HELOC and it's just sitting there, um, they're not gonna, they're not gonna look at it and say, Oh, why did you get a HELOC? Or why did you do that? You know, like, um, it's—most of the lenders know that that's a tool that, that clients are using and doing. So, you know, um, it's not going to be like looked down upon. I would be careful on how you spend it.

Um, and I would also kind of keep in mind too, like if you do want to use any of those funds towards your down payment, they are going to want to know that you have a spouse that can help with that debt service coverage. Like, they want to know that you have outside income that can cover that payment because they want to know that it's not going to affect your, your SBA loan payments. So they want to make sure that you're able to cover that debt outside of, you know, like—that there's outside income to pay for that HELOC.

Athena (AcquiMatch): Pulling debt to get debt—they don't like that. Right? But if you have the HELOC available, and you're not using it, then it's kind of cool because you have it available, but you're not using it. So you don't need it. But if you pull that, and you're trying to use that as your down payment, then, like, can you make all the payments? Yeah. Great questions. Ryan, did you have anything else? I had—I had two—

Ryan (Buyer): Yeah, I have another one. You know, what's interesting about what you guys do is that they know—that the lenders that you work with—they know you're shopping this, you know, deal to multiple people. And so it seems like, well, they know to kind of make the best offer because they know you guys may get another, a better offer.

So, um, my question is, is there any—because you guys do it that way—are they open for negotiation there? Because you can, you can be forthright and say, I have another term sheet. I like that you're not going to charge me interest for 3 months, but your rate’s a little bit high.

Valerie (Pioneer Capital Advisory): Yeah.

Ryan (Buyer): How does that work?

Valerie (Pioneer Capital Advisory): Yeah, that's a great question. So a couple of current examples. So, like, I have, I have one group—it was actually that manufacturing group—and we, we talked to three different lenders and they all issued term sheets. The last lender we were talking to, he's like—he asked them point blank. Like, hey, I know you guys are talking to other lenders. What, what's most important to you?

And the most important thing to them was that, um, they had to bring in less equity. Like for them, they wanted to preserve their cash. So, um, what that lender did was he worked up his term sheet and he was prime plus 2.75 and the other—I can tell you the other term sheets I had were less than that—but my buyers are looking at going with that, that last lender because he listened to what was important to them.

And so for everybody, it's going to be something different. Some people are going to be very rate sensitive—like, I want the best rate possible. Great. We'll help you find that. But some—it's like, Hey, if I don't have to bring as much to the table, then let's do that. I had another—same thing. They, they wanted to bring in as little equity as possible. And they were talking—this is a pari passu loan. And, um, I had one lender who was offering a fixed rate at prime plus 1.5 for three years. And, um, and I had another lender who was offering, um, two and a quarter, I think, plus prime. And they're leaning towards the two and a quarter because they can—their like reduction in what they have to bring to the table is like—so for them, that's what's important.

So what I'm always trying to find out from the clients is like, what's important to you—and the lenders as well. And so then I actually have another situation where, you know, we were getting term sheets in and we were working—we were waiting for one more with a lender. We're like, Hey, we've got two other term sheets and they're at this. Can you come at prime + 1.5%? He was able to talk to his management and get it. And so that—he can win the deal. So yeah, that's the thing that I, I think—that’s the part of my—like, I really love working with the clients, but like doing that, like wheeling and dealing and like, Hey, how, what, what, what can we do or what's important and really understanding, you know, to the buyer, what's important to them is, is going to be—cause in the long run, you know, maybe, you know, a quarter point or a half point isn't going to make that big a difference, but if they're, if they're being able to save some of their cash reserves—why not? Does that help answer your question?

Ryan (Buyer): That's great. Yes. Thank you.

Athena (AcquiMatch): These are great questions. I'm feeling like we need to have a part 2 with just a Q&A session with you because I know you got to go in 3 minutes. Steve. Do you have a quick one?

Steve (Buyer): I just got a quick one. Just—I thought of something. A lot of us—or several of us—on these calls with Athena and her group are, do have a W‑2 job as well as we're trying to transition from one rat race into another rat race. So, with that said, is there an advantage or a disadvantage from an SBA underwriter’s view of somebody who is transitioning like this, or it may—keep the W‑2 and, you know, operate as well?

Valerie (Pioneer Capital Advisory): So that's a great question. So we, we actually work with a lot of people who are transitioning from, you know, W‑2 to their own, you know, their own entrepreneurial, you know, um, feet, which is great. That's the whole point of this. Um, you know, we want to see people, you know, taking, taking advantage of that.

Um, and as far as like, does an underwriter—they might ask you, like, if you have someone who can manage the business, um, who is capable, um, you know, and you can still keep your W‑2, that's fine, because some people still want, like, that transition period to still have money coming in if they're not going to take, like, a large salary from their, their new business.

So that's not looked upon [negatively], but be ready for questions of how you plan to manage and operate that business if you're planning to keep your W‑2. Like, is your W‑2 in sales and you're flexible and you can, you know, do what you want? Or is this going to, um, is this going to like affect your business because you're not there operating it? And so having that management plan, explaining it in your business plan of what that's going to look like is going to be really key and really important.

Um, you know, that's, that's where a lot of these guys—they want to know you're going to be successful. And, you know, another thing to think about too, is like the seller consulting, like consulting agreements with the seller. Are they willing to stay on for three months? SBA requires that they can only stay on for a year, but you can have the seller stay on in a consulting role, um, to help kind of transition you and help you be successful throughout the way—throughout the process. So that's something to think about. But yeah, they're going to ask a lot about how you plan to manage and operate this business.

Another key thing to think about too is if you're looking at an opportunity—say you live in Texas, but the opportunity you're looking at is in Tennessee—are you planning to relocate? A lot of people, um, want you to live where your business is operating, unless it's a kind of a business where it doesn't matter where you operate and some of those closing conditions might be that you have to show a long‑term lease that you're going to rent a location or, you know, a transition to move because that's important. They want to see people that they're loaning money to actually operating the business that they're buying.

Athena (AcquiMatch): Such great—I know you have a hard stop now to get to your next thing. This is—

Valerie (Pioneer Capital Advisory): I have a few more minutes. If you guys—if you have more questions, yeah.

Athena (AcquiMatch): I feel like we should do a part two and just everybody write down all the questions and like, we can have you back. And I—

Valerie (Pioneer Capital Advisory): I hope that I've been able to answer what you—

Athena (AcquiMatch): but I think you don't give yourself enough credit because you, you have answers for every—this has been awesome. And, and, uh, you know, I'm, I'm learning a lot or getting confirmation or just like confidence in certain areas, which is great. And that's one of the reasons why I love the idea of working with a broker is like, you can ask all those questions that you might be afraid to ask directly to the lender.

Who's like, is it going to affect my situation here? And you guys have been through this backwards and forwards. I mean, decades of experience between you and Mathias, uh, and the team. So it's, it's fantastic. Um, we believe—

Valerie (Pioneer Capital Advisory): it's transparency too. Like we're, we're gonna, like, we're gonna be honest with you. It's not—you know, obviously we're in it to like earn a living as well, but we're gonna be honest with you of like, Hey, we think we can get this to, to, you know, a lender or not. And if not, we've had to have those hard conversations. And, you know, we've even gotten to a point where a buyer was in closing and we had to have a, like a hard talk with them and say, Hey, we don't really think you should move forward with this deal.

Even though we knew we lost out on all that revenue, like. It was not the best move for that client. And you know what happens—sometimes deals die like that, but you're going to, that—I feel like it just kind of means that you're going to have another opportunity. That is what you're really supposed to be, you know, um, going for. So don't take—you're going to have those kind of fall on your face moments or whatever. I don't know, whatever you want to call it. Um, I'm bad with analogies, um, but there—I just feel like that just means there's something else better out there for you.

Athena (AcquiMatch): I love that. And yeah, another reason why we're excited that you're in our world and, you know, available to support clients. We're very much of that mind too—like, we want people to be stepping into something they're going to be successful at, that's going to make them happy and, you know, set them up for success along the whole line. So you can never have enough good people in your corner advising you through this process.

Um, Valerie, appreciate your time and insight so much. I am gonna be writing you and finding out part two so we can have you back into it. Um, I, uh, really appreciate it. Thank you so much for your time and. Um, just a little reminder to everybody. We're actually going to be taking off next week from Buyers Club. We'll be back in another week. Um, but Valerie, thank you again. This is awesome. Um, we're going to be dropping Valerie and Mathias's Pioneer Capital details. So when you guys are at the stage that you want to have a conversation, all those details will be on the platform, uh, and in the replay.

So you can get in touch with them when you're ready. And we'll be pushing you to have a conversation with them too. So thank you again. Any final—

Valerie (Pioneer Capital Advisory): words before we sign off? No, good luck, you guys. This is an exciting time. You know, like I, I, I, you know, I come from a entrepreneurial background, like my, my, um, family and stuff, you know, they've all started businesses. And so this is really exciting. And, you know, I wish you guys the best of luck. Hang in there, find the right opportunity. Um, and, and, you know, it's, it's going to be life changing. You're going to have a great time. So thanks for letting me share a little bit about Pioneer Capital and also just meeting you all. So I look forward to hopefully working with you in the future.

Athena (AcquiMatch): Yeah, absolutely. Thanks, Valerie. Thanks, everyone. We'll see you later. Have a great weekend. Have a great spring break from Buyers Club and we'll see you again in, uh, like, March. I was going to say April, but yeah, whatever the next Tuesday is after next week's.

Thanks, Valerie. Thanks, everyone. See you later.

Ryan (Buyer): Thank you, Valerie.
