Anke: Hello. Hello. Welcome. Welcome.
Hey, Paul. Oh, Andrew's here. We've got Gil, Peter, and I know 

Wendy: some of these folks. 

Anke: Yeah, you probably 

Athena: know all of 'em. So, super excited for today's conversation. Uh, Wendy needs no introduction, but I'm gonna give her an introduction anyway, um, I found her. Actually through one of, uh, my good friends and, and very first clients in this business.
Um, and it was so funny 'cause they were like, he gotta meet Wendy. And I was like, yeah, yeah, whatever. I'm just sourcing deals. And they were like, she's gonna be in Austin. And I was like, uh, and I'll make a coffee. And then we went and met for a coffee and I was like, how have, where has this woman been all my life?
So, um, really, really love how she treats clients, uh, how she looks at deals, how she goes above [00:01:00] and beyond to help people through this process, particularly first time buyers. And what's uniquely special about Wendy as opposed to other lenders is that she's also a CPA. So she's able to analyze and look at deals and financials in a way that other folks aren't, which gives you just, you know, more insight into where.
Some of those warts might be hiding and how to overcome them. Uh, she works incredibly hard and has so much heart. Um, also has become a, a personal friend of mine too. So really excited to have her here to give you a behind the scenes. So I've asked her, uh, if I could ask her questions for you all to hear, like when, when you have an opportunity and you bring it to her.
What's the process actually look like from her end to take a deal, to get it ready, to put in front of the different folks that need to look at it, approve it, um, and what those, what that process looks like, and then where the hangups typically end up being so that you can be better prepared [00:02:00] when you have the deal in hand.
Um, because what a lot of folks don't realize is that it's not just the bank looking at the business. They are very much looking at you, right? And how you handle the process, how you present yourself, your relationship to the deal. Um, and so they have a lot of conversations about you throughout this process too.
So, um, without any further ado, I'd love to introduce Wendy Gormley at Live Oak Bank. Wendy, thank you so much for being here today. 

Wendy: You are welcome. Um, I know everybody here so well, I haven't met Gil yet, but I'm sure I will eventually, um, have a chance to talk to him a little bit more. But just, just so I understand what you guys are looking for, I think every one of you has kind of heard about what I tell you you need to do, but I think what you're asking is what do I see, what do I experience and what makes me wanna work a little harder for this customer versus maybe this one just gives me the feeling they're not ready yet.
Is that kind of where you're 

Athena: at? Yeah, we can start there. So like initial impression [00:03:00] and like what makes you want to push, you know, push a deal forward, but then also what does that process actually looks like? A lot of people don't know the behind the scenes and you know, it's like I bring you a deal and then we sign a loan.
So what, what is actually the process that you're going through? How many people are looking at this? What's that kind of approval process look like? Um, and then knowing all of that. Okay. I think give them context as to why you look at people differently about whether they're ready to go through that process with you.

Wendy: Okay. So, I was half tempted to just share this screen, but there's confidential information on it, so I won't do it. But I wanted to show you my files because I think if you saw those, you would see just list and list and list. And I could scroll for days on my, my buyer database. So, um, I have probably three people call per day that are new and even more email or come to me through the marketing channel.
Um, [00:04:00] I got, um, like, I was blessed to be hooked up with some, some big networking groups, um, across the US and, um, the, the, the buyer flow has been obscenely busy for the past two years. So for me before, I'm gonna spend too terribly much time working with anyone particular borrower. First and foremost, I'm looking at the personal financial statement.
Do they have the financial wherewithal to inject 10% equity on their own without depending on somebody else to help them? And I can, I can give you an entire presentation on why that's important at a later date. Second thing I'm looking at is their personal information form. Um, because I'm tracking to see if they've ever had any management experience or they've led any teams before.
Um, the SBA requires two years direct industry experience. It literally says that in the standard operating procedures, if you're buying a computer recycling distribution company, the odds of me finding somebody in that direct industry are pretty [00:05:00] slim. But I'm gonna have to find enough meat and potatoes in your resume to piece together why you are an adequate fit for this particular type of company.
So leadership's really important. Um, I, I do categorize my borrowers. Um, everybody does it a little bit differently here, but given, given the amount that we have to work with, everyone gets a ranking. I'll be very really honest with you. Some people are a's, some people are b's, a lot of people are C's, some people are D's, which generally my mind means do, do not advertise to.
So when I send my updates via email, they're not gonna get one from me because I don't want to trigger them to come back and ask a bunch of questions. Um, dealing with people that carry themselves well, that have a high level of emotional intelligence is really important to me. Um, SBA and a lot of other banks is a four letter word, not a three letter word.
Um, it's where you send loans to die live. Oak Bank is not a bank with an SBA department. We're an SBA bank, so we lead with that. For me to try to [00:06:00] switch to conventional is a whole lot more work, whereas in normal banks, having a conventional lender try to switch to SBA is more work. Um, so I'm trying to meet eligibility requirements immediately through your resume and your personal financial statement, but I'm also paying attention to how you handle yourself.
Um, I'm gonna be very candid here and hopefully you guys all take this from a state of grace. But if somebody bombs me with 15 emails on how to fill out a personal financial statement, you're probably gonna get moved to a D pretty quickly. There's lots of resources online that teach you how to fill out a personal financial statement.
You should pretty much be able to just follow the instructions and figure it out on your own as well. Right? There's this fair amount of financial acumen, um, that we would like to see in customers. Even if you, you are not a CPA, even if you've never managed a balance sheet and a profit loss statement before, you're gonna have, going to have to have enough financial acumen to adequately, um, review financial statements, apply some [00:07:00] critical thinking skills, and piece together enough of an idea of what's really happening with the company so that you yourself can go in and ask some of those critical questions without myself having to lead you all the way through the process.
Um, the other thing too, and this is not a sales pitch for Athena, but Athena's customers are ace. If you come to me from a valid, um, referral source who is qualifying their candidates before they get to, to, to me, I know that you're gonna be much easier to work with. So for me, it's all about are you easy to work with?
Do you have all your financials together? Do you have the ability to supply, apply some critical thinking skills to the deals that you're looking at without me having to spoonfeed you? And that tells me that you're gonna be somebody that could potentially take over a business and manage that transition fairly well.
So that's kind of how to get through the gate with me. Um, I think all of you know that my instructions are go to office hours, go hunting, find about three [00:08:00] deals that you're really interested in, come back to me with a model and we'll put it in my model and we'll de-risk it together. And then if there's one that really makes your heart sing and you wanna enter into LOI, just let me have an opportunity to look at it first and make sure it's something that we can stand behind.
And then I'll coach you through that because you don't wanna go and offer something to a seller, throw it on my desk, I run the cash flow and find out it doesn't work. Or we find other critical risk issues that haven't been de-risked and now I have to go back and do a retrade. It's really hard to unwind expectations with the seller once you've set them.
So that's kind of the starting point. Um, let me know if you have any questions from there. And then if you want, I can probably dive into some of the pieces during underwriting and closing. 

Athena: Yeah, I think that's, um, like really interesting to hear about the, the rating process. So how, you know, say somebody comes to you, they're an A at the, the beginning, how does that play into what comes next?
So let's, let's say that they've got a deal in [00:09:00] hand, looks like something that you would like to potentially lend on. Um, how much does that rating kind of factor into likelihood to close or get lending at that point? 

Wendy: That's a loaded question. Um, because I've had some a's self-sabotage and blow up their own deals during not only underwriting, but then also closing.
Yeah. Um, so if you come to me and I haven't heard from you a while and you send me an email, I'm gonna immediately pull you up in my CRM system, and then I'm gonna go to my files and I'm gonna look at your background and I'm gonna take a quick look at the CIM that you're sending over. Or if you just say something like, I've got a machine shop that just, all they do is splice and cut and then resell.
I'm gonna immediately pull up your profile. And if you came from, I'm trying to remember what this person's background was, but I think it was like fitness, product, sales and [00:10:00] like they had a small fitness marketing company. They did some product sell through Amazon and they were also a personal trainer that had like an online learning platform that, that they had done.
I, I'm gonna. I'm gonna look at that and I'm gonna say, okay, that's probably not gonna be a priority today. Do you, do you follow me on why that's not a priority today? 

Athena: The connection is, is not there. So had that person written a thoughtful email as to why they thought they were a good fit for this business and why that business was the one for them, along with it might that have, and they, they made some strong connections between their background interests, you know, maybe they grew up in a machine shop and that just wasn't in their, their background.
Exactly. 

Wendy: Exactly. Um, 

Athena: so that, that might change the game a little bit. If people are writing you a thoughtful email as to why they are interested in this deal and why they think they're the right person to buy this deal, [00:11:00] 

Wendy: that that can be more true. Um, I just recently introduced, um, I. Borrower that you introduced me to, to a gentleman that I had closed a loan for last year.
She's been striking out, she's been losing LOIs left and right. We get three quarters of the way through due diligence and then things just kind of fall apart. And, um, she was like, I don't know what to do. I need therapy. And I'm like, well, let me let you talk to just a few other folks that finally did close and they can tell you what they did and didn't do wrong.
Um, and, and this particular guy, I honestly didn't wanna pay attention to him when he first came to me. He came from a particular group that just infiltrated me and bombed me with buyers that were not qualified. And so I, you know, even though he had a nice resume, I kind of labeled him as such. Um, and, uh, this is probably the fourth deal he sent over.
But with this one, even though I couldn't quite make the connection between his background and, and the, the business he was buying, he kept coming back and he kept [00:12:00] writing. Really informative, uh, paragraphs about why he knew this business, why he wanted to, to buy this business. And then turns out it was really through his wife's experience, um, for five years working on a really well-known branded national, uh, account that we all know that, I can't say 'cause you'll probably piece together who this borrower is.
But, um, it was, it was through his persistence, his continuous, uh, education that he kept feeding me about why he knew he would be a fit for this. And then finally it was finding out that his, it was really his wife's background that gave him all this knowledge into this industry. And then I was like, okay, got it.
And then once, once that light bulb came on, we were off to the races and we were closed rather quickly. And, and so I, I guess not only to the point, to Athena's point where if you give me some context to work with, so I'm not sitting here having to extract it out of you, it's much [00:13:00] easier for me as a lender to like pick you up and run with you.
Um, so the other point to that is don't forget about your spouses. They may not be on the loan with you, but I have another instance that you know right now that's in closing. Um, in Albuquerque, the, the guy that's buying this company is really a little bit out of his bandwidth as far as the size of the company with the employee count.
He's never managed a team that large before. He's always been in charge of smaller projects with three and four people. Um, but his wife was an HR manager. She's seven years older than him. She's been with big time corporate entities for the past 15 years. So, you know, my, my concerns around. Do you really have what it takes to manage this many people?
Because you're not getting a qualified CFO in the transition. You don't have an HR person, you're gonna have to get all new insurance. You're gonna have to deal with benefits in this one particular state, which is really a difficult state to deal with. And then all of a sudden we're having coffee at the true foods one day and he starts talking about his wife.
And [00:14:00] I'm like, you should have led with that, you know, 

Anke: trusted advisor. Right. Like board meetings. Yeah. Every night at the dinner table with 

Wendy: Yeah, but like your COIs, your spouses, your family members. You know, you want to go buy a company that specializes in only marketing to desalination firms. And I'm looking here going, how does this match up with this?
And then I find out your entire family's been in desalination and plumbing for 45 years. Those little nuggets of threads that connect the deal are so important to just spit out on the front end. 

Athena: Well, so to let, let, let's, let's go a step further. Like, why is that actually important for somebody to have a connection to the business?
Because a lot of people think, oh, the, the bank's looking at whether the business is a good investment or not. So how much does the borrower factor into this? And what do, what do these folks need to know about the conversations that you all are having through this process about the borrower [00:15:00] themselves and why making that connection at the outset is important?

Wendy: Well, you gotta remember, we're managing transition. Anybody can read and manage cash flow, but we're managing the transition to the cash flow. Stay stable. And so, um, if you don't have any connection to the industry, 'cause we've already said that finding someone with direct industry experience is kind of like a needle in the haystack.
Um, so we have to piece it together to demonstrate to the SBA that we have exercised prudent lending. We also have to manage the transition. So if you're coming from an engineering background and your entire family's engineers and your wife is an engineer, and you come to me and you throw a CIM at me for a spa, if you have five producers and one of those producers has maternity leave for nine months, you've lost 20% of your revenue.
Who and how are you gonna backfill that position with that esthetician if you don't already have connections in that industry? I mean, you can't backfill employees if you don't already have a COI. In [00:16:00] that industry, you don't have anybody to rely on with the trials and tribulations of managing that type of person.
You have no idea how to adequately market a company like that. When things go bump in the night, you may not know how to manage the cash flow or provide adequate incentives to keep those people on on your staff. Considering a lot of estheticians are 10 99. So the industry experience and having a tie to industry is absolutely critical in every deal that we look at.

Athena: Right. Or being able to demonstrate how you have a connection to that industry. Or a really strong plan for how you're going to make that connection. Right, right. So this is, this is one of those things where I think, uh, I don't, I don't love investors on a lot of deals, but like, if, if you're going into an industry that you have no experience in potentially getting an investor in that has a ton of experience, then that gives some weight or at least finding those advisors that you can demonstrate to you.
It's like, well, I don't have this industry experience, but I have these advisors [00:17:00] around me that do that, that are, I'm gonna be able to lean on throughout this process. But when you said we, we managed transition, I'd love for you to break that down a little bit more and like, what are the points that that can make the deal fall down?
Because people haven't thought about how it's gonna go in the transition. What do we need to be thinking about early on about the transition or, or how. Different factors can affect that and how, why you all look at that so closely. 

Wendy: I think first and foremost is getting an idea of who's really maintaining the relationships with the people that are bringing you revenue.
Mm. So whether you're B2B or B2C, who is it that's driving those customers in your door? Um, it, it may be the owner and if the owner's, the person that's driving the customers in the door, like a local contracting company, um, or, you know, like a local, we have a local, [00:18:00] uh, HVAC firm that's been out here forever.
The guy that owns it has his face plastered on billboards all over town. I mean, if that company were to be purchased by somebody else and the community were to catch wind of it, I could see two of his competitors really stepping in and taking over his market share. Um, so maintaining a face is important, uh, maintaining the relationship with the people that are responsible for driving the revenues in the door.
Is important. Um, first and foremost, I think, so you've got top line budget sales, then you've got your cost of goods. So your labor that's providing the service that maintains the revenues coming in. So if you're an engineering firm and you have four people out there doing bids and jobs, and their names are all over whatever municipality they're bringing in work from, but you can't service those jobs without the team of engineers that specialize in, you know, subsurface concrete and, you know, [00:19:00] above ground stabilization for cell phone towers.
If you have any of those people leave, then your transition is, is just completely a mess and you've lost your production team, you've lost your revenues, you've lost your public awareness, the relationships with your clients. So whenever I tell people to prepare, you know, projections and prepare transition memos for my credit team.
I go to them and say, what are you thinking about as far as who's gonna maintain the relationships with the customers? And then what are your cost drivers and how do you protect and stabilize your cost drivers in the event that you have destabilization of cost drivers, whether it's loss of per loss of personnel, uh, tariffs, the cost of goods go up, things like that.
The sales in general, administrative expenses. I think industrywide can be somewhat stable. You can always go to a temp agency and backfill an SG&A employee. Um, but, uh, the cost of goods and sales, the two things at [00:20:00] the very top of the income statement is, is what you need to pay attention to, most of all in your transition risk.

Athena: So do you mind just walking us through top line, what the steps are from like, got an LOI signed, I come to you. Uh, it, you know, the structure will work and theory. So what, what happens next? Like how do what. What am I looking at in terms of the process from your end to get money to buy the business from signed LOI?

Wendy: Okay. So just quickly on revenue, I'm gonna be looking at stabilization of revenue, and if you have some bumps, I'm gonna wanna know why. So you need to dig into that. Um, dig into that first, and then I come back around and start asking accounting questions and I won't bore you with that kind of stuff, but there's all kinds of weird things in accounting processes that can screw up and make the appearance of destabilize revenues.
But I, I'll, I'll figure that out if you just go ask the questions first. [00:21:00] Um, from that point on, I'm looking for, um, adequacy of working capital structured into the deal. Uh, I need to talk to you a little bit about transition risk. Top line revenues are important. Static profitability as a percentage of sales is super important.
I can't underwrite off of a 20% profit margin in 2024. If your profit margins in all other periods are 8%.
So stability is a big thing. If I, if I can dot all the i's and cross on the T's on stability, transition, risk, tie you to the business industry in some way, shape or form. Um, have a plan to backfill key employees and or retain them. And I feel like there's adequate working capital built into the deal. I then prepare a credit memo, which is actually really short.
It doesn't look like there's much to it, but it takes me a long time to make sure I've got the best and the most correct answers to those, uh, key risk [00:22:00] issues. Um, and then if there are any issues, I mitigated them adequately. And like I said, it's a very simple short memo and I can probably pull one up and, and show you if you're interested 'cause it doesn't look like there's much to it.
But there, there really is a lot to it. Lemme see. I find one really quickly. So again, I'm putting together a memo and I'll try to talk and, and do two things at once, and then I send that to a credit officer. And so we don't have credit committee here, we don't have any algorithms. Um, but we do have credit officers that we have a queue assigned to.
So it's one big queue for my team. There's 32 of us. And, um, these credit officers pick up deals and roll them into their queue. And they try to be fair as far as like, okay, well I've already picked up two of Wendy's this week. Let me pass on this one, let somebody else pick hers up, and then I'll go to somebody else's, because everybody's got a little bit of a different personality.
Um, and [00:23:00] they, they wanna spread out our reputations and then spread out their reputations as well. So typically speaking, that credit officer will pick it up. And they have a service level agreement to get back to me within a day. Um, we're all human here. There's times where they get backed up, but you know, there's also times where they get back to me within an hour.
So they'll either send me an email and say, I'm good with this one. And then they do a very short SWOT analysis and then they forward it on to the entire underwriting team, and the underwriting manager logs that and says, this one's good to go. We need to look for an underwriting submission from Wendy Gormley in the next two to three days.
Um, so that two to three days is very dependent on how quickly you respond to my needs list. Um, I do have customers that it takes them weeks to put everything together. And I'll tell you that time kills deals. You wait too long. We're, you know, six weeks into the process, you get another month's worth of financials.
We see a significant downtrend, or they screw up a POS system. Their ERP system, you know, has a glitch and they can't record revenues. [00:24:00] Then we have to wait another month for them to correct themselves and it's just a big pain in the butt. So speed Is your friend here? Um, you need to be comfortable with understanding.
You're only gonna know about 70% of everything about this business. And you have to be comfortable knowing that you're gonna have to learn the rest along the way. And if you're not, you shouldn't be entertaining an LOI on that business. It's like getting married. You love somebody just enough to know that you believe you're gonna be hard spots and you're gonna work through 'em together.
And that's when you get married. And if you don't think you can work through hard spots together, then you don't need to be bidding on that business. Is that fair enough statement? 

Athena: Yeah. I love that. 

Wendy: Okay. Um, apparently I can't do two things at once. I'm trying to find you guys a good, good credit memo to look at and I don't know why I can't buy one.
Oh, okay. Here we go. Um, I'll open this up and make sure I can hide some personal information and then I'll show you what this looks like. But anyway, I'm gonna keep going. Um, so once we, um, get you through your pre-flight, I issue a proposal letter.
Our proposal 

Athena: letter is pre-flight is what part? Exactly. 

Wendy: So once you, once you get through credit, that's what we call a pre-flight. And so in order to get that proposal letter, you go through pre-flight, which is that first initial pass through credit where I'm putting this memo together. Got it. And once we get that done, you sign your proposal letter with us, and then you move into underwriting.
And then once you move into underwriting, our underwriters really kind of sweep you through the rest of the process. And they generally get you a full blown approval in less than 10 days. So our, our proposal memos don't normally fall apart during underwriting. They have a 98.6% success rate. Sometimes [00:26:00] it's 99, sometimes it's 94.
Um, if anything falls apart, it's normally some sort of discovery of an adverse material change, or the seller backs out or the buyer backs out. But it's not the, it's not the bank pulling, pulling the deal. Um, so I'll show you just quickly if you wanna see this. Number two.
So this is my pre-flight memo, and it's not like super lengthy, but I'm addressing the competitive advantages of the firm, the employee base licensing requirements, and a non-compete upfront. I'm talking about the breakdown. I. I have links to all my shared files, so files never get lost. I'm talking about the cash flow, the working capital adequacy.
I am running a full blown working capital cycle analysis on a refi that I do, talking about the personal credit and liquidity of the borrowers [00:27:00] industry and management experience here. Then I talk about the equity injection, how much structure, how we're structuring it, does it meet SBA eligibility requirements, talking about collateral.
And then at the bottom here, his lender communicated directly with the borrower only through the broker. And so in this case, it's off market. I've only communicated with the borrower. And then there, are there any other specific elements about the deal that you consider particularly risky? I've gotta be honest here because if I'm not honest, they're gonna start thinking I'm a liar.
'cause not every deal is perfect. Right? So that's the, that's the nuts and bolts of what my credit memo entails. Um, generally speaking, once you get through that and you get to underwriting, they're not gonna have many other questions. It's gonna be pretty simple stuff like, oh, I see you're relocating. Have you priced out?
What your new lease expense is gonna be at. Can you give me an idea of what that is so I can finish the global cash flow and doctor it up? Um, or, Hey, I noticed that we're gonna end up having a collateral, you know, shortfall. You've got all these other investment properties. You know, Wendy took five of them based on [00:28:00] the appraisals that we got.
Looks like we're gonna be short, we're gonna have to take one more. They're doing things like that to button up the file and paper the file for the SBA. Um, and then that goes back to the same senior credit officer that approved the pre-flight and then they're issuing a commitment letter. 

Athena: Um, okay, so the credit memo, which is that the thing you just showed us, that's the kind of bulk of the research. And you mentioned a needs list.
Is that coming before or after the credit memo? Like, uh, pre-flight stage. So what I gathered was the pre-flight was you've done the credit memo, credit says yes, then that's the pre-flight done, you sign it, then you go into underwriting. That's [00:29:00] where the needs list comes through to verify everything that you put in the credit memo.
Did I correct ate that correctly? Okay. You, you nailed 

Wendy: it. 

Athena: So the credit memo process with you is gathering what kind of data, what kinds of things should people have, have ready to be able to get that, uh, together for you? What kinds of documents are, are they needing to collect or information? Um, and are there things that break it before the pre-flight is done that they can be looking for earlier?

Wendy: Number one priority is try to squeeze tax returns out of a broker. If you can't get 'em, get the financial statements, but get a good set of accrual, set of financial statements. Um, we wanna take a look at the accrual balance sheet. We wanna look at AR and AP and run a cash cycle analysis on it because working capital is critical, cannot finance a business that's not adequately capitalized.[00:30:00] 
Um, and if we end up in a situation where a seller just won't budge and they want to take all the AR, then I need to figure out a way to lend enough money to backfill that gap. And if I can't do it on the front end. You probably don't want to spend your time trying to negotiate something that's never gonna happen.
So accrual statements AR/AP, and then sales by customer reports for every period, not don't run something from 22 to 25. 'cause over three and a half years, that's not gonna tell me much of anything. I wanna see the AR report now and I wanna see sales by customer in the past 12 months for every year because if we have 50% of sales allocated to one customer through an MSA, that just ended and that one customer rolls off in 2024.
Even if you've backfilled the same sales with 20, 25 revenues and you've got a nice WIP report, that's still gonna affect your business valuation. So I'm probably gonna need to stress the previous three years. And make some sort of [00:31:00] a case that we don't know how stable the 25 revenues are. So we're gonna do a seller note that's contingent on maintaining of top line revenues.

Athena: Got it. Um, you mentioned the WIP report and backfilling AR do you mind just breaking that down into 10th grader language? Like why is that important? 

Wendy: Okay. So, um, fabrication shop up in Illinois been around for 40 years. Um, they lost a master service agreement (MSA) contract with a large processing plant nearby.
So for 10 years, 50% of the revenues came from one big customer. And in early 2024 that ended because that, that customer bought a similar company. So they don't need to outsource that fabrication service anymore. So the, the, the seller. Went out to the market and replaced [00:32:00] $4 million a year worth of revenue that was lost with a whole bunch of different customers.
And that's great. Um, but the problem is those are all new customers and we don't know how long those jobs are. So there's something called a Work in Progress report that you can go get that's gonna show who those customers are and how much work has been completed towards that project. So you can have eight customers that all have a half a million dollar contract, but we need to know how long, is it half a million dollar contract?
How much work are you gonna do on that half a million contract over a year? We wanna see are these a type customers or are they mom and pop shops around the corner? That might be subject to economic changes in the local environment and maybe they can't pay you in two months. So a work in progress report is also called a WIP report.
So that's super important when we're looking at people that are taking on LA large jobs to try to qualify what's coming up. And how much work is left inside of that contract. Because if you have a WIP report that says, I have $8 million worth of [00:33:00] contracts, but I've already done $7 million worth of work, we only really, you only have a million dollars of a contract left.
Mm-hmm. And so what are we gonna do to backfill the empty utilization within that plant? Um, so sales by customer, AR AP for working capital. Um, and then if there's any shortfall, I'm gonna ask for that WIP report to try to solidify that the new revenues are gonna be stable. So those are the three things at the bottom of my needs list on the seller side that absolutely tell me everything I need to know about the business.
As far as from a financial standpoint, I mean, we're still gonna dig into how many employees that they have. Have you ever managed employees like that? Are they educated? Are they not educated? Things like that later on. But on the high level, we're just gonna make sure the company's stable and there's no point in negotiating LOI if you have no idea what the cash cycle is.
If you have no idea who the sales by customers are, 

Athena: period. Yeah. And there's a lot of, you know, [00:34:00] there's a lot of gatekeeping now of that information pre-LOI, so it's like immediately after LOI is when we're gonna get access to that sort of stuff. So just making, you know, a lot of times we're making offers to the best of our ability with the information that they're giving us.

Wendy: And you may have to, as like, as competitive as it is, sometimes you just need to get into LOI and then retrade the LOI a bit later. 

Athena: Yeah. And, and then getting that information kind of right away. So, um, something, something that was funny that came up with one of our clients recently was the broker being like, well, the SBA is just gonna give you working capital.
And I'm like, well, you're, you're paying for it, right? So, um, talk us through how y'all look at working capital. How do you determine it? Um, I'll stop there and then I'll ask some more questions on it. 'cause it's a topic that obviously comes up a lot. Um, you know, it's, it's necessary. Small business brokers that are old school think it's, you know, cash free, debt free, et cetera.
And it's [00:35:00] very hard to kind of like try to get them to include working capital sometimes. But you are gonna wanna include it regardless. Talk us through how y'all look at it, why you think it's important, what folks can it, it's a concept that's hard I think for some, for people to kind of wrap their heads around.

Wendy: So the easiest 10th way, 10th grade way of just ball parking it is to look at as many periods of a balance sheet as you can and take current assets minus current liabilities. You don't even have to understand the concept of why you're doing that, but if you've got 600,000 in this period, 400,000 in this period, but then 900,000, 800,000, 900,000, 800,000, 900,000, you're probably gonna need to assume that your current assets minus current liabilities, need to be closer to seven to 800,000, not four or 500,000 like they are in the most recent period, or vice versa.[00:36:00] 
Because as companies have growth up and down and there's cyclicality in it, the working capital that is sucked up into the company at any given point in time is what is making that machine run. It's like taking the gasoline out of a car and saying, go. You still have to stop and put gas in it before it can go again.
So you can't necessarily have a cash free, debt free transaction. If you end up with somebody that insists on it and you have the wherewithal to backfill $500,000 worth of working capital and put an equity injection, well then kudos to you. I'm not gonna stop you from doing it, but we're gonna make sure you've got the cash in the bank to support it.
So that's the easiest way to do it. Um, I have other more technical ways of doing it where I'm taking the accounts payable plus accounts receivable plus inventory days on hand, and I'm looking at that period over period, over period, over period, almost quarterly or monthly. And that's actually addressing the cash cycle.
Um, so you can do the easy math, which is assets minus liabilities, [00:37:00] but then I'm gonna double check the cycle. So for some solar installation companies that I was working on before. That that pers, that buyer has to know they're gonna buy this business and they're gonna have to pay for these supplies to come in from China.
They're gonna have to sit on 'em until permits are pulled, until they can go to the installations. They're gonna have to pay the staff to do the installation, hire the construction companies to bust up the concrete work with the electrical companies to tap them into the grid, then build a customer, then wait 40 fives to get days to get paid.
So that one half a million dollar project for the airport, you have now financed and you're waiting eight months to get paid. So you've gotta have not only all the money to fund the supplies, but you've gotta pay all these people to do the work before you get reimbursed for it. So then you start having these conversations about what is the true cost of your capital?
That's when you're kind of [00:38:00] like, okay, well I gotta borrow it. 9% from Live Oak Bank to backfill half a million bucks of term capital. Why don't you just leave it in the business or I'm not gonna buy it 

Athena: or significantly lower your purchase price. Right. You know, 'cause I'm, I'm gonna have to pay for it one way or another.
Um, how do you, I mean, you work with a lot of brokers also, so it seems like brokers haven't really caught on to this concept. Like, how are you explaining it to them? Have you gotten them to kind of change their tune towards working capital included in, in the purchase price? 

Wendy: It's actually getting a lot better.
Um, I'm seeing a lot of improvement. Um, I might, I might cry a little when I say this, but the bigger firms, the Sunbelts, the Trans Worlds, the Murphys, they're, they're really kind of coming around to this concept now and they're doing a better job of training the brokers, most of them. I can see what's happening behind your eyes as I say that to you right now.
[00:39:00] Um, we go to the same conferences, uh. With, with the guys that don't get it, I typically will open up my screen and share it with them. And it's math, don't shoot the messenger. It's math. I'm gonna show you exactly what my spreads are saying and you can make the decision on if you wanna work with my borrower or if you wanna go try to find somebody that's willing to take down the whole, the whole project and fund the working capital.
At least they know their options. 

Athena: So I mean, that's, that's in the SOP that, that you can't fund more than a business valuation. Right, right. Working capital factors into the business valuation. Can you talk through that part of it real quick? Um, like what you're able to lend on. 'cause if somebody's like, well, I wanna pay that much anyway, and the, the valuation comes back differently, then, then you're not able to.
So what, what's that part of the process look like? 

Wendy: So, um, just quickly, I'll say that if I wanna go buy a [00:40:00] golf cart that has four batteries in it, and it is $8,000. And the day that I buy it, the guy wants to take the batteries out. Well, it's gonna cost me two grand to put batteries back in it. Is that golf cart really worth eight grand?
No, it's worth six. So when you take working capital out of a business, you're taking out an asset. And if you remove an asset from a business, that does affect the business valuation. So if I order a valuation and then the last minute that seller says, I don't wanna provide you with any AR and I'm taking the inventory and I'm not leaving any cash in the account, I'm gonna go back to the valuation company and have them adjust it based on the new LOI.
And I will guarantee you that business valuation's gonna come back at a much lower value. That's why valuation companies need an LOI to move forward. Um, did that answer the question? Oh, the, the valuation? Yes. So we're not allowed to lend more than 90% of the business valuation period. 

Athena: Right. Um, so the working capital ends up being [00:41:00] a pretty essential conversation.
I love the golf cart batteries, and I'm always looking for analogies to like, try to belabor the point. I'm like, well, if you're buying a vending machine business and they just give you a bunch of vending machines that are empty with no inventory, and I you've just bought equipment, you haven't bought a business.
Right. Other, yeah. 

Athena: Um, on the inventory point, we have a, a couple folks that are looking at deals with inventory and, and, uh, you know, how settling the inventory requirements, like what's considered working capital versus excess in inventory. How have y'all seen, or how have you seen people deal with the inventory?
Of a business. And what, what do you think are like best ways that you've seen people [00:42:00] solve the inventory in a deal, conversation or, uh, structuring. 

Wendy: So we can analyze inventory just like we can work in capital. There's backwards looking analysis that we can do to see what's an average amount of inventory based on sales and costs of goods sold if they have a somewhat acceptable inventory management system.
So we will analyze that. Um, due diligence providers can do that for you as well. I also have a firm that will knock out an inventory analysis report for like three grand. They haven't done a couple weeks. It's like super easy and you're, you move on down the road. Um, you are gonna ask for an average amount of inventory to be left into the deal period.
That is how it needs to be done. Um, if they insist that, I'm trying to think of one to use. Okay. Perfumania in a mall. Um. There is an abundance of inventory in those things because they want the shelves to look full. They actually have great inventory [00:43:00] management systems. The average amount of inventory is probably less than a third of what they actually have on stock.
But they want you to buy all of it. Um, you can buy all of it as long as the cash flow supports it, but an average amount of inventory is what's gonna impact the valuation. And if you're gonna buy more inventory, it just has to cash flow. So I can't just like arbitrarily say, here's the value of the business, but I'm also gonna buy a million dollars worth of inventory.
And it's, it's just not gonna, it's not all gonna cash flow. Um, you can do things where you're buying inventory on consignment, um, but you have to make sure, I'm trying to think of another, there, there have been times where the consignment. Issue can kill the deal because the SBA wants to include in the project, like in the grid that we structure.
And if I, if I arbitrarily [00:44:00] add, let's just say you need $400,000 worth of inventory, but the seller insists you take a million. If I add that million dollars of inventory, even if it's in a consignment agreement, the SBA looks at that as total project cost, and then they want your equity injection to increase, even though we're not financing it, and it's on consignment.
If it's mandatory, you purchase it in the sale, then it increase your project cost regardless of who's financing it and your equity injection goes through the roof. 

Athena: Okay. So I think that's the caveat though, mandatory, right? So if the seller leaves the average inventory, they have a whole bunch of excess, excess inventory and you're like, well, we'll put it on consignment.
I'll buy it as I need it, but only as I need it. They're not requiring you to buy it. That's where we can get over the project cost issue. Yeah. 

Wendy: As you need it. And there's no guarantee that you will buy it from them. 

Athena: Right. And that's a way that I've been talking to people about overcoming any like dead.
[00:45:00] Inventory, right? Because a lot, a lot of inventory sellers has, it's like, it's not necessarily good inventory or inventory that you want, but they're like, but it's worth this much. Like, well, I don't know if I can actually sell it. So like doing a consignment arrangement where you only buy what you need as you need it and, and not making any guarantees that you will buy all of it, um, is, is good for structuring and the equity injection you need to bring.
And then also doesn't require you to buy inventory that's not necessarily gonna be a good use to you. 

Wendy: And you can also style it, is that the inventory that's being left in the deal is considered to be first out. So you don't have to go into a room and warehouse and say, these shelves are mine. You can just say, I'm gonna document everything through a POS system until we hit 400,000.
And then after that I'll start buying from you on consignment. 

Athena: Smart. I like that. First out, writing that down. Um, so, uh, folks, if you have any [00:46:00] questions, feel free to put your hands up. You know, I'm just gonna keep asking questions to make sure we're, we're filling air time here, but want everybody to get their individual questions answered.
I, I am gonna ask Wendy about how they're looking at the license thing in a moment. Um, but, uh, a lot of people are looking at real estate in, uh, their deals. So does that factor any differently for you when somebody has real estate that they're also able to purchase? Does that make it more attractive to you?
Does it not matter as long as they're bringing the right amount of equity? How does, how does real estate play in how you look at 

Wendy: deals? Um, real estate is great because we have some sort of collateral, but for Live Oak Bank, it's not, I. It doesn't really matter to us one way or the other because again, we're looking at total cash flow and transition risk.
Um, thankfully we're back to some of our really old rules with real estate. It changed temporarily last year. We are back to using use of proceeds as a calculation to determine the [00:47:00] length of, determine the amortization, um, for about a year. The SBA stated that. Regardless of use of proceeds, it's the purchase price and the allocation between real estate and the going concern of the business that determines the term.
It's no longer the case. So if you have a, um, a $2 million deal and a million dollars is for real estate and a million dollars is for going concern, I'm gonna allocate your equity injection against the going concern, which reduces my use of proceeds allocated to the going concern, where then the use of proceeds allocated to real estate is more than 51% of the project.
So in that case, if real estate is more than 51% of the use of proceeds, I can stretch your term out further, all the way up to 25 years. If for whatever reason the use of proceeds allocation between real estate and going concern falls below 51% to real estate, I'm gonna use a weighted blended amortization.
And many times you end up between [00:48:00] 16 and 18 years on those. 

Athena: Okay, so let me, let me replay that back to you and then also layer in a question. So when we're seeing use of proceeds, it, it is where the cash from the loan is going. Right? So if you can apply the full down payment against the going concern, which is a business mm-hmm.
Which pulls the real estate into the 51% or more of where the cash is actually going, that's where we can get the 25 year amortization. Does this also come into play if there's a seller note that can make the real estate more than 51% of the cash that's going out? So if this, if, if we apply a seller note to the business to make the real estate more than 51% of the use of proceeds or the total loan that's being paid out, is that another way around it Potentially, 

Wendy: yes, there is uhhuh.

Athena: Great. Okay. So we can use seller notes to, [00:49:00] to. 

Wendy: Offset, 

Athena: offset the overall price of the business. Um, and it, so if you're doing the blended, it's still 10% of the project costs, but it's just how you're applying it. Correct. So if we're adding real estate into a deal, you know, 2 million for a business and 2 million for real estate, we're applying the 10% to the business.
But it's still a 400,000, let's say the whole project cost is, you know, 4 million. It's still 400,000 that we need to bring. 

Wendy: Correct. 

Athena: Okay, great. It looks like Andrew has a question. Andrew, what's your question for Wendy? 

Andrew: How you doing? Good. 

Anke: Good to see you. 

Andrew: Good to see you. Um, hey, and I, I, I don't think anyone's asked this or a think it's, I had like a small blip where I wasn't on, but, um, when you are getting kind of those incoming things for a deal, like just sign an LOI, I'm sending you everything when we're first starting this whole process.
What do you like to [00:50:00] see by way of, uh, models and things like that and assumptions Are you wanting, you know, do you, would you rather see someone give you like three different scenarios? What happens if we lose revenue? What happens if we break even? What happens if we increase certain percentage? What do you care?
Or are you just gonna build the whole thing yourself? 

Wendy: I just wanna see that you've done a three year historical look back to make sure that we've got decent profitability in every period. There hasn't been a whole bunch of bumpiness in the financials and we don't have a bunch of noise. And you've at least thought through the process of are you gonna pay yourself a salary?
Did you add back the owner salary? Are you gonna have to replace the CFO? Things like that. So, all I care about is seeing whether or not you've done enough legwork to understand the past three years historical financials. 

Andrew: Okay. Well, because like you, the reason I ask, you said in the beginning, I mean, pretty much the second you get on a phone call with somebody, you're already being evaluated by the bank, right?
So how can we best put our, put the best foot forward to make sure that we're not, we don't look like idiots out here, um, while also still, you [00:51:00] know, you wanna put forth the most optimistic approach you can. That, that's kind of the underlying question. I wanna give a realistic approach, but I also don't wanna say, Hey, I'm gonna just totally screw this thing up and I'm gonna lose revenue every single year for the next 10 years.
But I don't know. I figured there was a happy medium, but I, what you, what you said makes sense. 

Wendy: No, I think that if you're thinking that far in advance that I'm gonna, I'm gonna pick up on that. I'm gonna see it through our conversation. You don't have to worry about trying to put it in paper. Um, please know that I'm also underwriting to a stressed scenario because we expect to dip with every transition and it's pretty much happened.
But I love the fact that you're thinking about it. And if you just hit me up with a couple bullet points on this is why I like the deal. These are my potential pitfalls, but this is how I see I can mitigate 'em. You can probably knock that out in like six bullet points. And that's all I need in four.
That's all I need. 

Athena: Um, also, Wendy hasn't seen our new and improved model yet. We're gonna schedule some time for me to take her through it and [00:52:00] get her feedback on anything in addition. But Wendy, it's, it's got three year look backs with debt service coverage ratio on the, all the tranches. It's, you know, got 10 year look ahead on the debt service coverage ratio on like three different models.
So like no change. Best case, worst case. Um, so it's, it's giving them a lot of firepower to be able to like analyze, um, both backwards and forwards. You said you always model for a dip. Is there like set percentage or is it deal dependent when you're looking at like worse, worst case or, you know, anticipating that dip the J curve.

Wendy: We typically model a 20% dip in revenue. And in my spreads there's gonna be an extra stress scenario if interest rates go up that I model to, but it's nothing fancy. 

Athena: And on that 20% dip, are you looking just that the loans can be paid or you're still looking for the debt service coverage ratio to be at 1.5 with a [00:53:00] 20% dip?

Wendy: We're actually not underwriting the dip to A-D-S-C-R. Okay. We're just look, trying to look at it to see what would it look like and Right. There's actually a, another segment of, um, the underwriting process called a, a site visit. Doesn't mean I've been there, but it's another conversation we have. And it's another form that I fill out where I talk to the buyer about how would you manage through a 20% dip?
And it's more of a narrative that I'm attesting to. 

Athena: Oh, okay. So people can start getting ahead of that by thinking about it themselves. How would I manage a 20% dip in revenue? Is that just in year one or over several years? 

Wendy: It's actually a hundred percent verbal. Um, and it's, I literally just asked the question, what would you do if you have a 20% drop in revenue?
And whatever you tell me is whatever I write. So for some people, like the, the guy with the wife in the HR buying the 40-year-old business in um, Albuquerque, I asked him and the seller, what would you do? And he said it would literally have to be something so cataclysmic like, 'cause even Covid didn't [00:54:00] make us have a dip in 20% of our revenue.
So it's a mobile glass restoration company. Just so you know. If you ever have a window go out in an Applebee's or in a building downtown, the trucks out there putting the new glass in. Apparently those things are stable as all get out. So 

Athena: if you find one, get into LOI quick. But yeah, I imagine you might get some industry updates looking for those.
Let's put 'em out. Awesome. Andrew, did that answer your question? 

Andrew: Yeah. 

Athena: Great. Good question. Um, and y'all please keep putting your hands up if you have more questions for Wendy. Um, so like we've, we've kind of gone over the SOP changes pretty deeply internally, but, uh, the, the thing that has been still kind of a question mark, 'cause I think each bank's interpreting it differently, is if the business needs a license, you know, typically lenders are asking for the [00:55:00] outgoing owner to have a percentage of ownership to maintain the license in the business.
But now with the new SOP change, it's asking for unlimited PG for the first two years. Right. So, um, how are you all looking at that? Um, how do you anticipate it's gonna affect any deals where there's a license involved? 

Wendy: So we as a, a lending team talked about this a lot. Just last week when we were all in North Carolina.
Um. Very candidly, we're, we're really kind of not excited about this because the, the stance that the bank has is that if you are going to be purchasing something that requires a license, you need to have that license, which kind of goes back to the SBAs reasoning behind two years direct industry experience.
Or there needs to be two people minimum inside the business that have a license. And if it's not two, then one for certain, you need [00:56:00] to have a plan to get your license. And then you probably also need to start training that third person to be in a position where they can take a test.

Athena: And what about the ownership? Like, uh, with this, this pg it's, it's not a change. It's going back to the way it was from my understanding. So like with the, that, how are you, how are you all looking at that? 'cause I imagine a lot of deals were getting done by. Giving or, you know, keeping the license in with a small percentage of ownership.
But now that there's a pg I don't think many owners are gonna be happy with that. So have y'all, I'm, I'm sure you've had a lot of discussions about that. How are you guys looking at that? 

Wendy: Well, I've already lost deals because of that. Um, and I don't blame the seller for not wanting to personally guarantee a loan that on a business he no longer has control over.
Um, so I don't anticipate that we are gonna see many partial changes of ownership at all anymore. I, I think that [00:57:00] not, I think I've been told directly by, um, you know, our, our, our lobby individual that actually keeps her office in Washington. There were people on the hill that just never wanted this program to be able to finance.
Limited change of ownerships, period. And so this was a compromise in order to keep the option open so that in the event that you have an entire family running a business and the son-in-law has been working there for 30 years and they wanna buy it from the father-in-law, the father-in-law's probably gonna be comfortable personally guaranteeing the loan for another two years.
And that is where they would like to see the partial changes of ownerships stay in that corner. So I just don't see this program being used much anymore at all. I think we're gonna have to go back to looking at things the way we did for forever, which is a hundred percent change of ownership. You better have a license if you don't.
You've gotta have a plan in place to get one. You gotta be sure that you're gonna be able to get one, and then you need to have a solid employee that has one [00:58:00] and you need to have another employee that's close to being able to get one. 

Athena: Got it. Okay. So you need a plan to get it yourself. You need an employee that has one and you need to have another employee that's close to getting one.

Wendy: Right. 

Athena: And this is your, your stance. It's not the SOP specifically. 

Wendy: Right. 

Athena: Got it. Okay. Um, and then, you know, you talked about, uh, I, I would love to get something you mentioned earlier on was like this, this woman said she needed a therapist. So it sounds like there was some psychological things that was keeping her from moving forward on a deal and not the deal itself.
Uh, we certainly get a front row seat to a lot of the, the, you know, deliberations that people go through when they make a very scary decision to take out a personal guarantee on a multimillion dollar loan. Um, what do you think holds people up through this process the most? [00:59:00] Or what are you seeing are like the commonalities between people not moving forward?
Not because of the business itself, but other things And how have you seen people get over that, if at all? 

Wendy: Um, there's all kinds of reasons that things fall through. Um, I love my borrowers because my borrowers are all pretty much Johnny on the spot, somewhat control freaks, definitely label all of you guys type A.
Mm-hmm. And I wouldn't have it any other way, but there is a, there is a, a seller out there that kind of just sits back and lets things happen when they want 'em to happen and they don't like to be pushed and they wanna chew on decisions before having to react to 'em. Um, that is a situation that occurs a lot right now.
And so I have a lot of buyers very frustrated with the pace at which the sellers are, are moving, which is slow. Um, and deals fall apart when you take too long. So that's, that's one thing. But on the flip side of that is, you [01:00:00] know, I was telling the lady that needed some therapy. I was like, okay, can you imagine?
And this is a deal that died because of the changes coming up. 'cause there was a, it was a partial change, it was an architectural firm. I said, can you imagine what it would've been like working with these people day in and day out? And you've got a seller that wants to go do mission work and then play golf with his buddies and then take his wife out to dinner and you're trying to get a deadline completed for a big job for that you're trying to win.
I said, how do you think that's gonna go over? Because she's a results goal oriented driven C-suite executive with a whole lot of letters behind her name. The culture's probably not a good fit. So I think that's, that's first and foremost is you need to evaluate whether or not the culture's gonna be right for you.
Um, you need to meet the seller and you need to know that. If you marry that seller, you're gonna be able to work with that person through [01:01:00] thick and thin until you get the hang of it and you can take your training wheels off. Um, so that's the other thing too, is you actually like the seller. Um, trust is a big thing.
Um, fear is a big thing as well. Um, there's no point in carrying yourself through a process if you aren't comfortable with being uncomfortable. 'cause that's, you're gonna be uncomfortable. You're gonna be uncomfortable not knowing, not trusting. The first year you're gonna be drinking through a fire hose.
You're gonna have to have the energy to pull off a transition because don't think you're gonna sleep. It's like having a baby. I talked to all my buyers after they closed, they're all exhausted. Um, so yeah,

Athena: that some, uh, oh, you just froze for a second, but that was, that was a good, uh, ending point. So, um. Something you also said earlier was being comfortable with knowing 70%. Can you elaborate more [01:02:00] on that percentage, what you mean and, and why that's, that's kind of common in this situation? 

Wendy: Well, you, you're doing enough due diligence to get into LOI, which is not much.
Then you have a short period of time to learn as much as you can possibly learn about a company in like 45 to 60 days. You still don't know much about that company. It's gonna take you another year to find out where the dead bodies are, to figure out what the personalities of the staff are like, to find out what the real embedded culture of the organization is like.
So you're never gonna know a hundred percent before you get in. You're gonna have to be uncomfortable taking that leap and knowing that you're gonna have to figure some stuff out. First three months are pretty critical. After that, things will stabilize a little bit, but then he might also get blindsided with two of your key employees quitting on week one.
So you're, you're just [01:03:00] never gonna be able to find out everything you want to find out in a 90 to a hundred day day window before the business that you're talking about. Understanding a living, breathing organism. That's probably been around 10, 15 years. 

Athena: Mm-hmm. Yeah. What 70% should we be paying attention to then 

Wendy: paying attention to the high notes.
Um, who's leading the, the customers driving in the door? I. Um, who has influence within the organization? What's the staffing matrix? What are the roles and responsibilities of everybody working there? What, how are, how do they interact together? Is there constant frustration or what's the tenure of the employees?
What's the personality of the person driving the train? Or is it pretty l fair? Are they used to being micromanaged? Does everybody do the same job day in and day out, or are they cross-trained? Um, you know, how sticky are the customers? Are there any customer concentrations? What's the working capital cycle?
I think that's pretty much it. And you can uncover a lot just through verbal meetings with the [01:04:00] seller visiting the site, trying to get in front of employees. I have a lot of people that meet employees before they close. 

Athena: Yeah. Um, and, and sometimes you're not able to, but I've heard of people overcoming this by like, I.
Having like a couple days session with the seller before they transition, where they're just interviewing among literally everyone give me their performance reviews, let's talk about it. Um, so it, like, it's, it's, it's not okay not to dig into it and, and ask the questions. And I, I think it's really, uh, illuminating that you brought that up.
'cause it's not talked about a lot in the a TA circles, right? It's like looking at the cash and that sort of thing with the people are what make this business. So really getting to understand the culture and the owner, but also who's the team that you're gonna be taking after. And if you can't get access to 'em, how can you get as much information as you can about them?
It's one of the things that, that come up in the QoE report too is like, um, the, um, [01:05:00] I was gonna say transition. That's not right. The turnover of team and stuff like that. Mm-hmm. That tells you a lot too. Um, I was seeing a lot of head nods from Peter during your, your last chat about transition. So y'all, Peter is, is, uh, our newest, uh, member of buyers club, but he's actually bought a business before about seven years ago.
So he's been through this. Peter, what's your question or comment for Wendy? I'm not sure which one it is, but 

Peter: it's, it's definitely more of a comment. Um, so, so one of the things that well fir first of all, uh, Wendy, I loved your, um, quick explanation. Working capital. Working capital is an asset. You're moving asset from a business, all other things being equal.
Duh. The value of the business should goes down. Therefore, if you're gonna pay a higher price for lower value, that's a bad deal. Okay? Mm-hmm. Are we doing bad deals? Got it. That was the most perfect through line understanding I've ever had of working capital. So that was beautiful. [01:06:00] Um, the, the other thing I'll say, just from my own experience and just like an experience share, um, that transition period is also, uh, you know, um, it's critical.
And one of the mistakes I made looking back is, and, and you mentioned world type A, right? So it's, it's, it's, it's an easy mistake to make. You see how, you know, kind of that first three months of the business, you see all the like fucked up things going on. You're like, I would never do it that way. These people are buffoons.
I will tell you that is a trap and that is a great way to shoot yourself on the foot because then you start changing things, not fully understanding how all of. The buffoonery is connected, so you're only gonna change one part of the buffoonery and go, oh yeah, I'm, I'm a fucking genius. And it's like, no, you're not, you're a goofball.
And you know, you, you just wrestled with a pig and what you forgot [01:07:00] was pigs like mud, and you don't, so that was dumb, right? So it's like, it's like that, you know, that's kind of the one thing I remember about, you know, before you change anything, just really get a lay of the land that first couple months.
And even if you just absolutely hate it. Everything going on. As long as like the cash stays constant. 'cause that's how, that's your entire financial risk. It's like, okay, if that's cool, just like get the lay of the land. Don't change too much. Not knowing how all these things are connected. So anyway, that was 

Wendy: Peter.
I think that's your next New York Times bestseller. Peter Jackson's. Don't Change the Buffoonery. 

Athena: I love that. Seriously. But I mean it's, it's, it's so, and when you are type in, you're like, oh my God, the inefficiency, what are you doing? It's like, until you understand how that inefficiency works itself and how it plays into the bigger picture, you're putting everything at risk, right?
[01:08:00] Because you're buying something that's been operating in a certain way and you go in and change it before you understand what you're changing or why you're changing it. Just 'cause you think, like you see inefficiency, right? I heard a story of a woman that. Bought a business. Um, it was a manufacturing business and they had like fax machine and, and normal phone lines.
And they changed it to, you know, voiceover system ended up losing their, their phone lines for a week. And it turns out that's how they got all their orders. So they lost an entire week of revenue doing that. Right. So, um, I, I send the first 90 days to everybody when they, they get under LOI, but I, I still think 90 days probably isn't enough.
And Peter, you've been through it, but, um, from, from the, the stories that I hear, it's, it's, it's a year to just understand it. It's two years before you're like, okay, I feel like I know what I'm doing here. Yeah. Um, hundred 

Peter: percent. 

Athena: So, [01:09:00] um, great comment Peter, and we're so excited to have you here too. 'cause you, you, uh, you've, you've been through this.
Um, Wendy, I'm curious, uh, you know, I hear a lot of lenders say like, you know, half of our conversation is, is about the buyer themselves. So we kind of talked about, um, you know, the thing they need to, uh, be able to connect the dots between them and the business. But what, what, what are some best practices in terms of how people go through this process?
How are they showing up with their deal? Um, are they packaging things in a certain way? Like, are they creating little CIMs for you with all their information? Like what are some things that have just delighted you and helped sales p sail people's deals through to close? 

Wendy: Um, I, I'm not one that wants to try to formalize a process because everybody's different, but I will tell you that the lady that I sent to my older borrower [01:10:00] that needed therapy, um, what I loved about him particularly is through all the masses of buyers.
Like I said, he kept showing up with an email saying, I wanna talk to you about this. This is what I've learned. This is what I think. I wanna get your thoughts. I need 15 minutes. Boom. I picked up the phone. It, it reached a point where we bypass the teams meetings and I would just like see an email and I would just pick up the phone and call while driving and we would just knock it out.
He was thought forward, prepared, planned if he saw a road bump. He went and researched the problem first and then came back to me with some solutions, and I don't know why it took me so long to. Be able to articulate that to my other buyers because that's what they expect of me as an employee at the bank.
If I go to any of my superiors with the problem, they better expect that I've already looked for three [01:11:00] different solutions and I'm just asking for their blessing on which one. So for me, he's always gonna stand out in my mind because he literally was the easiest person to work with and this was not a company that had everything perfect with it.
He just made it easy to take these problems and find solutions, and it just moved so effortlessly all the way down the road. And he still continuing to do that in the closing process, or sorry, post-closing, because he closed clip notes. We had to take an extra piece of properties, collateral, because he didn't sell it in time.
Um, interesting situation. He does some house flipping. It just wasn't built yet. There was some delays on it. I'm like, well, we have to take it, otherwise we could lose our guarantee. So we took it. And so now he's working with my portfolio manager on trying to get it released, but even with correspondence with her, he'll send an email, copy me, and he'll say, Kelly, this is what's transpired since I spoke to you last.
This is what I would like to talk to you about, and this is what I think we can do to get this property [01:12:00] released. Here's my substitution of collateral. Once your thoughts, she's already responded to him. They're talking like Monday, I think. Yeah. So it's just, it's just being a, a, a thought forward, almost like treating this like you're an employee, right?
If you wanna push a project forward at work, are you gonna go to your boss and say, uh, what do I do now? Or are you gonna say, This is what I wanna do, I just want your concurrence with it. 

Athena: I, I love that, Wendy, and it's such a good point because like, uh, I think a lot of people get it wrong. By, and, and you know, I made this mistake when I was going after my big deal and I didn't understand how structuring works is like, you try to lean on the lender to help you solve the problems.
And while you are there to, you know, act as a guide, you are a much better guide if they're thinking through and coming to you with what they think will work. 

Wendy: Mm-hmm. 

Athena: Um, so what I think is a no-no that a lot of people [01:13:00] do is they'll lob the CIM over, they'll lob all the financial statements. They won't have reviewed it themselves, and they'll be like, what do you think?
Uh, you know, as opposed to somebody being like, here's all the CIM and the financial statements if you'd like to look into it, but here's my financial model, here's my read on it. This is why I like it. For me, these are what I see the problems potentially are. Um, here's what I haven't gotten back from the, you know, broker yet and what I'm gonna be working on, but I would love to know if this looks like something that you, you know, are seeing anything.
That you wouldn't move forward with at this point. Right. So like, you know, and you, you'd do that with a, like, I love that. Like, you, you know, if you treat it like an employee, you wanna get a new initiative off the ground with your boss, right? Or like, you see a problem in the business and it's just like, I don't like this.
You know, it's like, okay, what would you like me to do with that information? Um, so being solution focused. And I think, uh, another mindset [01:14:00] shift that, um, I don't think anyone here has, but what I've, I've seen in the past is people thinking that the, the banks work for you and they should be like, jumping, you know?
And it's like you're trying to ask for millions of dollars, right? And, and like, and oftentimes on nothing, you know, an airball, there's no assets in the business, nothing. And like on them wanting to be like, yes, I believe in this person to run this business. So the way you interact, if you show them like how you're gonna be as a business owner.
Then that's probably gonna, you know, influence the how quickly people are gonna wanna work you, how much they like working with you. You know? Um, I, I take it really like if somebody's, if somebody has the means to give me money, like, I'm like, whatever you need, I'm jumping, you know, I'm like, give me everything.
I'm trying to make it really easy for you. Um, and just being really, like, I, I was, I was grateful. I'm like, you're helping our business be able to do something it wasn't able to do before. Like, you're helping us help more people buy businesses. Like, thank you so much. And they were like, we loved working on it. Like, I want that, you know? Mm-hmm. 
[01:15:00] Um, so if you think of like, you know, this has the potential.
This person has the potential to like meaningfully change your life, right? And, and if you help them to, to do that, I know Wendy cares so much. She knows every single borrower. She's going out and doing social time with them and cares about them, cares about their lives, knows about them. Um, that makes you wanna work with someone when they treat you well and they make your life easier to help you.
So that was a bit of a rant, I guess, or went all [01:16:00] over the place. But essentially, you know, if you come to them and make their life easier to be able to help you do something that's gonna meaningfully change your life, then the whole process will probably be a lot easier and it's more likely to go through.
Like if the business is good, you're gonna come off as a good borrower and a good potential business owner when you treat people well and you are on top of your stuff. So, um, rant over. So, um, I, I know we've only got a few more minutes, but, uh, could you maybe tell us some, some anonymized stories of deals gone wrong, uh, and, and what people could have done to mitigate that?
If there's anything that comes to mind in terms of how to avoid the deals falling apart,

Wendy: I don't know if they would apply to you. Um, because your gr your group is of a different caliber than, than some people. [01:17:00] Um, sometimes you, you have to work on things that are local to you, um, because they, they matter to the community and sometimes you have to work on things to kind of keep up an image and, um, when things fall apart, it's, it's generally 'cause somebody is like lying and your gut kind of tells you upfront that it's.
Probably not kosher, and then it ends up coming out at some point in the process. Um, let's see. I had a, I've got a, I've got a flower shop deal that's an expansion and it's a super simple kind of transaction, but, um, we discovered a whole bunch of affiliates from the buyer and these affiliates own property under LLCs that don't file tax returns.
And the buildings on the property [01:18:00] are washaterias, laundromats and other cash based businesses.
Um, so that just happened. Um, I'm trying to think of some other ones. I mean, I'm gotten, can I go on that 

Athena: point really quick? 'cause you said, you said lying, but, um, I think a lot of people feel like they need to, like, have answers for everything or try to gloss over where the problems might be. But correct me if I'm wrong, but it's much better if somebody comes soon and they're like, here's this wart and I'm concerned about it.
Here's what I'm thinking I'm gonna do about it. As opposed to trying to like gloss it over or be like, no, it's okay. Or, you know, variability in cash, for example. It's like, well, I can explain it and here's what I want to do to mitigate it versus trying to explain it over so it it, it feels like it's much better to disclose and talk about it and think of a solution rather than trying to gloss over it or withhold it.

Wendy: Yeah. Because it's gonna come out eventually. And would you rather [01:19:00] get it out of the way up front and either get a no and move on to a different deal, or would you rather spin your wheels through $15,000 with the due diligence to find out? That we find out about something and then we can't move forward.
So there's an ethics piece of this too, right? Like technically speaking that deal is still compliant, but knowing that this borrower has all these other businesses and he is not reporting earnings to the IRS as a character flaw, so we're not gonna move forward on that one. Um, I'm trying to think of some other ones.
We've had sellers back out the last minute because they just like decided, oh, I'm actually making more money than I thought. I just don't wanna sell anymore. Um, I had a deal right here in Houston, Texas, um, that had been around for 30 years and it's so unique that if I told you what it was, you'd go find it on Biz By Sell, so I can't, but it's very industrial and it had a bunch of bumps in the road, but the guy, um, buying it had $10 million of liquid cash [01:20:00] had built and sold two companies before I.
Has the bandwidth to the network, the CFO, the staff to plug and play and expand the living heck out of this company. And there was a significant downturn in revenues in 2024 that we underwrote around with a really creative seller note with a cash flow recapture. So it didn't hit my cash flow, but I could get the seller paid back in three years.
And it was just a really beautiful structure in my opinion. I had a lot of fun coming up with that. And then at the last minute, one of the three sellers decided, well, I know you've got the money, just pay me the full price. Let's forget the seller note. So I think what happened there is the buyer and the seller got a little too chummy and he figured out my buyer was really wealthy.
And then he was like, well, I'm just gonna pull out 'cause I know he's got the cash. And so my buyer was actually like, Wendy, I just can't pay more than I. The business valuation on this because it's got the [01:21:00] lumpy revenues. And he's like, what do you think? Should I just pay the cash and forget the seller note?
And I said, no. I mean, granted, I don't wanna lose a deal, but hell no, because you're gonna be miserable. You feel like you got taken for, that's an ethics issue. If you ask me if somebody gets you all the way through, the process knows that you spent money on a full blown quality earnings report, only to say at the 11th hour, oh, I know you got the money.
I don't wanna do a seller's note anymore. And then he played these games where he was like, well, you know, I'm probably gonna turn revenues around in 2025. I'll bring it back to market, but you're gonna have to pay me more for it. And I'm like. Wow, that personality characteristic just came through in live living color.
That's what you would've been dealing with during your transition 

Athena: and what you're buying, right? Like mm-hmm. That's, that's a, that's a culture that's of value that is gonna be ingrained in that business, potentially the team, you know, like they follow the leader. So, um, sounds like, [01:22:00] you know, good that it came out pretty close, even though it was lost revenue or lost, uh, expenses broken deal.
'cause like, what a nightmare. I, I can't imagine what that business would be like or the reputation it has or whatever if, if the owners pulling those kinds of things. So that's, yeah. 

Wendy: I'm, I'm really actually glad he pulled out. I don't want anybody to. Step into something just because they are afraid of losing another LOI Another deal, another closing.

Athena: Yeah. Um, it, it sounds like a good one to pull out of. So, you know, sometimes, sometimes the right thing to do is, is walk away from a deal, even if, if you're losing some expenses because it's a, it's a 10 year commitment, you know, you're with that business for the next 10 years, um, and, and you know, whatever legacy that, that seller left you.
So, um, I know we're coming up on time. Uh, really appreciate all your insights. I think this was hugely valuable to just kind of hear your perspective and behind the scenes and, and how you all [01:23:00] are evaluating things. I, I learned a lot actually today too, and took some notes. Um, so just real quick, what's, what's your kind of view on, what's your take on the market and the business buying landscape in 2025?

Wendy: I am so glad you asked because I'm super excited about all the rule changes, guys. Um, I am not kidding when I tell you that Athena has a track record with me and that her buyers are rated as a, in my CRM system, um, there is a specific type of individual that I seek out to work with and I'm glad that I've done so because the new rule changes are gonna eliminate a lot of buyers and a lot of searchers trying to put together these investment pools and take down all these companies.
Um, gone are the days where we're taking a Stanford MBA grad and pairing him with an investment firm, and he puts in no money into the deal. So we're looking for well qualified individual buyers that have the capacity, the [01:24:00] emotional intelligence, and the wherewithal to take down a company and manage a transition effectively.
So in my opinion, I think my life is about to get a lot easier. I think half of the BS buyers out on the market that are just wearing the hell out of these poor business brokers and people like me are about to go away. Um, I still have a lot coming in where they're trying to pitch investor deals to me.
Oh, I'm gonna do a seller note for half the equity, blah, blah, blah. I can't tell you how many deals I've killed very quickly within one email, probably in the past week. Um, and, uh, it's gonna take a, it's gonna take another month or two before the reality of the situation kicks in, but give it two to three months from now.
Um, next time you guys make an offer on something, you can confidently walk in and say, um, I am with a professional search firm and I have been pre-qualified by Live Oak Bank. Um, I am a very dedicated and very serious interested. [01:25:00] Self-funded buyer, I would like to have five minutes of your time. Let me tell you why I like this business.
And then provide them with an, a alternative choice for two meetings to follow up with you on. I can guarantee you you're gonna have much better feedback once the reality of the situation kicks in in a few months. 

Athena: Yes. Love that. The competition is getting less, right? So everybody here is in a really good place.
Um, and hopefully it, it makes just the landscape a little less crazy, right? Because I think deal price has been inflated as a result of these investment, you know, funds and, and like zero money in searchers and that sort of thing. So I love that. That's a great perspective and um, like really nice to hear that we're all as over here.
I. Might have been absolutely obsessed with getting A's as a student. So happy to hear that everybody here is getting A's. So that's awesome. Um, Wendy, you're uh, uh, a treasure. I really [01:26:00] appreciate you giving the time and the insight and um, uh, I think it was super useful. Um, we love working with you and, um, really excited to do more deals with you in 2025.
Thanks for taking the time today. Um, all welcome. We will be following up with you. You got a couple people that are circling deals right now, um, and signing LOIs. So, um, really excited to keep working together. Thank you again. Thanks for having me. Good seeing everybody. 

Anke: Good to see everyone. We'll see you next week.
Thank you. Take care. Bye.
