Call Date: 02/18/2025
Title: AcquiMatch Buyers Club

[00:01:20]
Athena: Welcome everyone. I wanted to call on a few of you to kind of see how it's going and see if there's some learnings for other folks in the group. But this is our kind of Tuesday's opportunity to chat, talk through challenges or anything that might be coming up with your deals. On Thursday, uh, so it's a super secret, but super amazing guest. And I don't want to announce them because they have the kind of schedule that we're just trying to make it work for Thursday. Um, we had someone else planned and unfortunately they had an issue, but if Thursday's guest is able to make it, uh, it's going to be a wild one, like, something you're not going to hear literally anywhere else in the universe. So, um, it's a personal friend that is like, anything to help your community. So fingers crossed we'll get that. I'm sorry I have to be a little like super secret about it, but, um, we'll hopefully have them. If not, then we'll just do more of this workshopping stuff. Hopefully I'll have some more, uh, news on the financial modeling template that we're working on there, too. So anyways, for today, I want to dig in, uh, on a few things. So, uh, Joe, I hope you don't mind me picking on you, but you've got an interesting situation on both the deal that you're working on and some other, maybe thinking about other opportunities, too. You want to fill us in where you're at?

[00:02:40]
Joe: Uh, sure. Um, I'm under LOI for the, uh, AC company. And, uh, still trying to get the initial list of financials from the seller so I can get to my lenders for their term sheets. So, um, a little bit of progress—had a call with Ryan here earlier today, just trying to get a couple of things organized. And I also set up a rhythm, kind of weekly call or meet-up point with the seller. We're going to try to do it every Thursday afternoon before this call. Hopefully that'll work. That's our first stab at it. So, um, at the latest, I'm talking with him at 3 o'clock on Thursday.

Athena: Amazing. Yeah, those weekly calls, I can't tell you how much of a difference that they make both because, you know, you're still in your W2 and like, they're running the business. So when you're not meeting regularly, it's easy to let things lose momentum and deals can die that way. So well done getting that scheduled. How are you feeling overall about the process? Now that you're under a signed LOI and moving forward on the next stuff.

[00:04:00]
Joe: I'm feeling okay about it. Just hope there's the same amount of urgency from the seller, which he claimed in our conversations he does have. Just so happened he also brought on 2 new employees, service techs as well, last week. So that's what took up his time. Uh, sounds like a good thing to give me a lot more—

Athena: What's that?

Joe: I said it took up his time and probably taking up a little bit of his mind share and getting me financial at least at the moment. So I'll stay on top of him on it. Um, so that is going seemingly well. What's up? Go ahead—question.

Athena: No, no, no, carry on and then I'll ask questions.

[00:04:50]
Joe: Okay. Um, and then it was last Thursday morning I had my first call with the seller of a different company. Uh, he's one of the two partners and what they do is it's a, it's a playground, astro turf and safety surface flooring distributor, uh, a little bit niche. They do a lot of their business through HOAs, county and municipal parks and rec. As you could imagine, they've done jobs for the Florida Aquarium, SeaWorld, Kennedy Space Center. So big names like huge ones—six-figure kind of size jobs all the way down to a few thousand dollars on their smallest job, where they happen to have a contract in place with a fairly large, I should say a very large fast food company. So a lot of times they don't see the product—if it's local enough or big enough, uh, they bring the equipment in kind of cross docking into their small location, the town was called Tarpon Springs, Florida. So it's about, it's just under an hour from my house. It'll be doable on the short term that I could look at relocating. But, uh, fast forward from that call, which went well on Thursday, to tomorrow: I have an onsite meeting with them, with both partners and the broker tomorrow morning at 10:30 and trying to hustle this deal up too. Okay, so you got—which one is making more sense and who's kind of acting quicker compared to the two—and kind of make a, uh, uh, frozen con sort of list and maybe make a decision if they keep lining up together. So, the idea is to get under hopefully in the next week's time, if, uh, the numbers are looking right,

Athena: Great, what's your gut telling you—

Joe: On that one?

Athena: Both or like, either or—I guess like, where's your gut kind of guiding you right now?

[00:06:50]
Joe: I'm trying to keep it 50/50 for fairness. I think if it's—I have a feeling one somehow may have surprises just based on numbers or just, I think, based on the odds of things. Um, so it's good to have options.

Athena: Absolutely. Yeah, I feel like a—

Joe: Week or two with it,

Athena: You know, and, uh, while it's not like the best feeling to propose to two different people. Especially when like the off-market stuff, they're kind of like, well, prove it to me or whatever. And we know that off market takes a lot of work to get it over the finish line because there isn't a broker involved. So, um, but also just testing, you know, is the original one still the one or is this one that's come back? I think it came—this is one that came back to you, right?

Joe: Yeah, they delisted for a bit, finished off the year—because they had a record year. Um, and then relisted it pretty quickly here at the year. So I was hoping they'd do that so I could evaluate it in time.

[00:08:00]
Athena: Yep, so, um, you know, when we have other opportunities and then doing that—the pluses and minuses, you know, and like, comparing them and looking at the return on investment and that sort of thing. It's great to have two in hand that you look at and then. Um, you know, how are you feeling—like, any qualms about putting two under offer from like a feeling-weird-about-it standpoint? Are you feeling good about doing that?

Joe: Um, yeah, I don't feel too weird about that. Um, knowing that I've been doing this for a while and I'm going to take any exclusivity and I can get to ensure that I make—I definitely do something. Yeah, I'm gonna be selfish here.

Athena: No, I think it's good—just before you walk too far on the lending—or you can even be transparent with the lenders and be like, I'm considering two right now.

Joe: Yeah.

Athena: Um, so, like, can you, like, let me know what the terms are because they might give you better terms on one than the other based on your experience or what the financials look like on the business or whatever. So, you know, transparency with them. So. Yeah, you know, like, obviously don't sign a term sheet or anything on anything until you make a decision on which one you want to go forward with. Um, but there might be things when you do get all the financials from the off market, for example, that they're like, oh, this is a big issue and going to cause funding issues or whatever. So you just don't know. And then, um, you know, on-market deals are competitive. So like, they're probably talking to other people. Um, you know, but also you can use that to put a little bit of a sense of urgency into your seller too. Right? So if he's not feeling like too motivated to get this done, just be like, hey, this is my timeline. And I will be looking at other opportunities if I get the sense that you're not, you know, going to follow through with this—in a nice way—but it's just like, hey, I've been doing this for a long time, this is my timeline, I want to get something done. I understand you're running a business too, but, like, I want to be the one running that business. But if you, you know, if you're not going to work with me to get this done, then I'm going to have to look at other opportunities just to make sure that I don't end up without a business. You've already got one.

[00:10:00]
Joe: Hope it doesn't come to that point.

Athena: No, but I think—

Joe: I think there's a way of—

Athena: Giving, you know, like, if you feel like he's dragging his feet and like, oh, I don't have time to do this. And it's like, hey, you know, you're not the only one I'm dating right now. So—

Joe: Oh, like, I have the other—

Athena: The other one.

Joe: I feel like, because it's being represented by a broker, the broker is going to want to keep his whole fee. And on that, I'm working with you guys who do not take that cut. Hopefully that would put me at an advantage compared to the competition. And also on the second one, one of the partners is looking to get out very quickly on a transition because he wants to travel and visit, I guess, his young family out in the UK. So he's from England. Um, so he's had a quick process in mind as well. That should help on the urgency on that one.

Athena: Yeah. And you know, a broker also is like likely just working on—like most of them just work on a success fee only model so they like don't get paid until it closes. So having an incentivized intermediary in the mix is—sometimes they can cause blocks and, you know, it is competitive—but also like they want to see a deal close as much as anyone, so you know you're getting both flavors now.

[00:11:50]
Joe: Yeah, so we will, uh—I think tomorrow should go well, uh, better and, uh, we'll learn a lot quickly with both—with everyone there at the office tomorrow.

Athena: Okay, cool. Um, so all good. Any challenges, any questions, anything we can help you with before you go into both meetings?

Joe: Actually, I don't think so. I think I'm getting some good repetitions on these meetings and the questions to ask. So, uh, I think you're good.

[00:12:10]
Athena: How's it going with the lenders on the one you do have under offer? How are those conversations going with lenders?

Joe: You said based on the A.C. company. Uh, they've all gotten back. I've had a phone call with them. They all had similar lists of what they're looking for, obviously on the financials. So there's nothing really to send them until I get everything at once because I don't want to split it all up and make it in two or three different emails to each lender. Okay. So, um, again, at latest then on Thursday, I'll be turning the heat up on the owner—or the, I'm sorry, the seller—for those documents.

Athena: Cool. Well, nice work. Keep us posted and obviously, you know where to reach us if you need any help. I might keep checking in on you since you've got a live one and another live one by the sounds of it.

Joe: Hopefully, yeah, thank you. Appreciate it.

[00:13:30]
Athena: Nice. Cool. Um, cool. So I wanted to chat, Polly. I know you guys are getting a little bit further than you've gotten at this point, talking about financial modeling and stuff. How's that all feeling?

Polly: Uh, the financial modeling is going well. Um, the last business that, uh, that we were doing the financial modeling on for really our first time around—it did not go through in the end, and, um, it's—it just wasn't the right business after all. There were a lot of things that we talked with Ryan about and just kind of came to the conclusion that it wasn't, uh, wasn't the business that it appeared to be, or that they were presenting it to be. So we're off to another one that we're working on right now. Really just kind of in the infancy. I'm going to have a call with a broker either tomorrow or Friday at the latest. So, um, that hopefully will possibly lead to something and we'll just see, but we're doing the modeling on that now and had some questions for Ryan. He's gotten back to, uh, to Steve on Slack. So we'll see how that goes. So we just keep—we keep moving forward.

[00:14:20]
Athena: That's amazing though. Like you're doing modeling on multiple businesses now. So what's the one that you have your eye on now?

Polly: It's actually a catering business, which is kind of interesting. So it's primarily—they do primarily weddings. I haven't had a chance to talk to the seller yet. The broker is actually—I talked to the broker today. Um, very nice and very, you know, just really wants—actually, she really wants me to talk to the seller or us to talk to the seller. So that's what she's trying to do, is to get an appointment worked out to where we can get a call scheduled with her. But, um, they were doing corporate events and they were doing some, um, uh, some weddings. Now they're almost solely focused on weddings and, uh, you know, there are just some questions like why the switch and, you know, trying to find out, you know, what—um, they say they have recurring revenue and they have contracts and you wouldn't necessarily have that with, you know, for weddings and that kind of thing. I mean, yeah, you would have signed a contract for them for that one particular event, but are they still doing corporate events and to what degree? What percentages corporate events—all of those things. I, I have a lot of questions for the owner, but it looks like a, you know, it looks like a good track record overall. Um, we're waiting on some financials, um, from August through the end of the year in '24. So that's the only piece that we're missing. Otherwise much cleaner financials than the last business we were looking at. And, uh, yeah. Easier to model and that kind of thing. As soon as we get the financials from August of '24 through the end of the year, we'll be set. We can model it correctly and get a good look at it.

[00:16:00]
Athena: Steve, how are you feeling about this one?

Steve: I love weddings. I'm like Mr. Wedding. I make so many friends at them. So I was like the OG wedding crafter. So yes, and I know Polly's laughing—she knows this is exactly true. I'll know everybody in the place by the time we leave. Um, so no, I think, you know, the biggest takeaway that I got is from going through the last exercise with Ryan and, you know, I think it's—it's kind of like one of those deals: you guys see it, but you gotta—it's got to make sense to yourself first, uh, before you actually believe it. And I think just taking a different approach to these businesses and starting with the financial modeling first, rather than the potential of the business or how cool is this business? It's more like, hey, do the numbers make sense? And if the numbers make sense, then let's go back into, you know, can we see— you know, can we see doing this business? Number one. Uh, number two, can we see opportunities to grow the business? But the numbers—if the numbers don't make sense, we will waste a lot of time on, you know, ideas rather than real action, because when you get to the action—like, holy crap, this sucks. So. That was my last week or two.

Athena: Yeah, I mean, and once you once you wrap your head around the model and figure out where to input things, it's pretty quick to be able to input things and then you got something where—I love numbers because they take emotion out of it, you know. It's like, I love numbers. It's just there, so it's like, okay, what happens if the revenue doesn't change? What happens if the revenue goes south? You know, like, what does that actually mean for us? Or what if we wanted—okay, we're talking about all these things that we want to do as a growth opportunity. If we put those numbers in and add those as reinvestment, is there actually enough? So, you know, we can get all excited about the potential of things, but the numbers tell a different story and allow you to just kind of, like, balance that against the excitement of the potential of it. Yeah, definitely. Um, so, uh, with the switch to weddings—did they indicate anything in the information so far as to why they did that, or that wasn't necessarily covered?

[00:18:20]
Polly: That wasn't covered. And I, I asked the broker that, but she said that really is, um, uh, you know, a question for the seller. So that's why she's trying to get the seller—the call scheduled with the seller for me. And, and, you know, if Steve's available, then obviously he'll be on that call too, but we'll make sure that both of us review our questions and everything. But, um, yeah, that's kind of an interesting thing to me, because corporate events, especially in this city, um, are big. Atlanta has a lot of corporate events. And, um, so it's just kind of interesting to me. I mean, you know, maybe it's a lot more lucrative to do the weddings. I, you know, I don't know what types of weddings they do—are they doing like high end? These are all questions, you know, that have to be asked. So,

Athena: Yeah. And also, do you have an idea of where their customers are coming from? Where the leads are coming from?

Polly: No,

Athena: We—

Polly: Don't. And, um, so the broker was extremely nice, but for some of those questions, which that was one of them, actually, um, she didn't have that information. So she didn't seem—she seemed like she really, really wanted me to talk to the seller. She didn't want to answer a lot of questions, which, you know, was kind of interesting because the brokers we've talked to in the past have been pretty knowledgeable overall of the business, where most questions have been answered. But with her, it seemed like she was a little reluctant.

[00:20:00]
Polly: So, um, I'm fine with doing a seller call. That's not a problem for me. And I, you know, I have, like I said, all these questions, but that was one of them that I asked her and she was like, I think that would be a better question for the seller. I was like, okay, so—

Athena: Two things I want to say. First, like Polly, you just said, I have no problem doing a seller call. Like, how cool is that? Do you feel confident jumping on the phone with sellers now?

Polly: Yeah, especially around something that I'm somewhat familiar with. Now, I've never been in the catering business, but I've been—I've set up events before and I used to go to trade shows. I used to have to go to, uh, to do events in the hospitality industry, small dinners to larger ones and coordinate catering and all that kind of stuff. So I have some mindset around that. So, again, you know, I think it's all with what you're comfortable with and that's something that I can at least have some sort of knowledge about—probably not near as in depth as, you know, what they do, but at least I have some knowledge around it. So I feel a little more confident in my questions and the types of questions I can come up with. Um, but yeah, I mean, I don't have a problem with talking to any seller as long as—if it's not something that I'm really familiar with—that I have those questions prepared and don't come off as though I'm hesitant in asking or whatever. So. Yeah.

[00:21:40]
Athena: I love it. Well, I mean, so between, you know, your Jason and events experience and Steve's excitement about this industry, like, those are really strong through lines. Right? Because if it's a—if it's a—something that excites you, and you love being a part of weddings—I love weddings. It's just like all happiness and just everybody's happy and it's awesome. You know. Um, so that's cool, but I just wanted to call you out on that because I like, you know, I know the confidence level is just like building, building, building. And sometimes I forget like how much things were, like, intimidating to us before and now you're like, I'm fine jumping on the phone with the seller and, like, we're doing financial modeling. And so just shouting you guys out because I'm really proud and you should take a moment to focus on how hard you've been working to get to this point.

Polly: It's getting a lot better because I was, um, I was hesitant in the beginning and that was just because it was all new to me. But I think, uh, definitely the financial modeling piece—I mean, we both work on that, but Steve really, he does a lot of that and then we go over it together. So it's not that I don't want to learn to plug those numbers in myself, but when we do it together, it makes more sense to me. So, um, from that perspective, yeah. I think it's really—I think it's been really helpful to do the modeling and to learn the modeling and I'm continuing to watch the same video over again until I get so sick of it I feel like I've learned it.

[00:23:00]
Athena: Amazing. Um, okay. So then the other thing I wanted to dig into is the broker and I think it's a good learning point for everyone. And something we can talk through here is there is no set way that brokers are supposed to represent deals and no set way in which brokers are supposed to know specific information or how they sell a business. So we get all shapes and sizes in terms of helpfulness or broker that understands the business or what their process is like. Some are like keeping their seller under lock and key. I just heard of one the other day that the seller isn't going to speak to anybody until after it's under—it's like, okay. Um, it's wild. Right? Because brokers are just doing whatever they feel is the right process. But when you have a broker like this, that is friendly and open and willing for you to develop a relationship with the seller, that's almost an ideal situation because then you don't have somebody that's gatekeeping you from developing a relationship with the seller, which can make things harder when you need to start negotiating, which will be at the point of LOI and then through the process after. So it's an ideal scenario that you have in this instance. It's like, well, the broker isn't as knowledgeable, but that's okay. They're not preventing you from going straight to the source. You know, they actually want you to go straight to the source, which is even better because then you get to develop that relationship. Now, what I would warn in this situation is we still don't want to skip the rapport-building first-date step. Right? So you don't want—because the broker is doing this now—it probably means that anyone that's interested in the business is getting on with the seller and they're grilling him on “I saw fluctuation in this number in year 2,” and like—remember, if we're going on a first date with someone, really the only thing we're trying to do is get enough information to decide if we want to go on a second date. And like, it feels frustrating because it's taking longer to get the information that you need to, but if it is genuinely a business that you really like and there's not a ton of competition—you know, so I don't know what the competition situation is, how many other buyers there are in the mix and how quickly you need to move—but if it's one of those that you have the time and can take the time, then that first seller meeting, you can ask questions in a way to get an understanding of the business without going, “Okay, I've got my list,” you know. And imagine in their situation—they hired a broker, broker is putting everybody on the phone with them, and people getting on the phone are just grilling the shit out of them. So you can actually set yourself up as the ideal buyer in the seller's mind by just getting to know them. Like, how did you start this business? Like, I love weddings—aren't they the best? Like, why did you get into weddings? I saw you recently moved into weddings and obviously I'm partial to them, but like—aren't corporate events—? You know, so you can have those questions in a way that's like actually building a relationship with them without getting too deep into grilling them on the numbers and that sort of thing. That makes them feel like, wow, you actually care about me and my business and I got to talk about it and I got to hear about you and I really like you. Then the next meeting is where you can start drilling down into, like, specifics that the broker didn't know—if you like the business. Right? You want to also figure out, like, do I like the owner? Do I like her vision and how she's built this business? Like, is this someone that I see myself working with? If so, then you can be like, hey, this was a great call. I have, like, more specific questions that are going to feel a bit like—you know, like, I love to do those in person if you can, if you're in the same area and the broker allows it. Then you can bring your list of questions and go and get to know them and ask the questions—or just do it as a second call and kind of prepare them for it: “Hey, we spent so much time getting to know each other. I actually have some more specific questions that I'd love to ask you. Are you up for another call where we can go into the nitty-gritty a little bit?” You know, and then they know it's coming and they like you and they're like, yeah, let's do that.

[00:27:20]
Polly: Yeah, there's a—there's an interesting—so there's one piece to this business is that the chef is willing to stay on for 6 months. And I asked the broker if that was negotiable, and she said it could possibly be negotiable that this person can stay on longer. And I'm thinking to myself with a catering business, I mean, you definitely want to have that quality of a chef if you're having to bring somebody else on—not that there aren't many of them out there and good ones—but, you know, those are things that can make or break the whole experience of catering. Obviously.

Athena: Absolutely, and I smell the performance-based note. Right? So, like, you don't have to bring that up now, but there's a key employee that's already made it clear that they're walking for the door. Then you can tie in, like, a performance-based note to this key employee either staying or the seller helping you get, like, a replacement for that person. You know, I don't know what the financials look like over the last couple of years, if there's any variability there too, um, but, you know, these things that are issues—there's ways to accommodate for them if you like the business, you know. So if you're like, I love this seller, I love this business, the model's solid, financials are good—you have this issue of the chef. Then we can figure that out in structuring and, like, ways to mitigate the risk there. So, um, you know, but getting the seller bought into the success after, you know—like, we can get them tied into that. It's like, hey, you're—we're not chefs and you're telling me your chef is also going to leave within 6 months. Like. Um, but a key employee—you know, for everyone, be aware, you're probably going to have a key employee walk when you take over the business. Right? So if we can, if we can upfront kind of account for that in the way that we structure it—or just know that it's probably going to happen because not everybody's going to love there being a new owner—and we protect ourselves in that process. Um, I love catering. So I don't, you know—hospitality-wise, perishable food, that whole thing is, you know, restaurants is not great, but what's great about catering is that you, you get them locked into a certain amount that they're paying for before you even walk in the door. So, typically you're paid up front. It's a headcount. It's something that as long as, you know, the chef and the team that are doing it are good at, like, you know, the ordering and portion controls and those whole things, um, then it's solid because you're paid up front for something that is typically perishable. And then, you know, if you have extra—uh, Jason, I don't think he's on today, but he works for Meals on Wheels. You both are in Atlanta. You know, like—like, I've heard really cool things of what catering companies do if there's like a lot of extra food leftover and that sort of thing. So you can almost build it into a little community exercise if they're not already doing that.

[00:30:40]
Polly: Yeah, that's a good point. A really good point. They, um, they apparently also do corporate meal planning, which is kind of interesting because I'm like—exactly what does that entail? But that's another call for another question for the seller because I asked that to the broker and she said, well, she probably can go into a little more detail with that because I don't know if that's something they do a lot of. It doesn't really say whether they do or don't, but certainly as their planning strategy for the future, that seems to be something they're looking at. So I just—I need to have a better understanding of what they're talking about with that.

Athena: Yeah, that's cool. So I think for this first meeting, like, write down all your questions and then brainstorm with Ryan how you can ask those in ways that are, like, building the relationship while giving you some visibility. So you might not get, like, exact—like, “Well, what percentage,” you know. It's asking for the same information, but doing it in a way that's not like putting them on the spot to, like, know their exact numbers or whatever, and be like, “Hey, so, um, I know you do, like, events and corporate meal planning and, like, weddings—like, you know, how are you dividing up your time between that? Or, what's that look like for the business?” Or, “Why did you decide to do all those different things?” Like, you know, so you can ask in a fun way that just shows that you're interested and gives you some visibility into it. Um, you know, and a lot of business owners don't actually know how to look at the different products that they have and to determine profitability. Right? Like, they just—somebody asked them to do something and they said yes. And so when you get a little bit deeper, they might not know the answer to “How profitable is each of these things?” and “What size of your revenue is each of these things?” and “What's the actual profit margin on each of these things?” But as you get closer into the numbers and develop a relationship with them, where you can kind of extract really that information—and/or you take it over and you realize, well, this one's a loss leader. So if we removed this and just focused on the things that we were good at, like, you know, that in itself could improve margins. So we want to be looking at it through that lens too. It's like, obviously if everything can't be changed, is it a business we want? And that's the first place that we always go in. But like with something like that, sometimes— and I worked in events for 25 years with a lot of catering companies too—like, I didn't actually work in catering companies, but with catering companies, a lot of them will just say yes to things without actually knowing how to calculate profitability and stuff. So you bring in some good visibility in terms of, like, looking at what are the costs of everything that they're doing and what are they good at. Um, and Steve, I can see you going in and selling these all day long. So we know that you've got, like, a strong sales— and Polly, with your events background. It sounds really exciting.

[00:33:20]
Polly: Yeah, well, we'll—uh, on the next call, maybe not Thursday, but next week—maybe we can give you a better update.

Athena: Yeah. Any questions or challenges that you're having in the meantime that you want to talk through today?

Polly: No, no, no, no, not—

Athena: Not for me. Steve?

Steve: No, no. So I'm kind of letting Polly run with this one. She has much better questions around it. That's just not my world. Like I said, I love showing up and eating the food and having a good time. But, uh, you know, the planning aspect of it—on that, I make it sound really easy—I'm not a detail person in that regard. So I kind of—this is what I'm trying to stay out of the way of and let Polly run with it. So that's a good thing. Yeah, I don't really have any questions. I keep breaking the spreadsheet on the financial model. So. Okay. Um, you know, it's—I'm getting better at it. So it's, uh, and things are looking more clear as you look at the modeling. Um, so anyway, yes, no questions for me.

[00:34:40]
Athena: Yeah, so on the modeling, um, we're working with, uh, some folks to create something that's a little bit more straightforward. But I think the cells in yellow are the ones that you can edit without breaking it. So, if you're editing cells that aren't in yellow or blue text, then that might be what's breaking it. Be—getting creative with the formulas and, you know—

Steve: You could actually change those other cells. I found that out.

Athena: Oh, I—

Steve: Yeah. They're—

Athena: Not locked.

Steve: No. I think I had Ryan's head spinning the other way, like, what are you doing to this spreadsheet? So, uh, but it's all good. It's been a great learning experience and I think—I'll go back to, I think the one aha moment is: let's start here, and if it makes sense, let's decide from there, instead of, oh, we love this, and then you waste a bunch of time—you have phone calls and this and that—you get into the model, you're like, this is never going to work.

[00:36:00]
Athena: That's a really good point, Steve, and something for other folks that are early in their search or about to start searching. You know, the quicker you can get up to speed with the modeling side of things, the easier it is to wrap your head around the aspects of the deal—whether it's going to work for you—and be also able to send out offers. So, like, you can wait until there's something that you want to put an offer on to start doing the modeling, or you can take every opportunity of every business that you're getting, plug those numbers in, get more familiar with financial modeling and get a sense of the numbers and get more comfortable with that. So then when you do find the one, you already know how to navigate all that. That's something that we see people get tripped up on a lot, um, which is one of the reasons why we're trying to make a more straightforward model. But even still, you have to understand the numbers, you know. Even if we give you a good template, being able to understand those numbers and how they flow and be able to explain that to lenders like Kevin was talking about in his session—like, they're going to ask you about these things. And how is this calculated? What's your projections? And, you know, all of those things. So I think it's a really good point, Steve.

Steve: Yeah, I'll add one more thing too—for me at least. Um, you can watch all the videos on how this works all day long, but until you actually start plugging numbers in yourself, it just doesn't make—it doesn't click. So even like Athena said, as far as—for me, again, we did—like, this particular one, an example, is the first one where even Polly said, let's run the numbers first before I even call the broker. So that was, you know, again, it was just a total mind shift on, you know, from our perspective.

[00:37:20]
Athena: I love that. I love that. We might steal that and encourage everybody else to do it because it does—the quicker you learn that stuff, the easier it is to go or no go. And, you know, part of looking at these deals is figuring out, like, does this feel right? Like, is this a good fit? And again, beyond just the emotional stuff—the emotional reaction to the things that we're seeing—the numbers tell a different story. So it's a good gut check and a good thing to just look—like, how does this feel, you know, from a numbers perspective? Love it. Well, cool. So when's the next—when's the seller meeting, Polly?

[00:38:00]
Polly: Hold on. Uh, so the broker said that she would like to try to set up something, um, tomorrow, possibly, or Friday. So we'll see. Uh, I gave her some time. She was going to check with the seller. And so we'll figure out if it's going to be tomorrow or Friday.

Athena: Amazing. Cool. That's exciting.

Polly: We'll let you know how it goes.

Athena: Yeah, I can't wait. This is awesome. I—I love events. I love weddings and just the two of you and how you are. I can see you being such a—like, you know, weddings have a certain personality type, and I see you being very good with those personality types, you know.

Polly: Thank you. Actually, our older daughter—now, she's—she works for a company here locally in Atlanta. They do strictly corporate events. So she's learning that whole industry too.

Athena: Was this the one—I remember you saying you wanted to potentially get one of your daughters involved in. I think she did marketing. Was that her or—

Polly: She does, yeah, she does. She did. That's her—you know, that's what her schooling has been in and so forth. So, yeah, creative media and marketing related. Uh, she worked for an advertising company for a short period of time, but she's working for this events company now. So who knows? Who knows what will happen from this.

Athena: Wow! A gang, family, wedding, corporate events, like—yes, love it.

[00:40:00]
Polly: Okay, cool. Thank you. And, uh, your encouraging words and some really good ideas. So, um, I'll get with Ryan before we have that broker call.

Athena: Yeah. Just remember first date, you know—I mean, it's like—

Polly: Call—seller call.

Athena: Yeah. Just remember first date. Like, you know, there's ways to ask questions on the first date without being like, “So how quickly do you want to have children? You know, I want to get married in the next year—like, how are you with that timeline?” So there's a way to, like, get the information without, like, you know, just making— And also it's harder, I know it's a lot harder on the sellers of those businesses, the actual owner, when the broker's kind of like, “Oh, you should talk to the seller.” Like it puts a lot of pressure on the owner themselves. So I almost say that—like, “Hey, have you had a lot of conversations with people? How's that feeling for you?” You know? Because it's like, if the broker's pushing people off to the owner, then the owner's probably having a lot more conversations than they might if the broker had been a lot more protective of them, you know. So,

Polly: Gotcha. Okay. Cool. All right. Thank you.

Athena: I will—

Polly: We will—

[00:41:00]
Athena: Awesome. Well, uh, that's everybody I was going to pick on today. Unless anyone else has some questions or things that you want to bring up, um, raise your hands if you do. In the meantime, I'll just give you a little preview of what's coming up on the, um, Buyers Clubs of the future. Um, so, like I said, on Thursday, um, if you are around, please join. We might—this is somebody that has a pretty chaotic schedule, but their story and their experience of buying a business and running a business is extraordinary. Um, and a good friend and, you know, a lot of this stuff has not been out there in the world. So I asked him after y'all told me it'd be great to hear from people that have been owning businesses for a while. Um, he was my first port of call. So, uh, he is going to try to join us on Thursday. We're going to get confirmation maybe very shortly before that, but even if we don't, we're going to have a backup session where we're going to do some topics and deep dives. Uh, if there's anything in particular that you want to talk about or learn more about, let us know. Um, then the following Thursday, uh, my other friend Nash, who acquired an auto repair business—um, it was a 6 million deal. He did a pari passu, had an amazing relationship with the owner, and he's about a year and a half into the business. And the way he approached the acquisition and also the way he's approached owning the business afterwards is pretty exceptional. Um, he's one of the people that I just—I'm in awe of—of how they approach things, of the resilience of their leadership, of how they took over the business. And even with all of that, he has had some wild things happen since he took over the business. Um, so he's going to come next Thursday and talk about his experience of being a year and a half into quite a sizable deal, um, with, you know, a need of skilled tradesmen and also, you know, a different level of employee than a lot of us are used to working with. Um, and then the following Thursday after that, our very own Andrew is going to come on and talk about commercial real estate. So, um, a lot of times you're going to have a business that you're looking at that is in a location, whether it's owned by the owner or not, and depending on whether the owner is selling it, or whether you're going to have to lease it, there's a lot of things that you need to understand about the real estate and the gotchas that can kind of come up when there is real estate involved in a deal. So that's going to be on the first Thursday in March—on the sixth, I believe—is going to be Andrew. And we're still lining up more people to come through. So we're trying to keep a rhythm where Tuesdays is where we do this. We talk through your deals, challenges that you're having. So feel free to come and bring things. If you ever want to, like, get up your financial model and actually just, like, work it with us—like, you know, y'all know that that's one of my sweet spots. The team are amazing at it too. But I love getting nerdy about the, um, the financial modeling. And then Thursdays are going to be more of the learning sessions where we bring in, uh, guests or experts, or we teach a deep dive on a topic ourselves. So, um, any topics or anything that anybody's like screaming out about—would love to learn more—that we haven't deep-dove into yet?

[00:44:50]
Athena: Feeling good. Okay. Awesome. Um, Steve, did I see you come off mute?

Steve: I just came off mute to say my head's just swimming with stuff. So, um, you know, everything you put up is great. So there's—the more I learn, the more topics you want to know more about. So,

Athena: Yeah, any—any others that have sprung up as a—I realize it's like a whack-a-mole situation, but is there anything that—

Steve: You said something a little bit earlier and—like, when you go to bring your financial model in and you get with the lender and then you're going to be challenged—so how do you defend your model? I can say right now I'm starting to understand the numbers and maybe it's going to be a time at some point it'll click too, because I can't tell you right now that without Ryan sitting next to me, I can't defend those numbers. So. That—that's probably just anything to get better at seeing, you know, um, how to defend the numbers and is something that I think about is going to be like my next level up is to be able to look at that and no matter who challenges, I can, you know, walk to every single cell and explain, this is how this was calculated and this is why.

[00:46:00]
Athena: I love that. I think it would be super useful for people. I'm actually thinking maybe I should have a lender come on and talk through—like, because the lender is going to go through the underwriting process. They're going to go through it with credit. So they're the ones kind of going through and like pushing your deal through, and they're getting pushback. So would it be useful to hear from their perspective—like what things they see that cause issues, what their underwriting team or their credit team are constantly questioning them on, or challenges that they get that they then have to come back to you and have you defend? Would that be cool to bring someone on to actually talk you through the lender mindset?

Steve: I think that's interesting. I think the other thing too is—explain it to me like you're explaining it to a kindergartner, because at the end of the day, as I go through these financial modeling sheets, it reminds me of how much I hated accounting classes in college. So, um, there's—nothing ever seems to add up the way I think it should because I missed something, or I made a mistake somewhere, and it's so precise. But again, just, you know, there's—you could start talking about, you know, cost of goods sold, you can start—all the accounting terms. But what does—because we're not, most of us are not accountants—but you're going into their world. So to understand it, uh, you know, rather than just memorizing the terms and what do they mean, what does it actually really mean?

[00:47:00]
Athena: I gotcha. That's a really great point. Um, so I'm picking on—you know, because you're chatting with me about it. And, um, you know, some people might be not as forthcoming—like, I've never looked at a balance sheet before and I don't actually know what it means. So, would it also be useful to go through the different types of financial statements like a kindergartner and explaining, like, what is a balance sheet and why do we even need it as part of this? And like, what are the things that we see in a P&L, or, you know—or are you guys feeling pretty confident about the different types of financial statements to review?

Polly: I could use it. I could definitely use it. I mean, I think that's just incredibly helpful in any way that you can break it down and make it—and simplify it as much as possible. Yes. For those of us who don't come from that background who can understand—who can understand it, but it's how it's presented a lot of times. So, yeah, I think it would be—I think it'd be really helpful.

[00:48:20]
Athena: Okay. Great. Yeah, we can absolutely do that. Um, you know, and most people here have not run a small business. So they, you know, worked in companies where they weren't necessarily, like, getting really deep on the P&Ls and the financial statements at a small business. So, yeah, this needs to run, um, and—like, I think there's a lot of empathy once you've run a small business and you understand those. So I think it's a really great point from both of you and how we can go through that.

Polly: Always worked for small—I mean, that's kind of been my career path—has always been with smaller companies. And so, from an operational standpoint, from sales all the way down to, like, project management and scheduling and all of that kind of thing. I had my hands on all of that, but I never had my hands in the financial piece of it because it was typically—it was the owner and it was outsourced. So that's where I never really—that's why I never got that education, if you will, on the financial side.

[00:49:40]
Athena: Yeah, most people haven't, right. Like I said, until you're in it. Yeah, while we're riffing on that too, I wonder if it might be cool to do a tax strategy session. Because I know a lot of people are like, they wrote all these things off on their taxes and like, actually, when you get deep into—and most people that are W2s, you don't have access to all of the things that you do to, like, pay less taxes. And like, our tax strategist was like, there's only 7 pages in the thousands of pages of the tax code that tell you what taxes you must pay and the other, like, 990-something pages are telling you how to save on taxes. So what feels like the owner is being dishonest and taking all these, like, tax savings and stuff is actually them just being really smart about their tax strategy and the tax code. And when I started understanding that, it's like, I like to see that in their financials, because it means they were thinking about those things. Um, but it can feel a little bit like, well, like, is this above board? Is this—so. Would that be a topic of interest—like tax strategy and what, what's kind of, you know, the common things that people are able to deduct on their taxes legally and what's some of the more advanced strategies that we're seeing people do that you should be aware of? Do you like anything like that?

Steve: 100%. And, and also even understanding it enough because not all accountants are created equal either. Um, you know, I've seen—I've had conversations with, you know, with folks like, yeah, so-and-so's business, they get to write off this. Why don't I write off that? And you gotta—you almost have to challenge your accountant to say, why aren't we doing this when we're hearing this? So to understand what's reality out there, number one, you know. Otherwise I got a box of receipts I'm not sure what to do with. Um, and, you know—and then to your other point too about small business—because like looking at a 10-K of Coca-Cola, you know, is very different than looking at a, you know, a P&L of a small business. What's important to the small business might not be so important to the, you know, 40 billion, 50 billion a year business. And just—so again, so it relates to our world, you know, what should we be looking for that really stands out that's, you know—here. Or example, uh, I look at—we used to get to a certain size of company, things like healthcare—I mean, can you switch the plan and find built-in savings or profits based on you're like, man, that's a crappy plan. I know you can go here and get—and move it over to here, you could save—give people better healthcare and save money, because that person just had it for 20 years and they were lazy about, you know, paying up. So just things like that. You know, again, that's—just as you said—the more I learn, the more I want to learn and the more I realize I don't know.

[00:52:40]
Athena: Yeah, you're learning two skill sets at once—how to buy a business and then how to be a business owner. And, you know, a lot of what we can learn in how to buy a business—like, if we're analyzing like, hey, they did that on their taxes—but also, what are all the tax-advantaged strategies that I can do when I take over this business? If I know those in advance, and I can start applying those when I take it over, I know what good looks like in terms of hiring. I cannot tell you how many accountants, CPAs—people that file taxes—that literally just file taxes. They do not give you strategy. They don't tell you how to save on your taxes. And the ones that are good on it—they're expensive and it's a hell of a lot of work—so much work to do all of it, but it can save you a ton of money. And especially if there's real estate involved, and there's so many opportunities to keep more of what you make. And I think people aren't looking at that enough, especially when you're the business owner and you're able to have control of it. So knowing, you know, when we look at the tax returns of current owner—what's normal versus what is bad. Right? And then, what can we be thinking about that we can squeeze more money out of what's already there when we take it over. We don't have to tell them that, but it's like, man, if they applied the Augusta Rule, or if they applied one of these strategies, or if they were able to do this, then it's like—that's, you know, tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands more in your pocket when you take it over and you're running it annually.

[00:54:00]
Justin: I'll—just to chime in on that—I'll echo my interest in that. Specifically, I've interviewed a number of accounts that we're looking for for ourselves in my way of small business and you're spot on. I mean, there are tax preparers and then there are true tax strategists for small business who understand, you know, the different advantages that can be taken. I would love to learn more about that because there's so much I don't—it's like, I don't know what I don't know. So I'd love to hear from somebody who operates with expertise in that space to really get more information. I think that would be incredibly—well, for me, I'll speak for myself—that would be incredibly interesting.

[00:54:40]
Athena: If all of us are going to be business owners, then all of us need to pay attention to it. Because it's like, what's the point of making all that money if you don't get to keep it? You know, and also, I think it just gives you a lot of, like, visibility when you're looking at the tax returns—like somebody that's using some of these tactics, it's like, that's a smart business owner because they're thinking about their bottom line. They're thinking about their take-home as opposed to just, you know, making a bunch of money and not thinking about how am I optimizing this. So, yeah, I'm glad to hear that you're also interested in that, Justin. I am personally kind of obsessed with it because, you know, I'm living in the US again after 12 years away and I'm like—no. Like, but, you know, it's interesting the mindset that we get in. It feels like it's being—like bad to want to save money on taxes when it's like, the tax code is really literally written for you to save money on taxes. Most people aren't learning it and taking advantage of it, including the people that are supposed to help us do that. They're just—what were your expenses? Okay, you know, like, let me add some numbers in the boxes. And it's not—it's not good enough. So, um, yeah, there's things that we can do absolutely to save. And if we're taking over a business, then we want to know those things going into it because a lot of this stuff, you have to kind of, like, get ahead of it. Um, cool. Good stuff. Awesome. Well, uh, some cool topics to touch on. And there's, like, endless amounts of topics. So, as always, if there's anything that you're not comfortable saying here that you would love to learn about, like, let the team know, let me know. We want to, you know, not just take up your time. We want this to be useful and help you on your journey and help you be able to, like, buy and take over businesses quicker and more successfully. So whatever we can do to help you there, let us know. Uh, like I said, next Thursday—I'm sorry, I have to be all incognito about it. I'm getting this person on one way or another. We're just hoping it's going to be for Thursday. So, um, stay tuned. Come on. If not, then we'll touch on one of these other topics. So either way, we'll make it useful for you to join us on Thursday. Um, have a great time in the meantime, good luck on the people working on deals. And then I've seen some of the stuff coming through the tracks for those of you that are newer into your search—some exciting stuff happening. So thank you all so much. We'll see you next time on Thursday. Have a great week in the meantime.
