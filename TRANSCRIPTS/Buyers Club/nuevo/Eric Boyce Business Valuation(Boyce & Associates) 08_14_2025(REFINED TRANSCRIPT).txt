[00:00:00]
Athena (AcquiMatch): In the meantime, I will start kicking off today's session, which I am super excited about. I have known Eric since, gosh, like very early in my search journey. He is a local to me here in Austin and has been a really amazing, like warm, supportive energy when I was asking a lot of questions. And then we started realizing that we both shared a love for businesses and entrepreneurship. I was a lecturer at the university, so Eric does a whole ton of mentorship and amazing stuff locally with businesses and everything as well.

In addition to that is a veritable resource of so much good information and experience around both business valuations and wealth management. So we've actually got a part two that we're gonna be doing on September 4th for Buyers Club, which is wealth management for new business owners. But today is gonna be all about valuations and he's brought Tom, who is the chief business appraiser over at their company. So I'm gonna hand over to the two of you. We’re so excited to have you have this conversation today. We are gonna get so much great information about business valuations. I got to preview the slides and I'm super excited for this conversation. So thank you so much for being here. Please, do a quick intro on yourselves, if you don't mind.

[00:02:00]
Eric (Voice and Associates Wealth Consulting): Sure, sure. Uh, well thank you. First of all, I don't know if I can live up to that wonderful intro that you made for us, but, uh, no, it's been a real pleasure to get to know you and, and, uh, you know, and I, as we were talking here recently and kind of sharing your vision for, you know, what you're trying to do with AcquiMatch. I think it has a perfect place in the ecosystem for business acquisition as we know that there's gonna be trillions of dollars of wealth transfer over the coming years because of demographics, you know, because of a lot of reasons.

And, uh, you know, I think, you know, just by way of background, you can see in my background here that I'm CEO and founder of Voice and Associates Wealth Consulting. And we started the valuation practice because we were working with a lot of business owners and, and frankly, a lot of owners that had sold their businesses and they hadn't achieved their goals. And they were, you know, kind of left, you know, kind of like wondering in some sorts, you know, what could have been.

So we, I took a totally different view on wealth management and said, well, okay, well, how can we address—without being Accenture, KPMG or some type of management consultant—how can we address the value of the enterprise, which is the most important asset that I think probably a lot of you either have already or are going to have, and how do we address that value and address anchors to that value while you're still in the business? So you at some point down the road can achieve a better exit. And so that was really the genesis of this. And like I said, I've known Tom for, you know, 22, 23 years, and Tom is, uh, uh, he's a—I'll let him mention his credentials, but, you know, we'll cover that in the presentation.

Uh, he's a credentialed business appraiser. We do certified business appraisals. And he's my chief business appraiser. So, um, you know, my background is investments and financial planning, but primarily investments. And I've worked with a lot of high net worth individuals. I've worked with a lot of business owners, which to me—and, you know, I guess this will save some time in the presentation—but, you know, over the years and through a pandemic or two, you know, have seen some of the pitfalls that people live and they get stuck in the moment and they get stuck in the day to day that they kind of lose sight of the big picture and the long-term planning and things like that.

And so, uh, I've made it a real personal, I think, crusade of sorts to try to help educate or at least just bring light to some of the things that I know can add value to an enterprise. So that's hopefully what we can achieve here today. And uh, and I know that there's, uh, just, you know, just as an aside, I think Athena alluded to this, but in some of the areas that we'll maybe just barely hit on today that we won't get real deep into are kind of like the characteristics of the high performing—and we can do a whole—high performing enterprises. We've got a whole presentation on that and then contingency planning, and then who's on your team. And the other things that I don't have in this particular presentation today, but kind of a deeper dive on perceptions of small business and then effective entity structure, which obviously we could schedule more time to do that, but I'll let—

[00:05:00]
Athena (AcquiMatch): More topics for Buyers Club.

[00:06:00]
Eric (Voice and Associates Wealth Consulting): That's all right. I was just gonna let Tom introduce himself just very briefly and then, uh, and then we'll go ahead and jump into it.

[00:06:06]
Tom (Voice and Associates Wealth Consulting): Good afternoon and thanks for having us, Athena. Um, actually Eric and I have worked at three businesses together, although we weren't aware of each other at the same time. We both were working for Bank of America in Dallas in the nineties, and that was where I first started doing business valuations. I was in the trust department and we had to satisfy what's called Reg 9, which was to value not publicly traded financial instruments that were held in trust accounts so that you could have an accurate fee assessment. And, um, rollercoaster brought me to Austin. Eric and I started working together for another wealth manager. Mostly, uh, that was publicly traded securities. And then many years later, we decided to get together and I started doing business valuations with Eric in 2019.

And so I, along the way, I earned the CFA credential, Chartered Financial Analyst, and then more recently earned the CVA, which is a Certified Valuation Analyst issued by NACVA, which is specifically for business valuations. And I looked it up. I consider the CVA to be the premier credential. There is an ASA; there are a couple of other credentials that have kind of either been purchased by NACVA and are no longer active. But there are, as of last year, there are forty six hundred and thirty three of us. So there's not that many to give you a top quality business valuation.

[00:08:00]
Eric (Voice and Associates Wealth Consulting): Well, thank you Tom. That brings me up to date. Yeah. Well, Athena, thanks again very much, and really appreciate this opportunity. This is great to be with all of you. Again, we'll kind of go through the presentation and I'm sure along the way you'll have some questions and you can save all the hard ones for Tom. I'll take all the easy ones. No, I'm just kidding. But, you know, we'll be glad to set aside some time and I'll have, uh, at the end there'll be, uh, kind of our contact information if we could be a further resource to you.

But, um, today, I think what Athena and I talked about doing—first of all, you can all see my screen right? Okay, perfect—is we wanted to talk about the fundamentals of business valuation, and so there's lots of different components to that. So we'll kind of cover those and then we will kind of dig in a little bit to what we call the five pillars of value and kind of go through each one. And some will seem rather intuitive to you and some may not seem terribly intuitive. But, uh, we'll go ahead and start with the presentation. If I can get my—hold on—if I can get my… There we go. Working now. Okay. We'll make the lawyers happy with this slide.

So let's start with some basic data on small business. I thought this would be a good backdrop because small business really does drive this country and, you know, there's a lot of companies that make the headlines, but it really is small business and particularly in this kind of two to $10 million range that really kind of drive our economy. And, you know, and obviously in my other hat that I wear, which is on the wealth management side, I'm kind of a closet economist and spend a lot of time in the data. And we know that— and I put some of these statistics here—we got 33 million small businesses and we know how important it is to the economy that small business creates a lot of jobs. In fact, a lot more jobs than the large companies do, and small business employs essentially half of the private sector workforce.

And so I think as we go along, you'll see, you know, with the backdrop of what I said earlier about all of this wealth transfer that's on the horizon, that it's gonna be very important to have accurate or reasonable and relevant valuations for enterprises. And not just for the transfer of that wealth, but also as you—as like, you know, aspiring new business owners—and growing your wealth and growing the enterprise. And I think that to me, I think if you walk away with anything today, it is not just, you know, we're not just here to talk about get a valuation when you sell it down the road, but also using valuations and using a third party to help maybe benchmark your progress. And you'll hear that a couple of times here today.

So, just a quick note on kind of the pitfalls. And we see this a lot: the failure rate for small businesses is unfortunately very high. And you can see that two thirds of businesses—and this really relates more to kind of, you know, startup businesses—and the failure rate is exceptionally high when you get out to five, in particular 10 years. And so, you know, I have yearned to understand, okay, why is that? And a lot of it is, again, living in the moment and not doing planning, not doing budgeting, forecasting, contingency planning, which you'll hear more about here later on. And these will all tie back into what are your anchors to value. You know, there are a lot of drivers of value that may be more obvious, maybe more intuitive, that you'll celebrate. But then, you know, I wanted you to leave today with kind of a thought of what are the anchors, potential anchors to value that as I transition into becoming an owner of a business that I should be paying attention to. So, hopefully, you'll take some of that away.

A quick note—and I think this is all something that was laid bare during the pandemic. You know, I had the opportunity as part of, you know, the city of Cedar Park up here in our chamber of commerce to do pandemic assistance grants to companies that had applied for PPP. And I knew some of this already, but honestly it was really laid bare that people aren't doing contingency planning. They're certainly not looking at transition planning down the road, which I know is not really a topic for today's conversation. But, you know, when you're doing contingency planning, you're doing risk analysis, you know, even if you're doing it, oftentimes business owners aren't sharing it with key staff. And so, uh, you know, there's a lot of risk that builds up. And, you know, a lot of people, frankly, don't do budgeting. We see that a lot in our valuation work. And you can see the statistics here are very compelling.

And, you know, when you think about these things, I mean, obviously no one can plan for a pandemic. It's very hard to do that. But there are clearly things that we'll talk about as we get through the presentation that you should be aware of and should be thinking kind of in a 360-degree realm about. And as we get down towards the bottom bullets here, I just say that, you know, there's a lot to this that pertains to you as the owner. And when you think about this, the owner—and this is one of the key pillars of value—is the owner psychology. What's going on with the owner from their own personal side or their own personal risk control or planning or whatnot—it has a tremendous bearing on the value of the enterprise. And so you can see here that a lot of owners don't have a will and they haven't really started planning. And there's, you know, there's not, you know, they don't have buy-sell insurance, they don't have key person insurance. You know, they're not thinking about risk like they should. And that can create a potential existential risk to the overall enterprise.

So I thought, you know, we'd take some time and just go through the fundamentals of business valuation. So apologies to any of you out there that, you know, maybe have been through or know somebody that's been through a valuation. But, you know, we'll just kind of hit on these and obviously take questions at the end. But I want to—hopefully we will dispel some of these myths. And I think the intrusive part of this is something that we hear a lot: you have to be—not vulnerable to extent—but you have to be open and you have to share data that's important to an evaluator in terms of contingencies and whatnot. And, you know, a lot of business owners, when we do our work, we've got to recast a lot of the financials 'cause there's a lot of personal expenses that are being run through. And I think a lot of people feel a little untoward perhaps towards that. But, you know, I think these are myths.

It doesn't have to be expensive when you think about it in terms of it being an investment in the ability for you to track and measure your growth. Time consuming certainly doesn't have to be. And then, like I said, intrusive—it is a standardized process and, you know, we don't want any more information than we need to do our work.

There are a lot of reasons why business valuations are needed and done, and I put in italics here the ones that we probably see more often than not. I'd say at the top, clearly transactions—whether it's a full sale, it's a partner buy-in, partner buyout, financing. I know a lot of you—and I talked to Athena—about SBA valuation or SBA loan valuations and the triggers at which that becomes a necessary thing. So we certainly do that. We work with a lot of banks. Litigation—and it's unfortunate—but we do see business and personal divorce situations and, not so much on the fraud side, but we've seen some pretty uncanny financials. I'll just leave it at that. But litigation is another reason why we get called in to do that.

And finally, down on the—you can see here some of these other ones—intellectual property is quite nuanced in terms of the skill required to value IP. But down at the bottom, you see some things that kind of pertain more towards business growth and future growth. And also from a personal standpoint, what you'll hear me talk about time and time again: it's really important, you know, from a planning standpoint. And one of the reasons why it was important to me to do valuation was we spent a lot of time working with people that had sold businesses, like I said, that didn't accomplish their goal. And, you know, a lot of people come to us and say, well, I've got a business that accounts for a big chunk of my net worth, but I think it's worth, you know, $5 million, but I don't really know why. And, you know, you think about like, you know, the quality of information in drives the quality of information out. And so if you're planning your own retirement, your own exit down again down the road—'cause I know most of you are just getting involved—

[00:17:00]
Athena (AcquiMatch): Just—

Eric (Voice and Associates Wealth Consulting): Just getting started. But, you know, as you go down the road, I think it's gonna be increasingly important for you to know what that value is because it helps you in your own personal planning, and then, like I said, for benchmarking business growth and so on and so forth.

What a third-party valuation really does at its most basic level is it takes the emotion out of it. Again, there are standards that are applied, and it's unbiased. I mean, we don't have any, you know, dog in the hunt, so to speak. You know, we're looking at it from a very objective point of view, and we're not only providing a number. A lot of appraisers will just provide you a number and a report and say, have a nice day. I think because we started our valuation practice, it was born out of wealth management and working with owners, that, you know, we tend to be a lot more consultative and trying to provide you feedback regarding what you should be celebrating and also what you should be perhaps working on to help drive your value up. You get a lot of peer group analysis, kind of like understand where you sit within your particular industry group. And so there's a lot of data that we look at there. And then, obviously as a planning tool—and maybe exit planning is not the right word here—but certainly a planning tool to kind of get an unbiased opinion as to maybe the quality—some quality elements related to your operations. And if you identify some of these anchors to value, it provides things that you can work on in your business.

And then I'll just leave it at that. And then Tom hit on this earlier, but it's important to have some rigor in the process. And again, standards of practice. And this is—you know, the CVA and the CFA are just two of several key credentials. I would also argue with Tom that the CVA is certainly one of the more important ones. But NACVA here—as Tom mentioned—is our sanctioning body, and then they oversee the uniform standards. But, again, it's the rigor that's applied to valuations there.

Now, there are a lot of people out there that will advertise, give me five pieces of data and I'll give you a number. Well, that's not a valuation, and it's certainly not a certified valuation. As you'll see, as we talk about the different levels of reports, there is a very deep and systemic—or systematic—approach that certified appraisers will use in valuing a business.

So we'll talk about each of these in isolation briefly, but there are really three approaches to value. And they’re individually relevant, and again, depending on the nature of the industry, some of these are more relevant than others. But I'd say that most of these are fairly intuitive and some report levels will only focus on one and some report levels that are more comprehensive will look at all three.

So we'll start with the income approach. And so this really—when you think about the income approach, think about financials and the analysis of trends and analysis of the data that is knowable. And so, you think about past and projected future profitability. I mean, we'll look at whatever budgets or pro formas are available. You know, that's not knowable data yet. So we will focus on what is known in the history of the business. And we'll use that within the income approach. We'll use all that data to derive some of these boldfaced things like seller's discretionary earnings and EBITDA, and we'll use those as the fulcrum points on which we can calculate values. And so in any one particular project that we do—encompassing all three approaches—you could have anywhere between like three or four and like 10 or 12 different individual calculations of value. And then what we do as appraisers is go in and weight those as to how important we feel that they are in helping to really tell the story of value. But the income approach tends to work best if you have a profitable business with a strong track record and very strong financials and a consistent business model.

So the market approach is probably what you would think. I mean, it's looking at comparable transactions. The real art in the market approach from an appraiser's point of view is determining which comps are most relevant. And when you think about the different screens that you would have—are they geographically relevant? Are they relevant in size to my particular company? Are they relevant in location? And oftentimes we find certain projects—say like dental practices as an example—where there's a lot of comparable transactions to draw from. And so it's really easy to drill down to a comp set. But then there are others that have more nuanced business models that are a lot, lot more challenging, 'cause there really, in many respects, aren't comparables to speak of. But we'll look at the industry codes and we will do our best to try to come up with comparable transactions to judge our opinions on.

And then the asset or the cost approach really speaks more to the balance sheet. It's looking at net assets. And there's elements within this particular approach that require kind of a nuanced capability—like if you're, say, a business that carries inventory or has a high degree of asset intensity, and you have a lot of property, plant and equipment. We don't do specific equipment appraisal. There are people that will do that. There are people that will come in and value inventory, per se. So within this sleeve there's some specialization here, but again it's just looking at net assets and coming up with a value based on that.

So the premise of value—I know it's a lot of word soup on this page—but it really goes to what, i.e., under what circumstances are we doing this valuation? And, you know, more often than not, it's going to be based on the presumption that it's a going concern. You know, there are cases where you know that there's existential risk to the enterprise, and so we have to look at it through maybe a slightly different lens. And then, you know, liquidation comes in the form of, you know, like when you talk about turnarounds and things like that. But more often than not, we're going to establish the going concern as a premise of value and as a premise under which we are going to construct our valuation thesis.

Talk about snapshot versus conclusion of value. You know, snapshot—if you think about it this way—a snapshot is like putting numbers through a hose and into a system, and then you're analyzing the numbers and then you're providing an output of value based on those numbers. So it's very quantitative and a snapshot by its nature is less intensive, less comprehensive, and certainly less costly than a conclusion would be. And you see here that a snapshot will use one of those three approaches to value, whereas a conclusion is inherently much more qualitative and quantitative and it will look at all three of those. And so there is a range again of project intensity that you could look at.

Now, like I said, snapshot is a limited scope valuation, and again, the conclusion really is more of an opinion of value. And this is where I think the skill of the appraiser comes into play because they're going to analyze your business model, your competitive moat, they're gonna analyze maybe the regional economy within which you're operating. And it's gonna provide a much deeper analysis. And so snapshot is good for, you know, if you're benchmarking progress to your strategic plan. It's good if you have a relatively small enterprise, and it's good for that benchmarking, which we've been talking about. Now a conclusion—in any instance where you're dealing with like, call it a partner buy-in or an investor buy-in—and there's a legal contract that codifies that transaction that could be subject to dispute in a court of law, or if there's anything that could fall under scrutiny by the IRS, you want to have that robustness that's provided within that conclusion of value.

Information that we need is fairly straightforward—basically years of financials, internal financials, tax returns to the extent that they're possible. You know, this is not anything that you haven't, I guess, in your own individual journeys already come across in terms of your due diligence. But interim financial statements—like say for now, sitting here in August—we would certainly want to have some interim financials through June if we were doing a project with a current valuation date. And then, as I said before, we'll take whatever data is offered to us in the way of forecast, budgets, strategic plans. Most people don't have that data. Against that, the soft data that you see down below can be fairly detailed, but obviously when you're looking at compensation relative to the industry group or turnover of employees and what types of benefits are being offered versus the competitive landscape, and honestly contingent liabilities and/or contingent assets are all very helpful for us to know. But it's clear that in a lot of cases we just don't have access to that 'cause it's either not available or not being provided to us.

[00:29:00]
Eric (Voice and Associates Wealth Consulting): So I wanna talk about value drivers and anchors, and then we'll kind of finish up with the five pillars. So we'll talk about first the internal value drivers, and these are the things that you can control. And you see this list here. And, you know, I'll tell you from an evaluator's perspective—and Tom would tell you this too—that the number one thing that you can control here is the integrity of the financial statements. When we were doing pandemic assistance to smaller businesses—businesses over $2 million—when we asked them to provide financial statements, they took a cell phone photo of the front page of their bank statement and called it their financial statement. And so, you know, it goes to what type of platform are you using? Are you using, you know, a bookkeeper, QuickBooks, so on and so forth. You can control kind of like your financial condition, certainly the culture and the soft things. Employee satisfaction, stability are things that you can address as a business owner. A lot of times we see either a key customer risk or a key person risk—like somebody you can't afford to lose—and you're not necessarily looking at locking that person down through some type of a competitive package or through some type of incentive program to advance their growth. And then, you know, you can see down here product/service strengths. I mean, obviously you control your product or service. And then the owner, the management risk that we'll talk about a little bit as it relates to culture.

The things now that you can't control—you know, we can't set tax policy. Obviously we're not in charge of setting short-term interest rates. And these are just economic, macro, cyclical drivers that we have to at least recognize exist, particularly economic cyclicality, and we have to prepare accordingly. Position within the industry lifecycle—I mean, if you're not like 360-degree aware of your operating environment, like think of Blockbuster Video. I mean, that was a terrifically valued company until it wasn't. And it was made obsolete very, very quickly because the industry lifecycle turned on a dime. And so market share and position—I guess you could argue that maybe you could influence that, but obviously you can't control competitors that enter your market space. I mean, that's up to them. You can react to it. But again, you can't control who's gonna compete against you. It's how you react to it that's most important.

Just some additional factors—I think this in itself is pretty intuitive. A lot of people have intangible assets that don't really even know it. And I've used the dental practice or the architectural practice—that you have a lot of intellectual capital, maybe some goodwill—but your customer base. A lot of people don't realize that a very stable, revenue-producing customer base has a lot of value. And unfortunately we've heard some service business professionals that say, well, when I'm ready to hang it up, I'll just close the business. Well, there's value potentially that you're leaving on the table there because it does have value. And in some cases if you have kind of a unique process, that has value too.

I was talking to somebody—a good friend of mine—just earlier this week whose father is in his eighties now, and he runs a food distribution business in Chicago and has recipes that have been handed down through generations. And there’s a contract—somebody that works with them that does contract production of barbecue sauces. And, you know, she didn't realize that that had some intrinsic value to it. And so again, value comes in a lot of different ways and that's just one. Obviously fast-growing businesses tend to be more highly valued. And then the other two—location and financial health—are pretty intuitive and we've kind of covered that a little bit.

So let's talk about the five pillars of value, and then we'll close with maybe a call to action for you as you enter your journey of business ownership, and then we will certainly have time for questions. These are the five pillars. And this is a byproduct of talking to a lot of business owners—people who have sold businesses, people who have brokered businesses, people that have advised businesses. And, you know, the top three probably are very intuitive. The bottom two are fuzzy, right? And then I'll emphasize when we get down to owner readiness or owner psychology, just how important it is for businesses that are under $10 million. But we'll take each of these individually.

When you think about sales—I mean, really, sales is the mother's milk of everything that is a company. You can't pay salaries, you can't pay rent, you don't have profits unless you have sales. And so when we're looking at companies and we're doing that deep dive, you know, we want to understand, you know, what does that competitive landscape look like and where is the company and the industry? How do they differentiate themselves from the competition and what do they articulate as their value proposition? And then do they have a strategy with regard to sales? Do they use a CRM? Do they have a tracking mechanism? Are they accountable? Do they have KPIs, key performance indicators, that they're looking at? And, you know, as I said, metrics and dashboard assessment—are they actually assessing that? You know, and we encounter a lot of clients that have sales concentration and they rely on maybe two or three clients. And that's great—it's easy, doesn't require necessarily a lot of work. But what happens if one of those goes away? And, you know, you think about the risk on your own, looking in the mirror and assessing your own business risk—it's almost impossible to look at what are the contingent existential risks that exist with some of your customers too, right, that could go away in an instant. And where does that leave you? So, differentiating yourself and also having a strategy to expand and diversify your customer base is really super important to the ability to help drive value.

Next, we have financial controls. Again, I'd say time and time again, it's just like we see so many instances where, you know, the financial controls are lacking or there's a discrepancy that is hard to reconcile between what's being reported for tax purposes and what's being reported on the internal financials. And as I've already kind of alluded to, there's a lot of people that really don't think about accounting policies and they don't have internal controls. And a lot of people, you know, while they may use QuickBooks for sales, they tell us that they keep all their expenses on a spreadsheet, and then they send both of them up to their CPA and the CPA has to forensically put all that stuff together. But there are a lot of business owners that, you know, have a real—I call it like a visceral attachment—to the business model, but they don't have a background in finance or accounting. And so this kind of speaks a little bit to who you should have on your team. And, you know, financial controls is something that—it's probably from an appraiser standpoint—one of the most easily identifiable anchors to value if you don't have it. And it's not to say that you've gotta be using QuickBooks to have value, but it's just like how you approach this whole financial function—that's really, really important. And a lot of people aren't really—certainly if you're not running good internal financial data—then you're not able to analyze that data and identify trends.

Again, we go back to the pandemic. Pandemic's a pretty obtuse example, but oftentimes you will go down that rabbit trail if you're not analyzing financial metrics. Over time, it's easy to get lost in things that are, you know, like the kind of the rotting apple that's sitting in the basket, and then you don't see it because you're not analyzing the data and all of a sudden you get to a point where it may be existential and you've gotta deal with it in the moment. But, you know, again, if you're looking at financial ratios and metrics on an active basis, you can look at and you can identify trends that may be adverse that you can address.

Operations—I'd say over the last 20 years you can bifurcate this into the core operations side as well as the human capital side. Operations, depending on your industry—if you're manufacturing a widget, obviously supply chain and how you source product, that's gonna be important. Your price modeling and an analysis of your direct input costs—that's all gonna be very important for that. If you're a service business, it's gonna be different obviously. But within the last 20 years we've seen contingent liabilities tied to the HR function—just thinking about, you know, the potential liability risk related to Me Too and harassment in the workplace and things like that. And if you're a $2 to $10 million business, you can be—we used to use this term in the banking business—you're as strong as your weakest link. And if you're not using handbooks, if you don't have an approach to employee engagement or, you know, doing job satisfaction analysis, oftentimes you're either gonna get yourself in trouble, you're gonna have higher turnover, which means you've gotta go to market and then hire new people and then train them, which is obviously very costly. But, you know, the key thing here is to avoid that kind of turnover. And so when we look at this through an evaluator's lens, obviously we want to see from an operational standpoint that people have taken these areas seriously and that there are in fact processes in place to address and monitor these.

Then the last two, again, as I said, are a little bit fuzzier. A lot of people that do valuation work say, well, there's no way I can quantify that. But, you know, I think it is observable if you're going and doing a deep dive, and this is just really kind of rhetorical feedback to all of you. Really try to spend the time—the quality time—to understand the dynamic of your leadership team. And again, it's gonna be important: who are you gonna have on your team? And it includes stuff like DISC and Myers-Briggs and stuff like that. But it goes beyond that. It's like, how do you work together as a team? And if you don't have that cohesion, if you don't have that collaboration, it can very well impact your value. And clearly as it relates to talent—retaining key talent—that's something that a lot of owners don't realize is important until it is literally on top of 'em. And then, you know, how do you communicate your vision down to your employees? For instance, I run a company that has 10 people, and I hope that all of 'em could at least minimally articulate what my vision is and what my value set is. And so I try to do a lot of communication. I try to communicate very well what that is, so that everyone is rowing in the same direction. And that's what this whole area really pertains to—cohesion, communication, collaboration. And we find that this is very, very strong with high performing companies that have high value.

And last but not least is—I know I'm talking to a bunch of aspiring owners here—but I'm really talking about you. And when you get past $10 million—20, 30, 40 million—then you have a board of directors, you have an enhanced hierarchical system that doesn't depend as much on you. But when you're at the two to $10 million level, it depends a lot on you. And I can tell you prima facie evidence here, speaking as a business owner: inherently we're all human and it's easy to internalize stress. And oftentimes you try to internalize it, but you wear it—you wind up wearing it on your sleeve. And so if the owner has anxieties—if the owner has not only anxieties with the business, but from a personal standpoint too—it's often very apparent to not only your employees, but you may not even realize it, but it may be apparent to your clients too. And, uh, so addressing that—whether it's your own personal finances or if it's other personal things—your own personal risk control, so on and so forth. And also stressors in the workplace. And this also speaks to who is on your team. And I've been accused of this, and I've looked myself in the mirror and I've recognized that there are things that I need to let go of that serve as a stressor for me. And I need to let go of it and have somebody else do it or bring in somebody to do it. And that's what this owner psychology/owner readiness piece is. It really speaks to you and your mental wellbeing, I should say.

So the last two slides—and we'll open it up—is just, you know, are you leaving value on the table? And I know a lot of you are just jumping into this for the first time, but this is something that you can kind of look at over time and just say, am I doing goals and visioning? And it may sound kind of cliche—well, yeah, I should vision, I should set goals. But being intentful about it, and even if it means going down to the beach for a few days and staring at the ocean and closing your eyes and say, well, what do I want this business to be? That part's pretty important. And it can lead to some really good idea creation. And if you're looking at staff, looking at your competitive situation, you're addressing your financial statement, the quality of those statements, and then you're addressing risk—whether it's on your side personally, or risk within the business—that, you know, again, unfortunately, a lot of people don't address risk until the risk surfaces. And then you don't have time to deal with it. You're just having to triage whatever you can. And then doing contingency planning. And then the last thing here is tax planning. And, you know, there's a lot of wonderful CPAs out there, and unfortunately a relatively small subset of those will take the time to say, you know, here are the things that you should be expensing. Here is maybe a better structure for you. And here are maybe ways that you can structure things to avail yourself to tax credits and things like that. And having that tax planning is gonna be pretty important, because you may not realize it, but you may very well be leaving some value on the table there.

And then finally really just a call to action. And this is in many cases just a regurgitation of that last slide. But I kind of leave this in a slide deck because it's one through eight—it's kind of easy to look at. And I've had some people actually print this off and put it up on the inside of their door to remind them of things. And again, you don't have to tackle all of these in an instant. But I think over time—we can't sit here and guarantee, well, your enterprise is gonna increase 35% in value if you address all these things. But I can tell you by and large that your value will increase if you execute on these things. Because I can tell you that a lot of people don't. And then the last one—again, just to reemphasize this point—focus on you, the owner, and just make sure that you don't forget. 'Cause it's so easy to get, you know, really ensconced in the business, and I know all of you are very excited to become first-time business owners, but it's easy to get immersed in that and then you wind up not taking care of you on either health front or financial front or so on and so forth. And so, again, a big reason why we do what we do is to try to make sure that people understand that.

So, with that, I think I've come to the end of the formal presentation. There's our contact information up there, with a QR that I think should take you to our website. But, I guess, Athena, ready to take some questions if there are questions.

[00:49:00]
Athena (AcquiMatch): So that was amazing. I was like riveted the whole time, so thank you for that. I want to actually pull out the last point because I have never heard—and I know it from helping businesses and my own business—and the owner psychology and how detrimental that is, and in my consulting days, to a business's success. So I was really happy to hear you actually talk about that as a pillar of value, right? So I'm really curious to hear: how has the owner's anxiety or personal stress or their psychology actually decreased value? How often are you seeing that as the case in these smaller two to ten businesses?

[00:50:00]
Tom (Voice and Associates Wealth Consulting): Well, I'm not sure I see it at all. If I could jump in—what we typically see more often is there's an owner that's being pushed by family—maybe kids, spouse—to, you know, you're already old enough, it's time for you to go, and they really don't want to go. That's probably the most common thing. And sometimes they convince themselves they want to go and then they go through the beginning of the process and they realize they don't really want to go.

Athena (AcquiMatch): Yeah.

Tom (Voice and Associates Wealth Consulting): So I haven't seen anybody have so much anxiety that it reduced the value of their business.

Eric (Voice and Associates Wealth Consulting): Yeah. Well, I think what that really speaks to is like owners that maybe are not engaged as much, you know, because they've been doing it so long and they're tired, and we—I mean we have seen that.

[00:51:00]
Athena (AcquiMatch): So, we actually just had this happen and one of our clients, that owner changed their mind even though they were like 85 years old, right. So like, just gripping onto it. So it seems to be, especially with the generation that's now selling and looking at retirement, that kind of part of their identity is being a business owner. So what's—like, Tom, to your point—are you seeing quite a few owners aren't actually ready, not willing to hand it over and being pushed by someone else? Or what would you say is the skew to absolutely ready—take it away from me—I'm not, I don't want to—my family's forcing me to kind of situation?

Tom (Voice and Associates Wealth Consulting): I'd say, um, there's some people that want to sell and get out. I think it's far more likely that they're feeling pressure to begin the process of selling and getting a valuation, and they don't really want to do it. And they find out through the process how much they like doing what they do, or they can't imagine doing anything else. So that's far more likely to happen. And I guess—I understand our audience here is people that are thinking of buying businesses and not actual business owners. So I would say for anybody who's thinking of buying a business, that's probably the one thing you would wanna focus on is, you know—and probably be upfront—like, do you really want to sell this business? Are you doing this because your wife wants you to, your kids are wanting you to, or do you want to?

[00:52:00]
Athena (AcquiMatch): Yeah. 'Cause it's a lot more—and are you ready? Yeah, exactly. It's very costly and frustrating if you go down the line of due diligence as a buyer. You've done QoE, you've, you know, gotten the SBA lined up and then the owner pulls out. So, for folks—most of the folks listening would be thinking future owner—but also when I'm looking at all these businesses, what I'm looking for in the business. So you're saying owner readiness is number one to dig into from the buy side?

Tom (Voice and Associates Wealth Consulting): Yeah, I would. And we'll see that right away. I mean, and it was kind of just instructive for us. The process is usually, you know, we paper up the engagement, and then people would drag their feet getting us the financials. They wouldn't respond. You know, and it's kind of like they know if they do that, then the process is gonna move forward. And so they kind of sabotage themselves by—even though they've paid for the engagement, they may just say, you know what, I want to slow play this. You know, and oh, I gotta wait till my taxes are done, or this or that. So you get an idea that that's going on right from the get go, and it happens a lot more than you would think, just coming in from the outside.

[00:54:00]
Athena (AcquiMatch): Interesting. I'm not surprised to hear that at all. I'm also curious, when we talk about the financial controls on these smaller businesses, what percentage of the businesses would you say don't have good things in place? And follow up question to that: does not having the financials in a good place or not having those kind of tight controls equal bad business, or is there some nuance in between that?

Tom (Voice and Associates Wealth Consulting): I'm gonna add—you know, I was thinking about this, especially during the five pillars—and it's kind of an esoteric answer, but there's a lot of business owners and I'll just think of animals running with the herd. We're typically valuing going concerns—a business that is profitable—and most people that are looking to buy businesses are looking to buy businesses that are profitable. Now, a lot of those businesses—that owner can't necessarily articulate the five pillars. He can't—you know, he's instinctively doing it. He's running with a herd, he's creating these things and he's doing it by feel. So they may not have great financials, but they're doing okay. Once you get them or force them to get somebody to make them for them so that I can analyze them, you'll see that.

So then it becomes kind of a situation when you have a going concern—pretty much everybody running in that herd—and the herd that's running is the going concerns. The ones that are getting eaten are the liquidation situations. So then it's a question of as to, well, are they better than median? Are they below median? And that becomes kind of the nuance that I have to try to get to. Because I think—if you try to describe how to ride a bike, you could basically put a manual together that would have a hundred pages in it. But a lot of these guys just do it instinctively. And so they've got a business that's profitable. They couldn't necessarily tell you why the bike is balanced, but it's going. And so then it's just up to me to kind of look at the industry from a couple different angles and say, well, you're doing okay. You're doing about the median, or you're knocking it out, you're top quartile—or you're, you know, bottom quartile. So that's kind of, uh, maybe not the answer you were expecting.

[00:56:30]
Athena (AcquiMatch): No, I—that's it. Well, so we come across all sorts when we're looking at businesses as a buyer in terms of where their financials are at. And for a lot of people that are used to coming from, you know, places maybe that had audited financials, that they've got, you know, a PE background or something like that, that scares them—that the small business does not have those, that level of financials. You know, I am a small business owner and I know how much time it takes to—and I know the right way to do it, right—and it's still like a massive lift for us to make sure that we're doing everything that we're supposed to be doing. I don't think a lot of owners think about that when they're running the business. So I guess it's a—you know, it does not mean run if you're looking at a business and it doesn't have super tight financials. And it sounds like maybe the answer is somewhere in the—well, you gotta look at all the other things then to kind of—

Eric (Voice and Associates Wealth Consulting): Yeah. I think so. I mean, I think it's—you know, there are certainly instances where we come across anomalies in the financials, and Tom and I will kind of talk about it and say, well, this doesn't really make sense, and you can build some conjectures as to why it is. But, again, you know, that's just—and a lot of times you can flat out explain things that, you know, after you dig in and do the analysis. Like Tom said, the owner's not doing it. But somebody's coming in forensically like us and trying to ascertain value and we're doing it. But a lot of times you can explain it, and sometimes it has to do with, kind of, personal expenses or things that are being run through the business or whatnot. But, you know, there are times where you run into—again, you're not dealing with a lot of audited—well, you're dealing in a lot of instances where it's just self-prepared stuff and it's being handed to a CPA and the CPA is kind of spitting out a tax return. But, you know, every once in a while you run into something that—these line items just don't—there's something here that doesn't sync up.

[00:59:00]
Athena (AcquiMatch): Mm-hmm.

Tom (Voice and Associates Wealth Consulting): I would say though that I've seen a lot of squirrely internal financials, and people literally don't know how to use QuickBooks or they don't use it correctly. Yeah. But, you know, if you've got tax returns and the tax returns are—now, it's a red flag for me if I see three years worth of tax returns and there's a different preparer each year. 'Cause that could be a problem. But if you've got a tax return that's prepared by a CPA, that's—you know, I mean, that's what a lot of business brokers are gonna go by anyway. They're gonna assume that your internal financials are not to be believed. So I would say that, you know, I would run—now I had a case where there was a guy, he was selling his business and he was doing his own taxes, and this was something that was going through an SBA situation and there was a lot of hair on that, and I noted that in my report. There was a lot of things that didn't make sense. So, but for the most part, if you've got—if you've got tax returns, I like to look at both. I do like to see if the tax returns are kind of, sort of very close to the internal financials, 'cause a lot of times the internal financials will give you nuance that the tax returns just don't have the detail. But if there's a lot of space between 'em, you know, I'll just rely on the tax returns. But I would say that at least you want that level of competency with tax returns to be comfortable with the numbers on the business.

[01:01:00]
Athena (AcquiMatch): That's interesting what you said about three different preparers. Why is that a potential red flag or something to dig into?

Tom (Voice and Associates Wealth Consulting): That just goes back to my public company days. You know, if you're getting fired by your accountant or he's like, you know, I really don't like what I'm doing here—maybe you don't like the number, the client didn't like the number, and he goes to somebody else and then somebody else. And, you know, maybe you don't see—you know, maybe tax services instead of CPA. You know, it's a red flag anytime you switch around a lot.

Athena (AcquiMatch): Interesting. I've not heard that before, but I can totally understand that. So it's an interesting one to check out when you get the tax returns—like who's preparing 'em? Is it the same person? Are they a CPA, which—they have different regulations as a tax preparer than somebody that's just preparing taxes, right?

Tom (Voice and Associates Wealth Consulting): Yeah. There's a remarkable lack of professional integrity required to be a tax preparer. You know, that's crazy. I don't know why people would—You know, I mean, I used to have my chainsaw repaired by a guy who lived in a mobile home and it was kind of a scary place to go because you're going there to get your lawnmower or your chainsaw repaired. But there's a CPA business being run out of the mobile home next door. And I don't know anybody who would feel comfortable taking their business and their personal stuff to somebody in that setting. Not saying that there's anything wrong with that, but you gotta just kind of make a value judgment as to—

[01:02:00]
Athena (AcquiMatch): Yeah. Who's advising you? Who's advising them? I'm curious, Eric, with your Blockbuster example. We're in a time now that the hot topic all the time is artificial intelligence. What's the risk to that? So how much is that factoring into your valuations now? I'm sure it comes up a lot, right? Like, what's the potential disruption by this technology? Is it something to even pay attention to? Is it not coming up in valuations? What's the conversation around AI with y'all right now?

[01:03:00]
Eric (Voice and Associates Wealth Consulting): I think you just threw the grenade in the room. Yeah, because, I mean, it's evolving at such a rapid clip. I mean, it might be an enhancement to value. If there's expectation that you could enhance your productivity and reduce your staffing cost to some extent, or maybe your contracted staffing costs—I mean, it could be very helpful. But, you know, you just can't say, oh, well, you utilize AI and that automatically justifies a 10% premium. I mean, you gotta understand what it's being used for. And a lot of people say, I use AI. Well, what does that mean? Well, when I'm writing letters to my clients, I use Grammarly, you know, to help craft the letter. Well, that's not—that's not AI. And I'd say just from a kind of a macro analysis standpoint, there's a lot of kind of like visioning and innovation now, but I think as it relates to $2 to $10 million companies, we're still in the first inning of it being actually incorporated into core business practices, I think. And so I think your question has a lot of validity today, but I think it's going to become intrinsically much more important and impactful, you know, as we look at companies three and four, five years down the road.

Athena (AcquiMatch): Well, especially companies that might be disrupted by it too. Sorry Tom, go ahead. But like, are they using it and are they gonna be made redundant by it?

Eric (Voice and Associates Wealth Consulting): And some are. Yeah. Some are early adopters that have jumped into it two feet. Tom, go ahead.

[01:04:45]
Tom (Voice and Associates Wealth Consulting): I have two examples. One yay, one eh—both kind of—so school photography business that's in trouble from AI, because of a lot of different reasons, the image generation. And so that business model is getting pressure by AI. Another valuation that I'm doing right now is a small advertising agency. And this was fascinating because this guy has a lot of clients that emphasize the family nature of their businesses—they're creating commercials. And when I say commercials—I'm an old guy—these are spots that would appear on anything from TikTok to Insta and what have you. And he was like, you know, the business wants to have children to appeal to the family motif of their business. So we use AI to generate the kids because it's really problematic to have pictures of real kids online. Like, you know, parents don't even want to sign off on it. So right—in kind of the same thing—I mean, you know, school photography on the one hand and advertising on the other, they're using images, yet there's two different outcomes on value. One's using it to increase, and the other—it's a threat to.

[01:06:00]
Athena (AcquiMatch): Interesting. We’re all—like, when we have our client meetings and internal meetings, we're talking about it a lot. We're using it ourselves, we're building it into our business to enhance the human service that we give and remove some of the things that humans don't necessarily need to do. Okay, so here's a fun topic, because this comes up all the time. We see businesses and they're like, the business is valued at this much plus $10 million of inventory. So, when you were talking about the asset/cost approach, where, you know, a going concern, working capital, inventory—like it's, I know it's a very layered conversation, but from a buyer's perspective, when they see a broker saying, oh, it's valued at this much plus this much in inventory—what's someone to make of that from a valuation perspective? What should we bear in mind as buyers when we're looking at a business's value and the inventory/working capital conversation?

[01:07:00]
Tom (Voice and Associates Wealth Consulting): You know, there's a couple different ways to normalize working capital. I use the Bardahl method, which is a fancy way of saying you kind of move it in and look at it over time. But the asset side of the approach is not really that relevant to most businesses, particularly service businesses. I've never really—I mean, you know, if you get into like maybe a restaurant situation, but even then, you know, the stuff's pretty cheap—you know, you're arguing about plates and tables and stuff.

I haven't run into too many businesses where there's a lot of inventory that even a business broker would have to break that out as a separate item—like, well, here's X and then you gotta pay this pre—that doesn't make any sense. I don't know who would say that.

[01:08:00]
Athena (AcquiMatch): We see it all the time.

Eric (Voice and Associates Wealth Consulting): Well, I mean, it could be—from the service business—it could be just like backlog. You know, they're saying, well, here's a pipeline of new activity. And I've seen that personally with some clients that had been—you know, they were trying to make an offer and the seller was trying to argue that they needed to pay a premium for that backlog or whatever, and that could vaporize tomorrow. And obviously that has some cyclical exposure and we all know that things could change rather quickly and that backlog could evaporate. But yeah, I agree with Tom. The whole notion of inventory and equipment appraisal is pretty nuanced. And I'd say that's probably more relevant when you're operating under a liquidation premise of value, where you're just valuing assets necessarily, or you have like a turnaround situation, which again, we don't do too many turnaround situations, but where you've got some kind of existential threat out there and you're like, okay, what could you sell these large assets for? But again, I'd say more often than not, we're doing service businesses and, you know, that's goodwill basically. That's your intangible asset.

[01:09:30]
Tom (Voice and Associates Wealth Consulting): I've done a lot of—I'm thinking of like agricultural businesses, construction with a lot of equipment. But even then the value of the business—and the FF&E goes with the business. So, you know, all those bulldozers and what have you—if they're generating income and if you've got a going concern business, the machinery is gonna be earning more than it's worth. That's why you have it. So, if it's not earning more than it's worth, then the business is probably in trouble. So I really don't see it, even in cases where you've got construction where you've got really a lot of equipment, because it's—

[01:10:00]
Athena (AcquiMatch): So I'd love to try to break this down 'cause a lot of these folks—well, all of 'em are first-time buyers, right? The broker's putting out what they think the value is and they're getting very, like, whoa—they're saying the business is worth this much, but then there's all this inventory on top of it that they're saying needs to be paid for separately. So let me give you a couple examples. One that I looked at myself where they weren't saying the inventory was separate, but they were saying that—oh, it was an event rental equipment business—and they had $17 million worth of inventory. And I went down and looked at the business and it was like a $17 million garage sale. I'm like, there's no way they're using all of this, right? So they're saying that that's the value of it, but they were including that as part of the purchase price.

In other instances that we've seen recently—like something where it's a car membership rental situation where the revenue is generated by people using the vehicles, but they're saying the business is worth this much and also all of these vehicles are gonna be a separate value. Or in another instance where it's a company where they are a distributor of products, right? So they've got all this inventory, which is gonna be valued separate from the business that they actually sell to customers. So hopefully that gives you some ideas of what we're seeing. But I guess for people looking at these businesses—what do you mean by going concern and that the value includes the inventory, just for them to try to wrap their heads around how you are looking at value with inventory and whether it should be part of the value or separate. Does that help explain that? Yeah, it does. We see it a lot; you know, brokers—there's no standardization with brokers and what they chose, asking price, all that.

[01:12:30]
Tom (Voice and Associates Wealth Consulting): Yeah. Well, let's look at the event rental business, which is the first one you mentioned. To me that's a question in nomenclature. So they call it inventory, which is technically working capital, but if your business is renting tables and chairs and things like that, you can't call that inventory. That's the FF&E—I mean, that is what you're buying. So that's what generates—that is your long-term fixed plant and equipment that you are using to generate income from. So for somebody to call that inventory, that's really kind of—not kind of—it's just wrong.

A distributor business—again, you've gotta kind of look at like, okay, is the guy selling the business because he's not doing that well and he's not doing that well because he's got a lot of non-performing inventory that he just wants to unload as part of the deal? You know, that's where you've gotta kind of look at, well, here's some guidelines on what this industry typically has, what kind of inventory turn ratios there are. And, you know, if you're buying a warehouse with a lot of cobweb stuff in it, you know, that's not something you should pay for either. So, you know, you gotta kind of kick the tires a little bit—physically look at it—that's not something that we’ll typically do in a business valuation, but I would highlight it in a report and say, look, you know, this business is carrying twice as much inventory as a typical business in this space, and as a result, its turns are—maybe they're not even half as fast, maybe they're a third as fast. So he's got more inventory, and yet it's turning even slower than it would. Well—and you start to wonder about the health of the business.

[01:15:00]
Eric (Voice and Associates Wealth Consulting): Yeah. And actually that could have—looking at it through a different lens—it could have an adverse impact because, you know, in that case you probably are looking at negative working capital, right? And so that's gonna take away value at the very moment that you've got the seller that's trying to insist that you should be adding value. And, you know, that's just—you're buying an existing business and some of 'em are gonna be run real well, and some of 'em are not. You know, and he may argue, well, I had a great deal and I could buy this surplus inventory. But like Tom said, if it's growing cobwebs and all it is is a drag on your working capital, honestly that probably merits more of a discount than a premium.

[01:15:40]
Athena (AcquiMatch): Okay. I can never bring up enough conversations about working capital. So can you explain your point really quick on negative working capital and what that might look like or what it means for a buyer—someone looking at the business?

[01:16:00]
Eric (Voice and Associates Wealth Consulting): Well, I mean, you know, Tom said that we look at a lot of data. There's a lot of comparable sets that, you know, we can ascertain—like what for your industry group, what's an average receivable collection period and inventory turns and working capital metrics. And then you can kind of derive from that what level of inventory would be steady state to run the business the way you know that it's being run. And then you can kind of, from that, determine what kind of excess working capital—what is non-performing working capital. And by the same token, you look at your collections, your aging schedule and things like that. And you can see—are you extending such generous terms to your clients that you're not able to turn your sales, right? And so, you know, it's just—honestly, it is like financial management 101. Obviously the long-term assets, including goodwill—a well-performing business is gonna have a bunch of goodwill—but that's kind of a little bit more esoteric. But in a transaction goodwill has very important value. But the working capital, I think—maybe Tom jump in here—has the chance of really adding or subtracting to value, depending on how it's managed. A lot of people just say, well, I've got plenty of cash in the bank. Right. Well, that's a very single-plane way of looking at it. 'Cause working capital—maybe what I was talking about earlier about kind of like that apple in the basket that's rotting over time—you don't really notice it. I'm talking about working capital in many respects, because, you know, if you're—these types of things kind of rot at the margin if you're not paying attention to it, and then you realize—you wake up one day and you realize it's a huge problem. And then you've gotta go get an emergency line of credit or something to fix that. And that's why monitoring that and understanding also what are the ratios for your industry, what makes sense. And a lot of people aren't doing that kind of analysis to understand. They're just kind of—as Tom said—they're just feeling it. They're just going, Hey, everything's great. So why do I need to care? You know, I want to work four days a week and I want to go to the ranch on the weekends or something.

[01:18:00]
Tom (Voice and Associates Wealth Consulting): What I'd add to that is—let's look at the definition of working capital. It's current assets minus current liabilities. If you have negative, that means your current liabilities are more than your current assets. And usually that's bad. Now, you know, Michael Dell and Dell Computer at the turn of the century—they used to brag about having negative working capital 'cause they were all about just-in-time. And so if you can get by with a very low amount of working capital, then you don't have that cash tied up in working capital. So, you know, what I see most often—I mean, obviously you want a one-to-one, which is equal. A lot of businesses will carry two-to-one. You know, for me, with a lot of small businesses—especially with the way that nowadays they can have a bank relationship where if they're the sole owner, they're parking their cash in the bank and they're earning a pretty good return on CDs or money market or what have you. And so, technically their working capital might be 10-to-1. Well, obviously that's over—and the owner's gonna take most of that out. But, I don't—you know, a working capital ratio that's low is not necessarily a negative if they're managing it well. And that was the thing that Dell used to do—they would brag about how they were, you know, even dragging out through the time that they were building computers—this is when they were still making 'em in the United States. But they were all about, like, hey, you know, we don't want our money tied up in working capital. And the CFO would come on every quarter and talk about how they managed to wring another couple hundred million dollars out of working capital. So inherently it's not a bad thing, but you have to look at the way the business is being run, and if they're paying all their bills, it's not a problem.

[01:20:30]
Eric (Voice and Associates Wealth Consulting): Yeah. And this is a good time to kind of introduce this whole concept that, again, we don't see a lot of these—although you can run this report in QuickBooks—but cash flow statements. Because you can make adjustments and you can do—you could be creative on the income statement and in many cases on the balance sheet too. But you can't, you know, fool cash, right? I mean, cash is cash. So if you're—just intuitively—we're talking about working capital. I mean, that's cash flow from operations, right? So you're gonna have—if you're increasing your inventory, that's a use of cash. But if you're extending out your liabilities, that's a source of cash. And so I think, to emphasize and amplify Tom's point, if you're able to manage free cash flow and think about it that way, as opposed to just net income, which most people do—if you look at it from a cash flow perspective, then that's the true measure of how well you're functioning as an operator.

[01:22:00]
Athena (AcquiMatch): Yeah. Good stuff. I'm obsessed with cash flow. That's the statement I spend the most time in as a business owner is cash flow forecast. Right—you run outta cash, you can't run your business. So, a two-part question. I hope the first part's easy. Could you just give a 10th grader definition of goodwill, and then could you talk about the difference between a business valuation and quality of earnings and where the line might be between the two or why you might want one or the other or both as a business buyer?

[01:22:45]
Tom (Voice and Associates Wealth Consulting): Well, the goodwill question's pretty easy. And SBA documentation requires it. So, you know, we'll do the valuation from a market approach, income approach, asset approach. Let's say I come up with the value of the business being $2 million. And then you look at the balance sheet and the hard assets that are tangible on the balance sheet are $800,000. So goodwill's $1.2 million. So it's just the difference between the value of the business and the tangible assets.

So the second question was a little more esoteric—could you repeat?

[01:23:30]
Athena (AcquiMatch): Quality of earnings. Like if you were to just simply define the difference between valuation and quality of earnings, and then maybe why you might want one, the other, or both.

Tom (Voice and Associates Wealth Consulting): Well, quality of earnings—that's a more detailed report than valuation because you're starting to get forensic and you're looking to see if there's any chicanery going on. Are you declaring that you're earning more than you actually are? And, you know, that's much more detailed. I have to confess, we would love to do a quality of earnings engagement. We never have, but that would be one of the pricier things that we would do, because it would be not only a valuation, but then you're really kind of coming at it from a forensic standpoint.

And I'll just roll back on the structure of a business valuation: it is essentially a report that details what a hypothetical buyer would pay to a hypothetical seller. And that's it. That meets the industry standard. In a quality of earnings, you're coming up with a value, but then—and just back to the—so we will say we've accepted these financial statements from these sources, and this is what we are using, and we're not an auditor and we're not expressing any opinion on those financial statements. Quality of earnings—you are expressing an opinion, and you're expressing a very pointed opinion. And so it's a much deeper dive than even a conclusion of value business valuation.

[01:25:30]
Athena (AcquiMatch): Good. Yeah, I wanted to make sure. So we always recommend clients to definitely get a QoE as part of their due diligence process because it is different from the valuation, which in their instance it will usually come up because the SBA needs it in order to do an SBA loan—they're required to get a business valuation is where, you know, a lot of your experience is, if you're not just working directly with maybe the broker or the seller themselves. So, I know we're at time. This has been so fascinating and so fun. You can tell the kind of nerd I am that I'm like, I love this stuff so much. So thank you so much. This was a ton of value, a ton of really great insight.

So we are gonna have you back to talk about the next piece of this—as a business owner, how are you doing that planning and wealth management side of things? How are you thinking about things like the 401(k)s and those sorts of things that make up managing the wealth that you are, but also risk planning, I think, too, it sounds like, around that. So give us a little preview of what we might expect to—I'm butchering the description, but—

[01:26:45]
Eric (Voice and Associates Wealth Consulting): No, I think that's good. Well, I mean, I think we've touched on a lot of the points. You know, I think you learn from experience and you realize, after the fact, you know, people sell and they—oh gosh, you know, I would've, coulda, shoulda. And I think that that's really the bottom line. And a lot of it is just contingency planning. And the HR—the human capital function—is so important. And, you know, I mean, you have to be competitive. I mean, I sit on our local city council and, I mean, we're talking about having to do salary benchmarking in half the time that we were used to doing it, just because the market is moving fairly rapidly. And the labor markets are still pretty tight despite what you may see on CNBC. But yeah, I mean, I think it's just going through the various aspects of the owner. Making sure—if you have multiple owners—that you're protected if something happens. You know, as I kind of put my—I’m not a lawyer and I don't play one on TV—but I do oftentimes think like one. It's like, well, what are the circumstances that could arise in that range of outcomes, and you've got that fat-tail occurrence—it's a low probability of happening, but if it happens, it's gonna be extremely costly. And how do you guard against that? And, you know, sometimes you just need to have an advocate or somebody that's riding side saddle to you as you're jumping in and you're thinking about, I need to sell this widget. Alright, well I need to manufacture this widget here and I need to ship it here, and I need to make sure that I account for it, and then I've gotta pay my people. Well, you know, that's very encompassing. And so oftentimes they're just not stepping back and thinking about, okay, well what if I hit, you know, hit the bus—or somebody else hits the bus. Right. You gotta protect your people. You gotta protect yourself. And I'd say that's just—in a nutshell—what we're gonna try to accomplish.

[01:29:00]
Tom (Voice and Associates Wealth Consulting): I had one point I forgot to make, if I might. Is your audience mostly Austin-centric?

Athena (AcquiMatch): No, we're all over the US.

Tom (Voice and Associates Wealth Consulting): Oh, okay. All right. Because Austin is hot and it's been hot for 40 years, and I talk to a lot of people that wanna buy in Austin and they want to pay like, you know, maybe a multiple that might be effective in Cleveland. And I'm like, no. There are regional premiums. Yes. And so to the extent that you're in a place like Austin that has grown—you know, Austin over 40 years has grown at essentially twice the rate of the rest of the country in terms of its economy. So you’re gonna have to pay a premium to get into a market like that.

[01:29:45]
Athena (AcquiMatch): No, you're so right. And actually we have a limit on certain markets in terms of how many clients we'll take on 'cause they are such hot search markets. So Austin being one of those where I'm just like, it's a 12-month waitlist at minimum right now. So, yeah—I think there's probably a part two for us on this side of things too—like when we can get under the hood a little bit on nuances of value, if you guys are up for it. I've really enjoyed this and it's such good information for us to think about and for all of our clients here as we're looking at businesses. So, Eric, I'd love to—and Tom—like we can brainstorm maybe some part twos to value: these things, these nuances, regional hotspots, industry trends, what the business buying craze on the internet is doing to valuations, all of those sorts of things. If you're up for it, maybe we can do yet another conversation after the wealth management.

Eric (Voice and Associates Wealth Consulting): Absolutely. Well, sure. I think you could spend a lot of time just on the—if you could get owners, like once all these folks are in the saddles and running their businesses—going through the strategic planning process and understanding how do you utilize valuations to accomplish or to measure that progress, to say, you know, here's year one, here's year three, here's our— I mean, you could actually quantify the success of the implementation of those plans. So—

[01:31:00]
Athena (AcquiMatch): Love it. Lots of good stuff for us to dig into. We'll share your details, slides, and the recording with everybody that wasn't able to make it live today. And then put a note in your calendar, everybody, for September 4th so we can do that wealth management contingency planning conversation as well.
