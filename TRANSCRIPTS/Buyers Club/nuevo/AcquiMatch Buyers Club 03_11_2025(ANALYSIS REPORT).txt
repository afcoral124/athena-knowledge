Location: ~00:20:15 / Speaker: Athena
Transcript excerpt: "...since Steph put it on, it's the expert to like, have these conversations at the bank..."
Issue: Phrase contains a non-participant name ("Steph") and reads incoherently.

Impact: Medium

---

Notes on patterns and system improvement
- Recurrent ASR confusion with acronyms/terms: GAAP->gap; SDE->STE; mezz->Mazda; pari passu->parapursuit; lender->letter; lenders->vendors. These are high-value terms in M&A contexts; tuning the ASR language model with a domain glossary would reduce such errors.
- Speaker attribution hiccups occur around short acknowledgments and turn transitions (e.g., “I can,” “Hey, Steve”), increasing confusion. A diarization pass or constrained speaker model could help.
- Technical audio dropouts were transcribed verbatim; consider automatic detection/removal of connectivity chatter to streamline transcripts.

Segment summary (coarse)
- 00:00–00:01: Admin greetings/logistics (MIXED; remove small-talk lines per REMOVAL #1)
- 00:01–00:13: Polly/broker offer loop strategy (KEEP; remove driving/connectivity as per #2–5, #6)
- 00:13–00:33: Jason/Tariq financing and lender engagement strategy (KEEP)
- 00:27–00:31: Office suite LOI timing/CPA tax implications (KEEP; fix errors #9–#10)
- 00:34–00:37: Negotiation framing (KEEP)
- 00:37–01:01: Andrew off-market SaaS/CRM deal financing strategy (KEEP; remove coffee shop/poutine/closing logistics per #7–#10; fix errors #7–#8, #11–#12, #17–#18)
- 01:02–01:03: Program scheduling/admin (REMOVE per #11)

This set preserves all substantive deal, financing, and strategy content while removing personal/off-topic chatter and surfacing high-impact transcription issues.
