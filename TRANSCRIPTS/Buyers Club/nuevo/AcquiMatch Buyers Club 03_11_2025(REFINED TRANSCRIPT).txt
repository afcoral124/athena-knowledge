Title: AcquiMatch Buyers Club

[00:00:00]
Athena: So, um, we as a team have kind of caught up on some of your deals. So I was going to pick on a few of you if you are around. It sounds like there's some little challenges and stuff that we might be able to troubleshoot and that are also useful for other people to hear. So, um, let's see. There's Steve. Cool. I was going to actually ask you and Polly about what's going on because it sounds like you're in a little loop with asking for information and them asking you for information. So I don't know if the two of you would like to talk through what's going on there. Let's see, Steve. I think you might be on mute. And Polly, there you are also in the car.

Polly: Can you hear me? Yeah,

Athena: I can hear you. I can hear both of you now.

Athena: Yeah. Yeah. It sounds like you got, you got a loop happening with your, your deal that you're interested in. Do you want to talk about that?

Polly: Well, I was out of town last week and so I was, I was helping my mom and I just, um, I’ve been getting a lot of emails and calls from the broker asking for what we would offer for the business. And I'd never had a broker ask me that. Now, I haven't, you know, we've spoken with a good amount of brokers now for various businesses, and I never had a broker actually reach out and ask me for that information. Doesn't sound like it's too uncommon. Just it was uncommon for me, though. I, um, you know, I told her that because we didn't have the financials from August through December of last year, we really would feel more comfortable, you know, if we were going to present any type of, like, approximate offer to be able to look at those. And she said, well, they don't have them ready or prepared yet. And I was thinking, okay. So anyway, I said, I'm going to be going out of town. I explained that I was going to really kind of be out of touch last week. And she reached out to me, um, just prior to my leaving. And then she reached out again to me last Friday. And she said, I really would like to know, you know, she's, she's basically just been kind of on a repeat of what she's asked for. And Ryan was super helpful. He said, why don't you, why don't you word it this way, so to speak. And I did, um, just go back to her and I said, listen, I'm really looking forward to coming down to meet the seller, um, Jeanette. I said, I'm really looking forward to meeting her, which I'll be doing that next Tuesday. I said, if everything checks out with the financials that we're still waiting for, and, you know, if the business, you know, after meeting her looks like something that we want to move forward with, then we would just offer the asking price. And you know what? I haven't heard from her since, so that—I don't know if that's good news or bad news. But the way I look at it is she's not asking me anymore. So maybe that needed to happen.

Athena: Yeah, it's interesting with those sorts of things. So sometimes I like—like, just to clear up the context with everybody that's listening. You all are waiting—you've only got partial year for 2024. So you're waiting for the full-year financials, but you're trying to schedule an in person with the owner and the broker's kind of stonewalling: what's your offer, what's your offer? And you're like, well, we don't have the full financial picture. So sometimes we get in these kinds of loops, um, where it's like, well, we don't have the full information, so we can't really give you what you want. And she's like, well, I don't have, you know, verification that you are not wasting their time. So what I like to do in those situations is have a conversation rather than—because, like, they might be asking for something that they think will give them what they want. But it's like, what is the actual concern? Are you concerned that we are not able to financially close this deal? If so, like, then we can provide you with, you know, our prequalification, our personal financial statement. So, like, before even responding with the offer, I might give her a call and be like—

[00:05:25]
Athena: Yeah. So, um, in any situation where we're in a loop with someone—it's like, well, I need this and they're like, well, I need this—then what I like to do is actually get them on the phone and be like, Hey, so I totally understand you're asking for an asking price and, you know, I'm sure you can understand I don't have visibility of the numbers. So I'd feel bad giving you an offer that might change once I get access to the numbers. So, you know, what's your concern at this point with, you know, introducing me to this seller? And just have a conversation, right? There are so many people that have no idea what they're doing that are getting in touch with brokers right now. And the brokers don't know how to handle it. So you might be able to solve the problem in a different way. If she's concerned about your ability to close or your ability to finance this deal, you know, then you can kind of uncover that. If she's like, I just need your number, then it'd be like, well, I get that and I understand why you'd like that at this point, but I wouldn't want you to get a number now from me that changes when I get access to their financials. Um, are you concerned with my ability to be able to finance the deal? Like, is there something else I can do to give you confidence? And kind of put it back on them to solve the problem, right? Because it's like, I don't have the information that I need. I wouldn't want to put you in a position where you're going to look bad with your seller if I change the number after I get access to those financials, but we don't want to hold up this process. So what's your advice at this point? Or what would you like to see? Or what would give you confidence in moving this forward at this point? I can give you my prequalification for the bank. I can give you access to bank screenshots or a personal financial statement or, like, what do you need to feel confident? You know, what do you need to see—and have them solve the problem for you. Because it feels like maybe she's just concerned you're a tire kicker and not serious as opposed to—or that you're not able to close or something like that. So it's like, what would you like to see at this point? What would give you confidence? Because I'm a person of integrity. So if I give you an offer, I want to stick to that. I can give you an offer now, but once you give me the financials, you know, that might change. So is that what you want? Or is there something else I can give you to make you feel confident in, you know, me meeting the seller and getting access to those financials? That's what I would do, because sometimes people ask for things that they think will solve the problem, but it's not the actual problem. You know, it's like, what is the problem? Yeah, I'm concerned that we don't have the, you know, the financial capability to do this. That we're not serious. Like, what is the actual problem? Get to the root of that. And then present solutions and/or ask them for alternative solutions. Like, well, you know that the '24 financials are going to be essential for us to be able to move forward regardless. I'm a person of integrity. I don't want to give you a price that I'm going to change down the line. What would you do in my situation? Like, what would you like to see from me instead?

Polly: Okay, I'll definitely give her a call after we get off our call. Maybe even a few minutes before that. Because I do think a conversation needs to be had. I mean, we had a conversation. So, um, the last change was email. So.

[00:09:15]
Athena: Phone conversation might be good and I would, I would just—hopefully Steve can relay this to you if it's cutting in and out—but I would express your seriousness and your excitement about this business and just be like, well, you know, what can I do to alleviate your concerns at this point, in absence of me having access to the '24 numbers? And then what can I do to give you confidence, you know, and then see where you go from there. Because understandably these brokers are getting hit up by a whole bunch of people that don't have money, that aren't serious, that don't know what they're doing. They don't have people like us helping them through the process. So, um, you know, see if that can help you get somewhere and then, while you're waiting for those '24 numbers—or, like you said, you sent over the “well, if everything checks out, then I can meet your asking”—but I don't know if that will actually satisfy her because you're just like, okay, well, if you say it is what it is... like, is that really going to give her more confidence?

Polly: Right. Well, I'll give her—um, can you hear me now? Okay. Yeah, I—

Athena: I can.

Polly: I will definitely give her a call today before the end of the day and follow up with her to make sure that, uh, that, you know, she got the answers from me that she needed, and go from there. But I, um, I think that's all really good information. Good advice. So I appreciate that. And I will, I'll definitely give her a call and do a little more digging and try to answer questions—other questions she might have.

Athena: Yeah. And I think it's a good lesson and something to bear in mind with everybody is, like, when you get stuck in a loop and it's like you're asking for the same thing and they're asking for the same thing—that's a moment to pause, get on the phone, and say, like, hey, so we're in a little loop here. And you can even make a joke about it. Like, I know what you want and you know what I want and we're not getting there. So let's find a different way, you know. And, like, people love—okay, I don't know about you, but I like it when somebody is nice, makes a little joke and is like, I'm committed to finding a solution here that makes you feel good, makes me feel good. So what can we do? You know, it's like, what a nice different energy that is for brokers who are just getting people all the time like, I did the numbers and why is there this dip in SDE in this year and blah, blah, blah, you know. So it's like they get assaulted from like a bunch of angry, not-nice people that think that brokers are bad, and so you can even get on the phone with her and be like, Hey, I know your job is so hard and you got so many people hitting you up. And how do you discern who's serious? Like, I get all that. We're both asking for the same things. And I want you to know I'm committed, but, like, let's find a solution here in the meantime. Um, and then it's like, oh, how nice—this person is being nice to me and wants to solve a problem and is telling me how hard I—they see that I work and they know how hard my job is, you know. It's like, yeah, I help people like that. You want to work with people like that. And that's going to give you some confidence too. So, um, it's a good—it happens a lot. We stall out and then people, you know, it's just like, we just keep asking each other for the same thing in different words. And it's like, we're not actually getting to the root of what's the problem. Are you not confident in us as buyers? What else can I show you?

Polly: Yeah. Yeah, definitely.

Athena: Yay. Cool. Report back. Let us know how it goes.

Polly: I will. Definitely.

Athena: Great. Okay, cool. Nice work, Polly. Um, Jason, are you there? I was curious. I know you're having a little, little challenges with the seller. I don't see your camera on this, so I don't know. There you are.

Jason: Always have challenges.

Athena: Yes, you're getting, you're getting some handwritten stuff. How's it going with Tariq?

Jason: It's always handwritten. Um, you know, I had another conversation with him this morning. And yeah, he always comes back with the response, Jason, I'm a CPA, maybe you just don't understand this stuff. This is a response to me every time,

Athena: right?

Jason: Uh, and he basically says everything is there. I was like, but Tariq, I sent you an email asking you to summarize the revenue, the net income and the add-backs. And you said you would, but now, like, there's this resistance. I mean, I didn't—obviously, I didn't say that to him—but I, you know, I said, like, hey, I sent you an email saying, like, hey, the lender wants these three things. Are you going to provide them? This was Friday. He said yes. Checked up on him Tuesday morning. And he essentially hasn't done any of that. So, then he comes back with his normal response, you know, like, have them come here and, you know, see what we're doing here. And like, you know, I just think he thinks this is going to convince them that they should just give him some money without having the numbers. And I wanted—I just want to tell him, like, that's not going to help. They need to see the numbers. These are bankers. All right. And then when I talk to him about this, he's like, Jason, you're just not a CPA. You don't understand. Uh, so, uh, you know, this is where I got to the point where I said, how about, you know, I get the lender to ask his questions directly to you. And he's like, that's totally fine. He's like, you can give them my number. He's like, they can call me the questions they want to ask me. I'm willing to answer them. So that's kind of where I left it off. I reached out to the lender this morning. Haven't heard back. I just followed up again saying, like, hey, do I need to coordinate a call? Uh, there's also another lender, uh, that we already have a call set up with Tariq. Uh, so Thursday afternoon, I'm actually going to go over there and then set up a Zoom call that I've already got set up and, you know, we're just gonna—I guess I'll just be the mediator between him and the lender.

Athena: Yeah, don't remove yourself from that conversation. Like, anytime the lender is on, you need to be in on that conversation. Don't let them talk directly. Otherwise you won't have the context or be able to refer back to things that they asked for. Um, so that's good—you’re going to do the Zoom. But what lenders are you having him talk to?

Jason: Uh, the Pathway and the other one—I always forget this guy's name. I'm trying to look it up real quick.

Athena: I was thinking Toomey.

Jason: Yeah, it's Toomey.

Athena: Okay. Yeah, I don't—

Jason: I don't know who he's with though. I always forget the name of his bank.

Athena: Um, yeah, I just know Toomey, because he's actually moved banks. So he's the one that springs to mind. But, um, okay. Yeah. So we know that Tariq uses the "I'm a CPA" as his defense response. So, every time you hear that, what you should translate it in your head is: I'm scared, I don't know what's going on, and I don't like looking like I don't know what's going on. That's what that is. Like, he's a little bit out of his depth right now because he views himself as this very astute CPA, and you are asking things that he doesn't know or doesn't know how to respond to, which is questioning his whole identity.

Jason: Yeah, you know, I think—when we last left off in, like, in February, where we basically, like, said, we don't have a deal, uh, you know, I kind of just told him, like, unless you fix your financial practices and start that following, like, GAAP accounting, like, you're going to come across the same problem over and over again. And then when I followed up with him. Um, you know, Ryan has a great suggestion—sending the thank you letter, which I think he appreciated. And I followed up with him on a phone call. Um, I think he realized from that conversation that he has to get better accounting practices. I don't know if he understands how to get there. You know, I still think he is kind of set in his ways and still using this 20-year-old operating system and software and, you know, uh, but I think he does understand that, you know, if he wants to ever get to the next step of trying to get his company sold that he has to do these things.

Athena: Yeah, but I guess to humanize it, right, is imagine you build a software company and you're 30 years down the line, and you got somebody coming in and they're just, like, questioning your whole code, the way you've engineered everything. They're like, this is so out of date—I’m not saying you're saying it like that—but imagine you're sitting in that seat with your whole identity, your life—“I am an engineer, I'm really good at what I do, I'm ready to sell this business that I think is a really great business”—and somebody is coming in and asking me questions that I—like, you know, all these new techs and softwares and ways of coding, and there's probably going to be a million different languages. And it like—it literally rattles your whole identity when someone starts questioning that. So he is facing the fact that he is irrelevant, outdated, and out of his depth when his whole life he views himself as being very astute with financials as a CPA. So I point all that out because when he has that "I'm a CPA" response, picture yourself in a seat 30, 40 years down the line and thinking you've been an amazing engineer your whole life, and somebody's talking to you in a language you don't understand, and it threatens your whole identity. Like, that's a big thing, right? So, we can kind of understand why Tariq is, like, freezing up, and even though, rationally, he's like, I'm a CPA, and it's like, well, it still doesn't change the fact we need the numbers. But, like, that response is him like, shit, I don't know what's going on right now. So I'm going to use that as my defense because that would shatter my whole identity if I admitted that I didn't understand how these finances worked.

Jason: That's a big thing.

Athena: And something I think he has to—I think he's probably challenged with saying it out loud. But I think he already realizes that,

Jason: which is hard.

Athena: That is hard. So what we could do is placate the expert that he is, you know, and be like, gosh, Tariq, I know you are the expert and you are the CPA, but I'm really struggling to translate it to the bank. Do you mind having that—since you're like, you know this way better than I do, and I'm wrapping my head around it—so the bank has all these questions and I'm not able to answer it. Let's—so let's put it on the expert to have these conversations with the bank, and it's like, they're not going to give me the money unless they get their questions answered. And I'm kind of struggling with how to answer it. So, um... you know, and it sounds like you're setting up those calls, but just from the energetic place that you're positioning that at, it's like, you're the expert. We're going to get a lot further when you communicate with them directly.

Jason: Yes, that's kind of my approach where it's like, okay, he's a bit dismissive towards me because he's the CPA. I'm not. So it's like, let me just put you in touch directly with the lender. And you explain to him because I'm sure you see the—

Athena: edge, right? So rather than like, I'll show you when you speak to the lender, right?

Jason: You know, it's not, it's not even that—where I'm kind of playing ignorant. I'm like, I don't know. So, like, let me set you up with the lender so you two can figure it out. You two financial experts can, like, figure out how we can get to this next step, because I basically told him, like, Tariq, like, the finish line—it's like, it's right there. Got these last four months.

Athena: Yeah. So, in which case, then, like, when you ask for those summaries of the things that you need from him, if you don't want it handwritten, I would be going to his office and, like, writing it up with him, right? Um, I feel like that's—it's going to be one of those situations with him where it will probably be more frustrating for you to communicate electronically than it will be to just go there, have him, like, annotate to you, write it up—Is this right?—you know, and then be able to do it that way.

Jason: Yeah, that's what I'm doing Thursday. That's why I'm going there in person and then I'll use this ledger document he has, and, you know, I'll just say, which one of these—like, tell me the line items equal your revenue, which ones equal, like, total income, which ones are add-backs.

Athena: Great. With the add-backs, though, we kind of don't want to show our hand on that too. So, like, you know, we can get his idea of his add-backs, but we don't want to, like, reveal all of the things that could be add-backs also. So that's something to be careful on with the off-market. And I know Ryan helps you guys with that. But, you know, sometimes there'll be add-backs in there that they wouldn't consider add-backs, but it's just like bonus money that we would be able to use as add-backs and that sort of thing. But this sounds like, you know, even though it's frustrating, it's a good exercise because you would have had to, like, get this intimate with him and his books and his financing process anyway, so better to do it early on to see if it's something that you can get a handle on before you buy it so that you can change it after.

Jason: Yeah, he had mentioned, you know, these are slow months. I was like, well, this is the best time to see this information, right? Because if the company can't service the debt, then we have no deal.

Athena: Was he concerned that, like, the revenue is dipped?

Jason: He just said, these are usually slow months because, you know, winter's not big construction windows, which, you know, makes sense to me, right? Start usually starts ramping up around April and May.

Athena: Yeah. Also, manufacturing is going to be a really great thing to be in.

Jason: Uh, I agree. You know, I was talking to Ryan about this. There's opportunities to sell this to, like, large shops, like Lowe's, and like, why is he not manufacturing for these large businesses? Like, the competitors he mentioned—they're doing it, right? He could be the high-quality version.

Athena: Well, just American manufacturing in general is going to have a nice little [run] over the next couple of years too. So, um, you know, it's—but the books thing and, like, wrapping your head around his processes and stuff, like, the more that you can spend in person with him, kind of, like, getting to know that and transferring it—some of it to your own spreadsheets, or maybe even, like, getting a QuickBooks thing and starting to do stuff.

Jason: Oh, yeah, I would probably get Chris to help me out with some of that stuff. But, you know, to me, um, I really just—I got to see if, like, the lenders think we have a deal here or not.

Athena: Yeah. Um, and then depending on what comes through and after you've gotten further down the track and what comes up during the diligence process, then we have an opportunity to look at the price and the risk again. So we wouldn't do it this early on. But, like, I know you and Ryan have talked about that. Um, you know, there's a potential opportunity—because he wasn't willing to do the books and that sort of thing—that you're able to do a retrade or adjust the purchase price or the terms to cover some of the risk of not going through that process. You know, but not early on. So, um, you know, for the benefit of everybody, we don't want to do negotiation fatigue after we're under offer. So if you negotiate something every time it comes up, then the seller just can get fatigued and you can end up losing momentum on the deal. Instead, what we like to see you all do is write down all the things that come up after—that's like, that's an issue, that's an issue, that's an issue, that's an issue—and then when you get the full list and a good understanding of all the things that you're going to need to have another conversation with, then you decide in what order and what hierarchy, what's a deal breaker, what's not, and you can do it all in one go. And then you can use negotiation tactics like we know from Never Split the Difference, where you can feel like you're giving concessions on things that actually weren't that important to you so you can get things that are really important to you, rather than doing it every single time something comes up. So Jason will be faced with that as he uncovers more and more and goes through this, and it can be really hard not to have a conversation with them when it comes up. But the more fuller picture you get of what all of the things are, the better you're going to set yourself up for negotiation.

Jason: Yeah. Uh, so. Can we shift gears to this office suite deal?

Athena: Sure. Yeah, I didn't know that was still in play.

Jason: I don't know if it's in play either. So the broker hit me up yesterday and they're like, they're still talking to their CPA. I was like, what? It's been seven days. They haven't responded to me. They just kind of are like keep nudging me like hey, we're still around but no one's doing anything. So, you know, to me like even if they came back and like, we accept your offer—it's like, well, you missed the deadline, the deadline was last week.

Athena: That's normal though. Like, I don't know if you were on the call with—did you listen to the legal LOI call that we did? That's a good one for you to listen to because they've talked a lot about the other stuff. But yeah, the expiration date on the LOI is always ignored. Always. But we put it on there to try to create some expediency on their side.

Jason: Okay. Yeah. Because I think with the other deal—like maybe it's just because it's off market—he took that date seriously.

Athena: In terms of when your offer expired?

Jason: Yeah.

Athena: Yeah, so we normally put a week knowing full well it’s always ignored. And like, James David, when he was going through the template on the Buyers Club, he was like, it's kind of pointless to even put it on there. But whatever, we put it on there—you guys wanted it. But, like, most of the time they ignore it. So the whole purpose of that is for them not to sit with it forever, and you to have an opportunity to come back to them and be like, hey, it's expired. Now what's going on? Like, is this still in play? But knowing that they will likely not meet the deadline. So we just—what we don't want to do is put it into a situation where we don't put an expiry date and then they think they can go and shop around forever. So it's just showing them that you're serious and trying to give yourself a kind of timeline to check in on. Um, so, so the broker followed up with you, correct?

Jason: Yeah, and he basically said the seller is following up with the CPA again.

Athena: What are they checking with the CPA? Is that like their tax situation?

Jason: Yeah, the tax implications of the deal.

Athena: Right. Um, so what's the broker advising in terms of next steps, or they're just kind of not sure what to do either?

Jason: Yeah, I don't—I feel like he doesn't—he's waiting for the seller to get back to him.

Athena: Would it be worth suggesting a call with the seller/CPA? You know, like, if the seller is still interested—it's expired, I'm kind of losing my confidence here—like, is it worth us having another chat to see where they're at?

Jason: Yeah.

Athena: I mean, if you like it enough to have a conversation at this point, then I would just—

Jason: You know, I'm just trying to keep—like, I talk to Ryan about this over and over again—like, trying to keep the momentum going. Like, just to have something on the burner cooking. It is kind of what—not super excited about this deal. It doesn't, you know, doesn't get me to my perfect day. Uh, so I'm not super excited about it, but it's better than nothing.

Athena: And it gives you something else to focus on so you don't get, like, to Tariq's the only one. So it makes you come more level-headed on the one you do want. So I would get back to touching base with the broker and be like, are they—I mean, if they're still interested in me, let's get on a call and see where they're at so I can gauge their kind of interest, because I'm feeling like they haven't responded—they're not serious, you know. So kind of brokers do to the buyers is like, are they serious? If so, let's have a conversation, you know. Especially with a broker. So we see this a lot where brokers will just kind of—offer's out, like, okay, hands—they'll dip out at the weirdest points or not get involved when they should be getting involved. In which case that gives you license to, like, take the lead. If the broker is not—usually on-market brokers: what's your offer, you know, competition and blah, blah, blah. But if the broker's kind of, it's like, that gives you the opportunity to take the lead and say, like, well, here's what I think we should do next. What do you think?

Jason: Okay.

Athena: So cool. Well, um, so you have the calls. Um, let's see. So you haven't scheduled the 2nd lender call to everyone on Thursday. Are you going to try to do them all at once?

Jason: Uh, that'd be great if I could. I'm waiting to hear back from, uh, the lender, you know, because initially out of frustration, I was just like, you call Tariq. But then I emailed him this afternoon saying, like, hey, how can I kind of coordinate this?

Athena: Yeah, I think you definitely don't want to not be in that conversation. Um, so that, like, if they asked him for something and you didn't hear that, then you don't have the, hey, Tariq, remember they asked you for that—you know, like, you have nothing to—and you're losing that kind of relationship and stuff. So I would definitely not have them go direct to the seller for sure.

Jason: I mean, feel as good as I can. Um, you know, just, uh, at this point dealing with Tariq, my confidence is pretty low, but we'll see what happens.

Athena: Yeah, I mean, gives you a good feeling of what it will be like to work with him, too, right? Because it's like, this is just the start of the relationship, so you're kind of seriously dating at this point. Is this really someone I want to marry? So, you know, it's—but it also gets you further than you've gotten before. So you learn.

Jason: I think once we get the passive finance stuff and he's actually just in the business teaching me how the business works, I think it would be a lot different.

Athena: Yeah, that's good. So—and again, remember that, like, every time he is like, I'm a CPA—rather than you feeling like he's speaking down to you—just think of the young man that was so excited when he got licensed that is now having his entire identity called into question. Like, that's gotta be a really hard thing. And I think it's something harder for, um, like older men in particular about age—in their seventies and eighties—when their entire identity is their work and nothing else. So it's a very hard thing for them to let go of their business and it's even worse for them to feel like they are not useful anymore, or that they're not relevant, or that they're not actually experts. Um, it's the equivalent of death for a lot of them. So, um, I think I told you the story of, like, John, the car wash owner that was just—he was hilarious and he got 6 million dollars for his car wash and, um, a couple of months later, he writes me, he's like, do you know anyone that—like, he's like, I need a job. I need to work. Like, do you know anyone that I can—hire right now? I was like, you got six million dollars for your car wash, you know, and you had no debt on that. It's hilarious. So a lot of them are like that. So I think that's something that can maybe help you get over the frustration a little bit, because it is super frustrating, especially when somebody's like, I'm an expert. I know what I'm doing. And it has nothing to do with you and everything to do with him feeling very self-conscious about where he's at.

Jason: Nope, I get it.

Athena: Nice. Good. Excited. Oh, Steve, you wanted to say something.

Athena: Hey, Steve.

Steve: So just a comment. So I think you're taking the right approach, number one. Uh, so my field is sales—I've been through a lot of negotiating classes and, you know, and I'm in cybersecurity sales. So, you can imagine I'm dealing with the smartest person in the room at all times who does not trust anybody—zero trust everywhere.

Jason: Yeah, tin foil hat.

Steve: Yeah, exactly. And so one of the things just going through a lot of these different trainings—and it kind of does work—and I think you're doing that approach. It's just reminding them: Hey, I want to do a deal, and I understand what you're saying, but the bankers are saying this. I want to do a deal. What do we do? We—and not just me and you—what do we do? And then, oh, the old Columbo: I have an idea. You know, how about this—why don't we approach the bank together so we can leverage your expertise? And then just, you know, then it's his idea. I don't know. It's worked a lot in areas where I'm just trying to throw something against the wall and everything else. But just a reminder that, you know, to him it's like, hey, I want a deal, you want a deal. I got a problem—it's not me, it's those guys—and you're already pointing at him already, I saw when you're talking about it. So I think you're on the right approach and good luck with that. But, uh, I feel for you to deal with somebody who's the smartest person in the room.

Athena: That's a really good point, Steve. Something else, Jason, that I keep reminding him is like, I'm trying to give you millions of dollars so you can go spend time with your grandkids. I want you to get millions of dollars so you can go spend time with your grandkids, right? Like, help me help you. Like, keep reminding him the goal, right? And, like, why you're doing this. And later on they'll—like, you know, what Steve just said. So I think all good stuff. That book is coming in handy for how to do negotiation and get the most out of people also. Nice one, Jason. Good luck. Keep us posted. I know you're in constant contact with Ryan, too.

Ryan: I think also, Jason, like, your persistence is winning him over, right? Like, I think it's a bit of his personality to kind of throw up these, like, these hurdles for you to jump, and when he sees that you are actually going to jump a few, he just kind of keeps that up, knowing that Jason will keep this going, right? Um, I think that's kind of a little bit of where he's at, so I think you're winning in that regard.

Athena: Thanks. Nice, cool, good stuff. All right. I see Andrew is here and he's got a really interesting situation on his hand. So I wanted to spotlight and talk through some of that because we haven't had a lot of these opportunities. So, Andrew, tell us what's going on with this new hot deal in your hands.

[00:38:10]
Andrew: Um, yeah, so we kind of came across an off-market deal, um, through a connection of Athena's, I believe, and that made our way to it, which is—it's effectively a CRM business for loan officers. Um, and it is a very, very good product that was built on the back of a marketing professional that's been in the mortgage industry for a long time—very prominent in both U.S. and Canada. Um, short end of the story: he has a good reputation behind him and can go into a room, sell a room, built an AI-powered CRM business that's really taken off. Um, the actual age of the business is around 10 years, but the actual age of the product is less than 3—it's on its 3rd year, or, I guess, 4th year now—and it's had a pretty meteoric rise. So it's one of those things you can't look back at the historical figures of it and get a good grip for what it's going to do during a good season and a bad season. Um, it's seen a pretty meteoric rise in a, frankly, a declining market as inventory has shrunk in a lot of markets—most markets, I'd say—along with rising interest rates that have seen a lot of mortgage loan officers get out of the business because they didn't have the capacity to keep their deal flow up. Anyways, it's a really unique opportunity and me and the seller speak the same language very much. So, um, Ryan was on that call with us and it went really, really well. Um, the issue now is, well, it's twofold. He's got kind of two different paths in front of him. He can go to a strategic and basically sell the product, knowing that the team will probably be in some way, shape or form, uh, you know, gotten rid of or downsized at a minimum—or let someone like myself take it over and kind of continue on the path that he saw. He is a builder, he is not a grower, so to speak. So he has built this business. He enjoys the field. He doesn't enjoy the people management back end to the growth—what comes along with growth. So all that to say, the challenging things about it are, A, that it's probably a bit above my—what I had been considering from a price standpoint, along with the fact that it's not a U.S.-based business and will not qualify for SBA financing. Now, 95—actually, 97 percent of the business is from the U.S., so it's not a—it is a Canadian-based business, but the business is in the U.S. So it kind of raises a lot of opportunities of, A, how to get it financed, um, B, validating the product and its longevity, and C, making sure it can survive without a guy who’s pretty much been the point person for that business since the original business originated 10 plus years ago.

Athena: So, like, super exciting. Also some complications, right? We're not used to, but in terms of, like, your skill set alignment for you—like, understanding that business—it feels like a really great—

Andrew: Oh, yeah, it is. It definitely is. My skill set fits in very well to the opportunity and I could absolutely—you know, if this fit is, you know, if this was a square peg, square hole situation in the U.S. that would qualify for SBA financing, we wouldn't be talking about it. They'd already have an offer into hands. But just the factor of, you know, getting debt on something—there's a pretty good chance that it's going to be somewhere between that 6 to 7.5 million dollar range. So, not only does it not qualify for SBA, but it's even above and beyond the SBA could do and have to pull in some mezz—it just gets a little bit more complicated. So, trying to figure that out. Um, he is willing to do some degree of seller financing. It was—walked in the door—basically offering 20%, which is great. I had kind of modeled out, um, not really with a purpose, just thinking through it, closer to that 40–50% seller finance. Um, and Ryan and I had a kind of strategy call after that original call yesterday and kind of got the game plan together to—assuming we check on the back end and everything looks good in the software itself—presenting him with two or three options and trying to see which path he would potentially buy in on—whether that's a, you know, some combination of 100 percent seller finance deal where he, you know, and maybe he even retains some equity in the deal; some combination of, you know, buy out a percentage of it and him stay on some form of—I've got just three different avenues I'm going to maybe chase down with him. I'm pretty hesitant, based off of sound advice from Ryan and Athena, as far as signing up for a partnership. So I don't know that that's necessarily my first choice, but I do think that there's some alignments here that would validate that consideration. So, yeah, that's where I'm at.

Athena: Cool. Super exciting. Um, so if it were SBA financeable, you could do pari passu. It would—you know, like, it qualifies for that in terms of the numbers and how it's performed and that sort of thing. So, um—

Andrew: Actually, let me ask you this real quick. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to cut you off. Let me ask you that because, I mean, if you look at the EBITDA—I mean, you look three years ago—you're talking about 100,000 EBITDA that's grown to three years. So, if you look at the trailing three, I have a feeling that's pretty hard for a bank loan committee to get over that, even if it did—even if it was U.S.-based business and you need to go for the SBA. So, if it were U.S.-based, what would an SBA lender say about that? That's pretty meteoric rise.

Athena: Yeah, and there are lenders that are more comfortable with—this is a high-growth business. There are lenders going to be more comfortable with—you know, I'm assuming it's airball and maybe there's some IP in the, the, um, the CRM system and the tech and the code and that sort of thing. But, um, they can get comfortable with it depending on who they are. So that's why we like to have a whole range of lenders that we work with, because some aren't going to be comfortable with that, other ones are. Um, and, you know, they might just do a 12-month look-back to see if the business could service the debt over the last 12 months rather than the last three years. So, you know, depending on the lender, they are comfortable with that. So just for everybody's kind of usefulness. Um, and I think also from this conversation, because it unlocks some tools maybe that we haven't had a chance to talk about before for you: if a business is not able to be funded by SBA for whatever reason—right? So in this case, the entity itself is based in Canada, even though 97 percent of its customers are American—bummer, right? Because now SBA can't finance it because it's not a U.S.-based business. There are other instances where a business might not qualify for SBA funding for whatever reason, in which case, if you were to buy the business and figure out some options—which we'll talk about in a second—and have the business for two years, then you can usually go and refi and do an SBA loan. So if we can find a way for you to get a hold of that business and bring it into the U.S. for two years, you would then be able to get your SBA loan—sometimes less time, you know, like, depending on the lender. And that's that whole thing. So, like, if it's a year of it being a U.S. entity, and they have tax returns in Canada, sometimes they'll do that, but it's like a U.S. entity now. Um, so what we want to do is like, okay, well, if we know that we could potentially get a total SBA loan in two years' time, how do we solve for that first two years? Or what are our options when SBA isn't an option? Now, we're in that kind of like—there's private debt, which is essentially investors that put capital into businesses as debt. So it is still an investment play. But rather than them getting equity, they are going to charge interest and still analyze it as they would an investment. Um, there is also 100 percent seller financing. So if we can make it sweet enough for this guy to hold the note for the first two years, then we could get him completely bought out in year two—or maybe even sooner, depending on the lender—with, you know, being able to then access SBA financing because you brought it into the U.S. Um, so there's kind of three options in this instance. First—which is my favorite, and ideal in these scenarios—get the seller to hold the note and you'll be able to, you know, get him a full exit in two years and get SBA financing. A second option, which may or may not be accessible—now normally private debt like to see enterprise value north of 10 million. You're a little bit on that smaller edge, but you could potentially have some conversations with private debt. You're going to be looking at an interest rate of around 11 to 15%. Last time I had that conversation. It is a higher interest rate because it is a much bigger risk to private investors than it is a lender having SBA-backed money, right? So that's why that interest rate is higher—because you're dealing with, you know, probably a fund of private investors that are putting capital into businesses. When you do—and if we do make those introductions to private debt—you essentially need to act as, like, an independent sponsor. You need to have your investment deck ready. You need to essentially pull together a SIM of information and know that deal backwards and forwards before you get introduced to them. It's a little bit different than, like, lenders—SBA lenders—which are much happier for you to kind of have bits and pieces here and there as you go through it. So, if you think of, like, raising investment—it's that interaction. And they're looking at you because you're not going to be putting a personal guarantee. If they're giving you money, that's one of the upsides of private capital in that sense. But you need to, like, seriously know this deal backwards, forwards, inside out, and have all those materials ready for them to analyze and take to their investors. So it's a lot of work for you to get to that point to get ready to have those conversations with them. And then door number three is a bunch of individual investors. Um, and, you know, you get him to take that 40 to 50 percent note, you make up the difference and get individual investors to act as, like, private capital. Ideally, not giving them equity because we don't want them to have that, but doing the same kind of play that you would with a professional private capital lender and instead go to friends and family and be like, hey, I'm going to offer you this interest rate, etc., etc. So then we have three kind of options. But my favorite and ideal in this scenario, I think, is trying to get him to take a note for the whole amount if you can, or trying to, you know, get as much as you can together of it, get that to him at close, and then have him take a note for the rest. And then he gets a complete balloon at two years, and then you can even—because you don't have SBA in the mix—you can build in earnouts and all sorts of fancy incentive structures to keep him in the business and help you get it to a good place so that at the time of two years, if the business is performed, you know, in the way that you both agreed, you can give him even more money and get it completely bought out with SBA at that point. Um, with the private lender situation, I highly doubt that they would be okay with you buying them out after two years because that's the whole point, right? But often the terms are going to be, like, shorter—also, not a lot of them are going to be cool with, like, a 10-year—and the percentage rate is going to be higher. So it's just a more expensive form of capital and they're not necessarily going to be like, yeah, like, go to SBA after two years and buy us out because they're not necessarily going to get the return that way. Um, and then private investors—you know, individuals—if you know enough friends and family, whatever, then you might be able to go to them that way and not give away equity. If it's, like, outside of friends and family, then you might have to give away equity at that point in order to make play number two, which is seller financing. You basically need to do what Renan did and get it so this guy sees you as the only logical buyer for his business—like, he couldn't imagine selling to anyone else. And then after that point, then you can be like, Hey, here's my problem: your business is in Canada, I'm in the U.S., I'm kind of handicapped with my capital options. So you can sell to a strategic, but what are they going to do—your team, your name, your product? They're not going to look after it the way that I do. You need to get him to see you as the person to hand this thing over to because builders don't want to see their things die either. So you need to incentivize them enough from, like, financial aspects. And it's like, if you sell to a strategic, they're still going to have you in the business for two years. They're going to put you in an earnout situation. So what we can do is seller finance—you’re going to get payments every single month. And if you get the business to a certain point that we agree and help me get it there, I'm going to pay you even more. And I'm going to be able to balloon you out in two years—maybe even earlier.

Andrew: No, and I think that there could even be a blend between that—well, you kind of said it—that, you know, that two-year hold-off before I could refi into an SBA, individual investors. Because I think I can—he's been pretty clear up to this point he doesn't necessarily need a fat check, but everyone says that until you realize you're not gonna get a fat check at all, and it's just gonna be small checks over the course of the next 24 months. So I think that there could be a combination of—you know, I feel pretty confident about my ability to raise, you know, 20–30% of that figure. Um, I probably would maybe need some coaching around that. I default to wanting to give a little bit of equity because I feel like that's the right thing to do. Of course, assuming that's with the right partners and everything like that and the right step up, right? But, um, I think I could get there. I think I could make it a win for him financially in the short term and a win for him in the long term. Um, and I would definitely—you know, I'm the kind of person that wants to make sure that he's financially incentivized. We've a purchase price today, but at the end of the day, when he gets to cash out all those chips, I want that number to be more because I think that's the right thing to do.

Athena: Which is so cool—like, if you're using SBA, you can't do that. Right now, you can't do a performance-based note. If you were to—let's say it was a U.S. entity—you wouldn't be able to give him a performance-based note because he has that growth, growth, growth. We don't have a former high-performing year that we could have as a peg. So, in this instance, you're able to incentivize him like private equity would be able to, to help you grow the business even more. And you will be able to do the SBA play at two years because you've had it and you'll be able to show, you know, two years—I think some lenders might even be less. So there's two big homework assignments for you right now. One is you got to develop the relationship of all relationships with this guy. And I told Ryan—I'm sure he conveyed it to you—I would be getting on a plane to Canada to show him how serious you are and start developing that relationship, right? Like, if you love this business and the only thing holding you back is the financing, then developing that relationship, showing him you're serious and getting him to see you as the only potential person to take this over is going to set you up well for whatever your finance options end up being down the line. And then, as you're doing that, you know, I think we can shoot for the seller financing, but you should be preparing that you might have to go and shop this around. In which case, you need to start getting your investment materials together. So, you know, we have a guy that writes SIMs for brokers—could put you in touch with him. I think you're actually more than capable of putting that together with our help, but you need to, like, work the relationship and get enough information that you could put everything you need to in the investment deck.

Ryan: Yeah, and I—we're on the way to what Athena just said as well, because I was planning on sending you a message later, Andrew. Um, but I messaged him yesterday asking if, hey, if you could grant us, like, some customer access so that you could pick around the site. And he responded this afternoon and said, um, he's like, I would be happy to do it on a video call with Andrew. The more time we spend together, the better. So he's already—he's already showing he wants to spend more time with you—is exactly what Athena was saying. So that sets us up pretty well.

Andrew: Yeah, that was a big factor of it—why we're even still talking about it. I would have been not hot off the trail had we not had a good rapport on that call. I mean, I had some ideas that he hadn't thought about—how to grow the business—and we really do talk the same language and he wants someone like me to grow this thing and someone that's got the energy to go take it off. So, um, there's some pretty good alignments to start a pretty good relationship. So I'm hopeful. I'm cautiously optimistic, but this is—that's good. I mean, we're working towards it.

Athena: Yeah. And your leadership and training—like all of those—because you're right, builders don't like the minutia of managing teams and leadership and that's the stuff you excel at. So keep reminding him of that too, you know. Like, you are the right person to take over this business. Lock yourself into that and then get him to see that too. And then the rest of this is just figuring out the logistics. But when we do get enough information, if we need to, I can introduce you to those private capital providers, and they're going to be looking at you—your ability to run this business. Like, you're a great fit for this business. I just need to make sure that you have enough information about how it all goes together if we were to access some of those other financing sources and make sure you're starting off from a good place. Instead of, you know, lenders—you can be a little bit like, hey, this is what's going on, and they're like, cool. But, like, you know, just think of private capital as an investment play.

Andrew: And if there's a business where I could speak intelligently on to those type of lenders, it's basically—

Athena: Exactly, which is why I'm saying this is a play that we can unlock for you. It's not for everything and it has to be something, like, lock solid for you—the owner, the business, you know. So—but it is a bit in the smaller range. So we just want to make sure we're getting you set up and I still think that two-year seller finance could be a great option.

Andrew: Me too. I've got some aces up my sleeve, too, that I could kind of—so I've—we've got some options, but I, you know, like you said, I don't want to get too fast—too fast. I want to get, you know, got to get a peek underneath the hood, keep developing the relationship and really kind of start playing out some scenarios. But, um, I've got to hop on here, guys. They're—waiting on me. I'm so sorry.

Athena: We'll look forward to seeing your plane ticket to Canada.

Andrew: I like that, I agree. I agree. Nice. Cool.

Athena: All right. Thanks guys. It's exciting. Ryan and the team are here for you too.

Andrew: Yeah. I appreciate it, guys. Thank you.
