Additional notes/patterns
- Acronym/name confusions recur (SBA→SBL; CAD→TAB; Chris Voss/Elliott Holland misheard). Consider boosting ASR vocabulary for SMB M&A terms and notable industry names.
- Currency context is critical in this call; ensure CAD/USD references are captured accurately to avoid valuation/modeling errors.
- SIM/CIM capitalization inconsistency likely benign but worth standardizing for clarity.
