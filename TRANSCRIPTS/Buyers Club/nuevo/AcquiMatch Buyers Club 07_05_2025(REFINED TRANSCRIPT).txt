[00:00:00]
Athena: Hello. Hey Gil. How's it going? Hey Steve. Nice to see you. Hey Peter. Welcome everyone. This is, uh, Peter. He is, uh, excited—he can start June 1st. So we're opening up Buyers Club to folks while we're going through the onboarding process.

Good to see you, Peter. We've got, uh, Chris and Polly also here. And then the rest of the faces that you're seeing are, uh, AcquiMatch team. So Anka, Luke, Kate, David, all part of the team. So excited for today. Sounds like a couple of you have some good deals in the works. Um, Peter, for your knowledge, typically what we do is on Tuesdays we'll be talking through like deals, active things that people are working on, and then usually on Thursdays we'll bring in an external [00:01:00] expert, uh, or a business buyer or something like that.

So on Thursday we've actually got Wendy from Live Oak, who's gonna be coming talking through more. Uh, I'm gonna be leading the questions more on what the process looks like on the backend so you guys can understand from a lender's perspective what they're going through, what they look at, what they have to go and fight on your behalf on in terms of a deal when they go to the credit team, that sort of thing.

So if you have any questions specifically for, um, how the process works behind the scenes, and you have a lender, as we all know, we love Wendy. She's very open to talk about that sort of thing. Um, just be thinking of those questions 'cause on that call I'm gonna be, it's a fireside chat, but I want you all to come with your questions too.

But today, hey, Justin's here too. Um, today wanted to chat through, uh, some of the deals that you have all going on. If there's any questions, uh, or challenges that you're facing, we can talk through that here on the group. And it's also helpful for everybody else to hear kind [00:02:00] of what you're going through, what challenges you're facing, how you're solving those.

Um, and yeah. So Gil, I wanted to start with you because you've got a live one. So we're redlining an LOI on a business we're really excited about for you. Uh, and we've come up on a challenge around working capital, which is the bane of my existence and everyone's existence. So if you just wanna give us a quick recap on the deal and where you're at right now, and then we can dive into how we could potentially overcome this little challenge that we're having on the working capital side of things for you.

Signing why. 

[00:02:40]
Gil: Um, so the deal is for a business that, uh, does trade shows of booths, it, it designs and builds them out and rents them out and stores them for future use. Uh, it's based out of Pennsylvania. About two hours away from me. Uh, had a meeting with the owner about two weeks ago. Uh, meeting went very well.

I got a call a week later from the broker saying, if you wanna move forward with me and [00:03:00] that, uh, they'll be sending me an LOI. Uh, then, uh, three days later, he asked for a Word version of the LOI. Uh, three days after that I got a redline. I sent the redline to Bill from, uh, Barlow Williams. Yeah, thank you. Uh, he said everything's okay. Uh, and it is, he has, it's okay. Not great, but it's okay. Uh, my only issue there is with the change they made to the working capital, uh, instead of, uh, they, they limited it to 30 days, uh, of working capital. And when I emailed the broker about it, uh, his response was that, uh, it's normalized working capital, that's an average of the trailing 12 months. Um, and, uh, actually be getting the money from the SBA basically. Uh, so that was his, uh, his, [00:04:00] his take. Uh, I told him, thank you. I'll be talking to my team today and I'll get back to you. So I'm not really sure how to approach this now. 

[00:04:20]
Athena: Yeah. So, uh, this is, this is one of those frustrating things that we're at right now with like the old school brokers and the, the, the new rigor that we all bring to this process.

So, um, we're bringing kind of like middle market processes down a little bit, uh, into small business land, um, and working capital in, in our LOI template. And what we always try to push for with clients is, is net working capital without putting a number to it at the LOI stage, because we're gonna be doing a Quality of Earnings report, and that's gonna determine how much working capital we need to keep the business running from the day we take it over to when the next client check hits our account because there's that drag.

So the analogy that I use, uh, is like if you're buying a vending machine [00:05:00] business, right? And you show up and it's just a bunch of vending machines without any inventory in them, you're gonna have to go out and purchase all that inventory. So you basically just bought equipment, you didn't buy a business.

So working capital is a way, you know, these businesses that we're buying wouldn't be able to function without having the working capital that they had. So they've built up their working capital to a certain point that allows them to operate at the level that they do. Well, what typically happens in, in old school broker land, and what he said, which makes me laugh, but it's, it's not funny, right?

But it just makes me laugh. And he is like, the SBA is gonna be giving you working capital anyway. It's like, well, no, they're not giving it to me. I pay for it. I pay interest on it. Right? So like, it's not just given, it's like I've got to pay for that working capital. Um, so the way that we, when we do the financial modeling on these businesses, we're [00:06:00] accounting for net working capital being included.

We're making the assumption that we need to take over the business on day one. There's gonna be enough working capital in the business for you to be able to pay the bills that you're gonna have from day one until the first client check comes through. Now, with this business in particular, we actually have the, uh, aging reports to an extent, and it appears as if 70% of the accounts receivable are over 30 days, but the broker's out like saying 30 days working capital. So we have a couple different options in this scenario. Um, my preference if we're not, and, and there's so many variables with every deal, like how competitive are other buyers in the mix? How bad do you want it?

Like, how good of a relationship do we think we can build afterwards? Um. You know, is, is the broker gonna be a problem at this stage and we can kind of [00:07:00] move them out of the way and develop that relationship with the seller and help them understand the situation. Or do we use the banks or the QoE report as the kind of bad guys and renegotiate and retrade later, so many options that we can have.

You know, my preference is always operating from a place of full transparency and integrity. Uh, you know, which all of you are too. So it's like, well, look, I value the business based on, on there being net working capital. So if you're telling me that only 30 days of working capital is necessary to operate the business for as long as it takes for me to start getting the checks that will cover the bills, then as long as it checks out that way, when the bank looks at it, and when the QoE report comes back, then I'm willing to do that.

So we can operate from a, you know, I, I, I trust you're saying that's what's needed here. Knowing that there's gonna be both the bank and banks, right? 'cause you're gonna go look at term sheets and they're [00:08:00] gonna tell you what working capital that they would feel comfortable with. Your QoE report's actually gonna determine what the net working capital number is.

Um. And you know, then in the purchase agreement, you're gonna be determining even deeper what of the accounts receivable you'll be getting, right? Because you don't want the stuff that's like old that hasn't been collected. Um, so like which parts, uh, like which accounts you actually get is gonna matter too.

So there's gonna be a lot of negotiations around this point post LOI. So then it's like, well, how much do we want to belabor the point and try to educate a broker that's working off the assumption that the SBA just gives you money. Right.

I'm sorry that makes me giggle, but I, I, I, I think you've heard me tell this story 'cause Gil Gil's on almost every Buyers Club, which I love, but you know, when I was at the Texas Association of Business Brokers Conference last year, and I, I, [00:09:00] I was like, oh my God. Like, am I at a, you know, like retired brokers event?

No. Like. The majority of brokers are, are aged, you know, 65 plus. They love paper calendars. They, you know, in handshakes and that's how they do business. And it used to be that like, it's just cash free debt-free business sales. So there was this whole session, they do educational CE sessions at this, at these conferences.

And the tab event, apart from the, um, like national brokers event that happens every year. Tab is like the largest, um, group of business brokers that get together and have an association, the Texas one. And there was a, a working capital session that I was in and I was like, looking around and I was like, how are we teaching this at a business broker event when these guys have been doing this for 20, 30 years?

And they were all grumbling at the beginning and they're like, cash free, debt free. I'm not giving any working capital [00:10:00] raw, you know, and then the guy does this session at the end they were like. Wow. You know, like their minds were changed and I was like, how are we, like how have we been doing this for a couple decades?

And you're just under, so I, I give that context because a lot of the brokers are operating off the cash free, debt free. Well, you did the valuation based on net working capital being included, so you have some options here. You try to negotiate the purchase price or bring it back down on the assumption that you're gonna have to provide working capital without having all the AR reports to really, truly determine what that might be.

Or we agree to the 30 days because at least there's something in there, knowing that you're gonna have both the banker and the report to be able to point to later and hopefully have developed a relationship with the seller at that point where you can also explain the concept to her. Or you [00:11:00] can try to argue it now and try to get the full, you know, the net working capital and potentially, you know, risk this deal not getting signed.

So what's your gut telling you is the right move right now? 

[00:11:20]
Gil: Um, I don't think the broker will budge. Mm-hmm. Uh, he changed it and he's fighting me on it already. Um, I think even if I get on a call with him, uh, I won't be as, I don't know if I'll be as fluent as you right now, uh, explaining this to him. Uh, and I'm afraid that I'm gonna stumble over over what I'm, what I'm trying to say.

Yeah. Uh, practice this, you know, but I, I still don't think it's gonna be, uh, the way that I want it to be. Uh, I'm leaning towards, uh, developing a relationship with a seller and then, uh. Doing it that way. But, uh, I think that you and I were [00:12:00] chatting on Slack yesterday. I don't want to get into a situation where I'm starting a QoE and then the deal falls apart 'cause of working capital.

Right. Uh, how, my question is, how exact are the banks going to be in giving me a working capital number? How far off would it be from a, from a full blown blown QoE? 

[00:12:25]
Athena: Yeah, I mean, so, uh, it's a great question for Wendy on Thursday, right? How they look at working capital and what they wanna see, because the bank doesn't wanna see bankrupt yourself when you take over the business, right?

So the first thing, and Wendy's really good about this, and she always on a deal, she's like, I wanna see. The aging reports like right now, right? Like, um, and it'll probably be a monthly aging report by client rather than what they're doing and that sort of thing. And um, so she's really good at actually digging in there and trying to really understand what they want to see the working capital number at.

Now the bank [00:13:00] will either just add it in addition to your deal or you go back and renegotiate it with the seller. So they're gonna tell you what amount that they think needs to be there, and then it's up to you on whether you renegotiate it or you pay more money for the deal to make sure that you have your working capital needs covered.

But, um. You'll get a pretty good sense from the bank. And then also, you know, 30 days is like how much you're gonna need to cover bills for 30 days. So it might be that they're on net 30 with their, their clients and they're just not good at following up and getting paid within 30 days. So that's another thing that we don't have visibility on right now is like, what's their payment terms with clients, we don't have enough information related to exactly determine whether 30 days is enough.

Broker knows that, right? So it's like he's just putting his client in a situation to be renegotiated with when there's a lot more firepower in the mix in terms of the bank [00:14:00] and the QoE report. When you get under the hood and you start looking at like, well what are the, like you're gonna ask for client contracts, you're gonna look at payment terms, you're gonna look at how they're, you know, collecting that money, how like outdated it is.

So if they're on 30 day payment terms. Fantastic. You know, because then, then it's just a matter of they're not collecting like on, on 30 days. She probably has this like really nice relationship with her clients and they're like, oh, pay when you can, or whatever. If they're on net 60 or net 90, then we have an issue, right?

Because he is saying, we'll give you 30 days of working capital, but she, you take 90 days to get paid, so you're gonna have to make up that 60 day, um, working capital deficiency to be able to take over the business, in which case we'll remodel it, we'll put it all into the model. And that's why we have like, what are the working capital needs?

What are they leaving in the deal? And then you'll see, you know, we should be adjusting the purchase price down to account for that so that [00:15:00] your cash to you doesn't change. 

[00:15:05]
Gil: Yeah. Okay. So, um, so some, sometimes 

[00:15:10]
Athena: it's easier not to try to belabor the point with them and educate them on working capital. We just adjust the purchase price.

[00:15:20]
Gil: I, I, I'm more than comfortable doing that. Yeah. Um, yeah, yeah, I'm, I'm, I'm comfortable doing that. I think, do I give him a heads up that this might be coming his way or do I just say, I talked to my team, uh, we agreed to 30 days. Uh, it might re, uh, do I, do I say it might require renegotiation? Uh, once, once we understand what net working capital is?

Or do I Not even, I 

[00:15:45]
Athena: wouldn't, I wouldn't because he sounds a little, he sounds a little like, um,

old school and aggressive, so I would be like, you know,

I would allude to it, but I wouldn't say it directly at this point. 

[00:16:00]
Gil: Okay. All 

[00:16:02]
Athena: right. That's, and that's maybe not necessary. You, ultimately, [00:16:00] you need to decide what the best play is. 'cause you have the relationship with him and you know, you have the interactions with him. But just know whatever's in the LOI if it comes back that it's materially different and what you need, like you, you have the opportunity to retrade and you have the reality that, that the deal might fall apart if you guys are completely far off from what the numbers are.

'cause it's, it's, you've decided to make an offer on the business based on what the numbers look like with net working capital. If what they're offering and what you actually need are so far off that it like, puts you at a massive change in the, um, um, the cash flow to you. Then you need to make a decision on whether it's worth proceeding at that point.

[00:16:45]
Gil: Yeah, okay. That makes sense. 

[00:16:48]
Athena: So I just, you know, like they have one business to sell. Yeah, you, you want to buy a business right now. You would like to buy their business under the right circumstances, but if the circumstances end up putting you at a massive financial disadvantage based on what you thought it was, then you need to have the real [00:17:00] conversation with yourself on whether you want to do that.

And you don't have to spend any money to get to that point. You can, you know, put this deal in front of a couple lenders. They're gonna ask for certain documents from the seller to be able to determine that sort of thing. And then you can say how much working capital they think they need. Is it massively far off from what they're offering?

If so, we can have a conversation about, do we have this conversation now before you spend money on a QoE, or is it close enough to what they're offering that Okay, the QoE should come back in and around what, what they said. Now, something that I've heard from multiple people, it always makes me chuckle, is like, you know, you've hit the right working capital number when both parties are a little disappointed.

[00:17:40]
Gil: That makes sense. Yeah. 

[00:17:45]
Athena: Um, Steve, were you gonna add something or did you have a question?

[00:17:50]
Steve: Uh, so yeah, I actually just wanna dig in on [00:18:00] something that Gil said, uh, and, and just kind of reminded me of a best practice myself I'm gonna take up. But Gil, you mentioned about having the fluent conversation like Athena has about working capital. I can't do that. Uh, but when I worked. A long time ago when I spent a bunch of time on Wall Street, uh, what we would do is when, you know, a position came in, you had to sell that position to folks, wrote a script out.

And by writing it out, physically writing it, you're learning it. You have to understand what you're writing to actually write it. And then, you know, the first time you read that, you read the script out loud. The first time you present it to somebody, it's clunky. It's this and that. By the 50th time, man, you could just say it like there's no tomorrow.

And that, that's, that's where I think I'm gonna do the same thing. 'cause working capital seems to be coming up a lot and I don't wanna get stumped in the middle of it. Where, where my thoughts at. If you've got that, that framework and that script, and you've said it a hundred times 'cause you're gonna probably have this conversation, not with just these people, but everybody it seems, 'cause I know we've seen, we've run into that as [00:19:00] well.

[00:19:05]
Gil: Yeah. Thanks Steve. That's, that's good advice. Uh, I'll definitely do that. Um, I think I'll also use, uh, uh, some AI to start to, to simulate a conversation and see how that goes. 

[00:19:20]
Athena: It's, it's a great point from Steve and also I love GPT for these scenarios. 'cause you can actually feed it the broker comms, right.

And it'll pick up on how the broker's like communicating and stuff, you know? So, um, you know, something you could say is like, well, I, I did the, um, offer based on net working capital. Would you like me to present you with a new offer? Cash free, debt free? You know? Mm-hmm. That will obviously be less on the, the purchase price in that regard.

Um, so I think, you know, because he's held you back from the seller, honestly, I think developing more of a relationship with her because it sounded like you guys got along really well. You [00:20:00] really like this business. You think you can probably come to terms that when you have a strong relationship with her and she wants you to be the buyer.

That this conversation will be a lot easier post LOI after you've developed that relationship and she sees no other error to her legacy, right? When you do a really good job building that relationship, understanding the business, giving her confidence, you're gonna be a great owner. Um, but here's another thing, Gil.

There's gonna be a lot of these conversations and negotiations and conversations you don't feel comfortable with, or most of us are conflict avoidant and don't, don't wanna go up against someone like him. Um, so you're just kind of delaying the learnings by not having it. At this point too, we're thinking against say is no.

[00:20:55]
David: Yeah, 

[00:20:56]
Athena: it's good practice. 'cause as a business owner, like you're gonna have a lot of. Shitty conversations you don't want to have and you don't feel equipped for either. So I like, I, I listen to a lot of Lela Homo and she's like, you're gonna get the lesson one way or another. [00:21:00] So it's, it's whether you want to delay the lesson or the learning, 'cause you, you know, it's coming.

Um, so you might be able to script it out with GPT and just say like, Hey. So I, I'm, I'm sorry. I thought we had a misunderstanding. In the sim you put, you know, an amount of, of working capital that was necessary. So I did the modeling off of, you know, net working capital being included. We obviously don't know exactly what that number is yet, which is why I put net working capital in.

Um, so if you'd like me, I can, I, I can adjust and make an assumption on what I think working capital is at this point, but, you know, how do you normally, you can almost like lean on him, like how do you normally determine this when, you know, I'm buying a vending machine business, not the vending machine equipment.

So obviously I'm gonna need some stuff in there to be able to operate and pick up on day one. Um, so I actually modeled this based on the assumption that we're, we're putting whatever net working capital is in there. When I'm [00:22:00] looking at the AR reports that you sent, I, I'd say about 70% of the accounts receivable is over 30 days. So obviously that makes me a little bit nervous. Um, you know, where can you tell me where you got the 30 day number from? Maybe alleviate some of my concerns when I'm seeing 70% is over 30 days. Does she have 30 day payment terms and she just needs to tighten up her, her, you know, collections of the fees or you know, so like, almost rather than making it confrontational, I would just like, ask some questions, let him know where some of your concerns are, how you valued it, and see what solutions he might have for you there.

[00:22:40]
Gil: Okay. Um, I can do that. Um, I. I'm not afraid to pick up the phone and talk to someone. Um, and 

[00:22:52]
Athena: it's scripted it out though, like, you know, so like, script out and you can take the transcript from, from this call too. I think Anka, we can get it up pretty quickly today [00:23:00] to help Gil out. Um, so you can pull the Fathom transcript, feed that in the GPT, feed the brokers thingy, put the LOI in there, give it the context and be like, I'm a little uncomfortable because he is wanting me to set the number of days for working capital.

I wanna call in, like, I'm thinking I approach it like this. Can you help me with a script or some talking points? 

[00:23:25]
Gil: Yeah, yeah, I can do that. Um, I just lost my train of thought. I was gonna say something. Uh, yes. Um, let's assume that he comes back to me in, in this conversation and says, no, I'm sticking to my guns. It's 30 days of working capital. Do I say. Thank you, but no thank you. Do I say, okay, I'll sign it. How do we negotiate later? How if he just sticks with his gun, then he's, and he's just being stubborn. Um, how do I extricate myself in that conversation and still sign the LOI with the [00:24:00] 30 day then we renegotiate later?

Or do I, yeah. 

[00:24:05]
Athena: Well, I mean, what do you want the outcome to be? Like? Do you love this business enough to, to have to potentially renegotiate later? 

[00:24:15]
Gil: I don't mind renegotiating later. I, I, I like this business. Do I love it? Not yet. I'm not, I'm not attached to it. Right. It's a good opportunity and it fits my skillset and it's the right price.

Um, geographically it sucks, but, okay, what can I do? Um, but it's a good business. Yeah. But I'm not, I'm not in love with it yet. I like it. Yeah. Okay, 

[00:24:40]
Athena: so then, then I would say you don't get what you don't ask for. So you can have a conversation with 'em and just like air your concerns, right? And like, Hey, you're the expert here.

How should I be looking at this? Like, you think 30 days is enough. I'm seeing 70% of our accounts receivable haven't been paid in in less than 30 days. So that makes me concerned that I'm gonna bankrupt myself when I take over this business. [00:25:00] And he is like, well, SBA gives you working capital. And be like, yeah, but that's in addition to what I factored in here.

So that means I'd be overpaying based on the, the purchase price that I gave you. So if you want, I can, I can, you know. See if he has solutions there. If he's like, no, 30 days at least he's giving you something here. Right? And you can, you can call it back later when you have some like, okay, I've spoken to lenders and they say this and we need to have a real conversation.

And at that point you either love the business or you don't, and you can decide whether you want to negotiate. That's the cool thing about LOIs is like it's non-binding and it gives you an opportunity to, it's basically access to look under the hood and get these questions answered. 

[00:25:45]
Gil: Yeah. Okay. Fair enough.

Cool. But it's still good 

[00:25:52]
Athena: practice to have the conversation, right? And like do it in a way, and I would ask GPT when you give it the prompt, be like this guy gets a little grisly, here's some of his responses. Right? So I wanna have this conversation in a way that, you know, it's collaborative and like, [00:26:00] Hey, I know you've got a tough job.

You need to protect your seller. I also need to protect myself. 'cause you know, I'm putting my livelihood and personal guarantee on the line. So I wanna make sure that we're not putting ourselves in a situation where we have to renegotiate this later. So I'd love to get this like, hashed out and get us in, in a good place here.

And he offered it to, to talk you through on a call. So sometimes I, I find that you can 'cause on, on email people can be mean, right? But when you, when you go at it and it's like confident, but, you know, just let me be open with you about my concerns. I wanna make sure that we're all on the same page and that, you know, we we're not looking at like having to do a bunch of renegotiation later.

Here's how I'm looking at it. Like, can you fill me in on why you think 30 days is enough, given 70% of the accounts receivable take more than 30 days to get paid at this point. Like, what's, do you know what her payment terms are like? 

[00:26:52]
David: Gimme 

[00:26:53]
Athena: some info that makes me less concerned about it. 'cause I'm just trying to protect myself and protect her business and, and you know, in that regard that I don't [00:27:00] bankrupt myself.

Cool. And then the worst thing, worst thing is like, he's like, no 30 days. And you're like, okay, well I guess we have to play that game then. You know, I'm just like, then you go to the lenders and they're like, you need 500,000. They're only offering 150. You go back to 'em and be like, we're gonna have to have a serious conversation about it.

At which point hopefully you developed a great relationship with the seller, you've decided whether you love the business or not, and it's just this working capital thing that we need to get figured out. 

[00:27:25]
Gil: Yeah. Okay. 

[00:27:28]
Athena: A lot of times sellers don't even understand the concept, right? Like it's the brokers that are arguing on their behalf.

So you can also get an understanding when you start getting to know her, whether she knows what it is or not. 

[00:27:40]
Gil: Yeah. I got involved in the conversation, so yeah. 

[00:27:45]
Athena: Make sure that the seller understands the concept of working capital. Um, yeah. And they understand what it is, what it means, all of it because, um, I have some clients where they thought they were on [00:28:00] the same page with the sellers, they bought the business and then the sellers really didn't understand how their books worked.

And it ended up being months of conversations and renegotiations to land at the exact same number that they set in the first place. But all that time and energy having to have the conversation. So also once you get past the LOI, you should be getting access to the owner because you need to be able to do your diligence and create a relationship and making sure that she understands the concept and what she's agreeing to.

Right. 

[00:28:30]
David: Yeah. 

[00:28:32]
Athena: Yeah. Cool. So you clear on next steps? You feeling alright? 

[00:28:38]
Gil: Yeah, yeah. I'm going to, uh. Take the points off of the, what we just talked about, um, and create a script for myself, uh, with, and not a script, but, and I don't do all scripts, but bullet points, um, of, of things that wanna mention to him and have a, a, a very civil, nice conversation with him and see where it leads, [00:29:00] you know, like I say, I, I'll ask him questions, I'll make him talk, you know, uh, and, uh, we'll see where it leads.

Listen. What's the worst that can happen? You know, the worst that can happen is they lose the steal. That's the worst thing that can happen, you know? Yeah. 

[00:29:18]
Athena: And you've got others, right? They only have one business to sell and, and or worst case, 30 days and you've got something at least, you know, um, then you can decide later whether that's something is enough for you to still be interested in it.

But, you know, best case, you get a lot of good experience having to have negotiation conversations and crunchy conversations, which is gonna set you up for, you're gonna have to do this on this deal or any other, right? There's, there's a lot of negotiation points and difficult conversations ahead, so it's good practice regardless.

Cool. Thank you. Nice. Cool. Keep us posted. This is exciting. Um, thanks Gil. Thank you. Cool. Chris, I saw you were [00:30:00] here. I was wondering if you wanted to chat through your updates on your off market and where you're at, uh, and if there's anything we can do to help. 'cause you are also in a timely LOI hopefully getting signed situation.

[00:30:15]
Athena: Can you hear me? Yeah, I see that. Yeah, 

[00:30:20]
Chris: I can hear you. 

[00:30:22]
Chris: Um, yeah, hopefully it won't, but, um, it went well. Uh, so I think for, for the benefit of all, uh, this has been in the work for a while, but, um, since I've been the quarterback, right, because, um, AcquiMatch brought it to me, then I've been sort of fielding it.

So I've met with them now anywhere from three to four times. So first to get to know us each other, then the operations, um, it's direct with the sellers, right? So no, no broker. Um, so that also means more work for me or me having to sort of. Whatever I do take a step back and sort of put myself in how they're gonna [00:31:00] receive that and anticipate some stuff or, or some possible concerns.

Um, and then I, after I saw that there was potential and they stated that they stated multiple times that they felt it was a good match and a good fit. So I traveled from Barcelona, which is where I normally am to the greater Boston area. 'cause I don't know if you're gonna know Mansfield, but, but it's like 40 minutes from, from Boston.

Um, and I spent, it was pretty cool. I spent, uh, I got there at one for the site visits, toured the, the main building, which is the main warehouse. It's a warehouse distributor. They've been in business for over 90 years. Um, and they distribute anything from big, uh, snow and ice removals to wheels and rims and, uh.

Trailer hitches and stuff like that. But it is a B2B, it's not, they do some retail, but it's mostly, uh, commercial. I think the [00:32:00] mechanic for a town or for a city, right? The garage that adds hundreds of, of units, ambulances or stuff like that. So fast forward, that went well, that the site visit at started at one, we ended up with beers like around 8:00 PM So that was, that was, that's a good sign, you know, spending six hours, seven hours with someone.

And, uh, yeah, I did a lot of the pre-work, uh, took a week and change to really nail down the LOI and, uh, we had a meeting yesterday to go over it. It went well. I, I took some of who just said I did a little, not a script, that's too verbatim, but. Key points that in case I, you know, I got stuck, I would bring, uh, and I sent that to them by the way.

'cause it was like apples to apples. Here's what exclusivity means. It means we're committed to each other for 90 days. That's, 'cause that's what I put in the LOI. Here's what this means. And then, um, sort of to test, if I really understood, I did a quick, uh, couple slides, which that's actually what I presented.

I showed the slides and like, Hey, let me, actually, this is a bit [00:33:00] tricky. Let me actually go into the LOI. Here you go. So that's what we did. I think it landed well. They also were honest, like, this is a lot, so we're gonna need at least 48 hours to digest it. But, um, you know, they asked some questions and, and so, um, sidebar said that it makes sense that the hardest part, and we both acknowledge this is the inventory.

So this is a heavy inventory business. They, that's the reason they're usually successful. They, they have stuff that maybe other competitors do not. And, uh, people find them, you know, sort of keep coming back 'cause of customer service and, and their availability of parts. That also means it's a lot of working capital discussions that we're gonna need to have as well.

And inventory and how do I buy it? Good sign is that they seem willing to work with me. They don't have like this advanced, they have an ERP system. So they do track their inventory and they can pull a report and tell me what's the value of what's in the books. But I don't know if it's like first [00:34:00] in, first out or last in, you know, like LIFO or FIFO, you know, whatever these fancy terms are for, you know, inventory.

And I don't think they do either. So we'll have to, you know, during Quality of Earnings and due diligence. So I've set up the stage, we will have to have these discussions and they've shown, um, openness to like either work in my favor or not. Um, so it seems good. I think where, you know, it might be tricky is, uh.

Getting them to agree. Right. I, I, I think we've anchored the purchase price since the site visit. I started with the psychological anchors. I left, I throw the numbers, so the number that I put wasn't a surprise. They had heard it from my mouth at least once. Um, they also, I called them directly prior, um, when I was, were doing this and told them the strategy.

So I'm trying to get two buildings from them to, um, or so that it's the 49 51 split. I explained that to them prior and then did it yesterday, and it was like, oh, this is why [00:35:00] he's proposing these numbers. Um, so it overall looks good. There was a curve ball, so I expect inventory to be, uh, some in working capital, something that it will come back.

I, I don't think we're done with it, but it will come back. I expect probably some pushback. I, uh, taking what Athena said, uh, you don't get what you don't ask for. I don't know if they'll bite, but my instinct, my gut, I put 50% seller carry. They didn't complain and I positioned it as they can make, uh, almost 200 K on it.

We'll see if they come back with, but they didn't seem upset. They didn't, you know, they didn't bite or, or that wasn't the part that they asked questions. So we'll see. I'm, I'm optimistic. Um, the part there is a curve ball. One of the properties, they did tell me in the call that they installed solar panels and they've been [00:36:00] having some issues with GEICO.

So they're like, if there is any legal, 'cause we're exploring some legal action against GEICO, you might wanna consider then buying some other properties from our portfolio so that this one doesn't stuck you. So I see it as a good faith. They're, they're early. Um, and I think we both, we, we've established transparencies from the beginning.

I think they've overshared stuff, which is why I've been able to come in from a position of like. An informed position. Um, but yeah, it was, uh, I was a bit nervous to be honest. Like I was, uh, had to prepare. I feel like I probably overthought a little bit. It's still too early to call it a win, but I, I think, you know, it will, I, I expect some outcome and I, and I'm hoping it's favorable, but that's, at least that's what I'm putting out there.

And then in rough timeline, I'm gonna honor 48 hours, 48 to 72 hours, which is what they ask for, to, to sort of sleep over it and, and come back with [00:37:00] comments. And then we're gonna, you know, we set a soft target of, of Monday or Tuesday to have another call and, and, you know, discuss their points. So that, that's my timeline, right.

We'll still know prior, you know, probably email Thursday this week or so, but, um, to land on that meeting. But, but that's what I expect. Pause there. Does that, I don't know. Does that make sense? No, that's great. Yeah, 

[00:37:20]
Athena: it's, it's really exciting and also good for everybody else to hear on off market. You're playing the role of broker and buyer, you know, so it's like they don't know the, you know, and, and we internally.

Um, you know, train the team and stuff like that when we're speaking to owners, to not spook them by using things like SDE and EBITDA and working, like, just, you know, talking in normal terms. So I think you've been doing an excellent job of like building a relationship with them, but also educating them on the, on the processes you go through it.

Because if you don't do that, then when the, the, [00:38:00] you know, family attorney or whoever gets involved, just like, ah, so you're helping 'em understand the concepts as you're walking it through, which is building trust, um, but also acknowledging that there's gonna be some areas that, that you guys will need to come to terms on.

Um, so over, I, I don't think you can ever over prepare for these kinds of things, especially when there's not a broker in the mix. So it's like, well, what do, what information did they need at this point? To make them a good seller to me. Right. The more information that they have about the process and what they're signing, the better seller they are to you.

Now, I will say at this point you kind of wanna be asking 'em like, Hey, do you guys have some attorneys that have done these types of transactions before? 

[00:38:40]
Chris: Yeah. Yeah. I've already not, so not an, it's a non-answer, but in the site visit, I already, so that was something I touched, is like, you're gonna need a lawyer for this.

And they're, they have a family, so it's the, the company lawyer. It's [00:39:00] probably not the best person. I might bring that up on the next one. What I did focus on this one was explaining to them, look, this is roughly what it's gonna look like once we agree. 'cause I, I, even the concept of this being non-binding, I said, I said, look, I.

I, I know you've been down this road at some point, but I don't know where you've been. So I just wanna clarify, this letter is not the end all, be all. We'll, we'll need to land on a purchase agreement here. It's called the definitive agreement. But what this does, it outlines where we start, right where we start and, and that we are agreed.

So the better job we do here, the better outcome we're gonna have at the end. That's how I positioned it. And I said, and um, anything that I put here is verifiable. You can go to your CPA, you can go to someone and you can verify. 'cause I, I did pitch some, like tax benefits if they have a seller carry. I pitched some like, uh, something I didn't mention and I, I said to Athena my, my response to them.

But they came back this, I [00:40:00] think earlier today. It's late for me, but, um, I wanna say it was earlier, earlier Eastern time and they told me, they asked about the structure, if it could be, uh, instead of an asset purchase, if it could be a stock sale or a stock purchase in. Yeah, obviously I prefer an asset purchase, but I had to think, so I structure a response.

Um, I didn't mention purchase price, like in adjusting it, which I know that that's what I would change, but I try to explain to them, here's the, how it protects us. You know, it protects me and I'm trying to position it as a, being a better steward of the business because they, they, we are aligned in how to grow the business.

They, they're the ones sort of informing it of where they think it, it should grow and they not having the energy to do it, like, but I want to use their insight. So I think that's sort of where I'm gonna place, like, look, if I can re-depreciate assets, it's more runway for the business. It's beneficial from a tax perspective.

And I can then [00:41:00] reinvest, you know, in those plans that we're exploring. Yeah. So that's, 

[00:41:05]
Athena: I would normally do in that situation. Um, and this is more of a sales tactic, right? So when people ask for things like that, be like, Hey, you know, it's totally reasonable. Ask, can I, can you tell me more about why you're asking for that or why that's important to you?

[00:41:20]
David: Mm-hmm. 

[00:41:22]
Athena: I would start there before, like, 'cause your answer to them was very good, but I wanna understand where it's coming from. Who's advising? Like, did, is there some silent advisor in the background telling them that? Where did they get this idea? Why is it important to them? And then I can redirect my answer to like, overcome the objection or to answer this specific reason why they're asking for it.

[00:41:45]
Chris: I have a, a gut feel because of the site visit and the relationship I built and I think is, is, is no one, I [00:42:00] don't think anyone's advising it. Maybe now someone will. But I think it has to do more with the person that asks it. Is that asks the question is sort of the operations guy, the guy that runs, although he keeps the books, he keeps stuff and um, it's just easier for him probably in their minds that I don't think they realize the set.

Like when they sell the business, they're like, oh, we'll just add you to the payroll. You'll be the new president. But it is easy peasy. There's enough, you know, money there and this or that. And yeah, we'll have to make, you'll have to make adjustments to salaries and things. But I think they've realized, you know, sort of the broader picture or at least and, and because he, he is representing his father.

Uh, 'cause his father's 90 years old. Who, who owns it? So he's, he's just another, well, not just, but he is another employee. Yeah. But he is acting as a, so I think it has to do more with practices. Really 

[00:42:40]
Athena: strong tactic though. 'cause they're gonna ask you for a lot of things and if we [00:43:00] make assumptions on why they're asking it, then we kind of lose the opportunity to overcome the objection and redirect and ask more questions.

So, um, like objection handling is something that like, I wish I would've learned much earlier in my career. 'cause I was always like, I'm not sales. I'm not sales. And somebody like, you know, ask for something or da da da. And, and like, if you're answering the questions and you're no longer in the position of power, right?

So when they ask for that being like, and they're gonna like, okay, but can we have work inventory separate? Okay. Um, totally understand. Like you're concerned about that. Can you tell me what's important to you about that? And then they'll be like, da, da da, da. Okay, so let me just get this straight. You want a stock sale because you think it would be easier to put me on payroll.

Um, are you aware that like any previous slide, you know, so like you can then start asking questions that, that get [00:44:00] your points across, but ask them the questions to kind of understand their understanding of it. Because honestly this like stock sale, asset sale, the tax situation can break a deal so many times.

So you wanna kind of get an understanding of like a, is there someone now advising then that you're not aware of that can become a deal breaker down the line? Um. Do they, are they concerned about taxes? Are they concerned about operations? Where are the concerns actually coming from so that you can ask more questions and understand that if it's not this point, it's a bunch of other points.

And then you can redirect the answer or ask more questions to kind of get them to see why it would be to their benefit. And they're like, oh, I'm really concerned about taxes. It's like, well, um, with a asset sale, um, I've actually offered you more money. And the way we've structured it. Um, you know, are you familiar with [00:45:00] like capital gains tax and how that works and how you're gonna be paying it with a seller note versus, so you can ask 'em some questions about how you've structured it to see if they understand that.

Um, what I will also say is like the lawyer thing, Chris, I wouldn't glaze over that. I'd be asking them and be like, Hey, do you want me to have the AcquiMatch team get in touch with you and make some introductions? Because I know you've got a family lawyer that you really trust, but if they haven't been down the road of SBA small business.

Transactions, it can end up like holding you back significantly because there's certain ways that this thing needs to happen in order for the SBA to do the financing options. It's better if you work with somebody that like has done a bunch of these transactions and you can be protected with somebody that really knows what they're doing.

Um, and I know the team can make, so then it's not, it's not feeling weird by you making the introductions, you could be like, do you want me to have the team get in touch with you and make some introductions for you? Like, I can promise you, like your family attorney is [00:46:00] probably amazing, but if they haven't done a lot of small business SBA transactions, I've just heard of horror stories of owners that end up like losing opportunities and losing these sales because the family attorney just wasn't equipped with, with how these things needed to be drafted and written in order to be compliant with SBA financing, um, or putting you at a disadvantage because they don't have enough experience in these kinds of transactions.

So, um. I always make the offer and I'm, I'm seeing that for everybody on the call, like the, the person that is the seller's lawyer. You really wanna have somebody that knows their stuff in this regard on the other side of it and knows what's reasonable and knows what's common in small business land. So a lot of times people just get their family attorney, um, you know, that like has never done these transactions before, that does like, will just rip up all the things that are normal in the transactions.

And I hear of deals breaking all the time because the seller's [00:47:00] attorney was not experienced. So, super important to try to like also guide them, coach them to like, make sure that they're protected and represented well. And this got a lot of, obviously we always love Barlow Williams for y'all, but, um, we've got a lot of really great, like other attorneys that, that work on the other side of Barlow Williams really well.

They can recommend people, but sometimes like saying like, Hey, you know, do you want the team to get back in touch with you and make some recommendations? Then it feels like they're also getting support. That's not necessarily like you're recommending someone that might not be in their best interest. Um, but I would say like, get that, you almost want them to have someone kind of now, right, or start thinking about who that person's gonna be be, um, since there's no broker in the mix.

Uh, another thing that you mentioned, so the building with a lawsuit, are each of the buildings in a different entity or is it [00:48:00] all owned by one? 

[00:48:03]
Chris: It is one entity separate to the business that has a portfolio. I don't, I think it's a holding company, uh, based on an I need to re-ask. And I figured this would come later, but I wanna say from an offhand comment that we did, it is a holding company separate from the business, um, that also has like sub LLCs.

That's what I understood, but I wanna validate that 'cause they always re refer to the holding company. Um, so that, I would need to verify that. 

[00:48:28]
Athena: Yeah, that might, are you gonna come to Thursday’s Buyers Club with Wendy? That might be a good question. 'cause I, I do know for sure like no transaction can be done with SBA if the business entity's involved in any outstanding legal situations.

I don't know how that works for the real estate side of things. Um, so that would be a good question specific to you to ask like, Hey, what questions should I be asking at this [00:49:00] point about this situation to make sure that, that it can go through SBA or what things could be a deal breaker in regard to the real estate aspect?

[00:49:10]
Chris: Um, yeah. Well, and that, and that situation was, I guess ultimately it's not against them, it's them maybe pursuing it, which is still a legal matter, but, um, but it was very educational. 'cause it also gave me a sense of like, oh, they've had to spend x amount in one-offs to, based on this error that, that a contractor did in the roof.

Right. I am like, that's not nothing. It wasn't, it wasn't a huge amount. But it adds up, right? If you have to do it every two to three years, that's 15, 20 K here, 15, 20 k there, that was not accounted for maybe in, in the, you know, the CapEx or, or, or, or either way. And the different, um, expenses that we need to somehow, I wanna keep low, right?

I don't wanna, so either way. So that, that might be interesting. Um, I will ask that question. So [00:50:00] point taken. I will need to also come, uh, pull some people at my network that do this and sort of see how my rationale by just getting two buildings was reducing the amount of costs and fees that I have to pay when you have more smaller properties.

'cause then you have to get, the appraisal is one thing, but you have to then, you know, environmental studies and all these other things that you wanna make sure so it, that'll add up quickly. So two sounded way cleaner than. I don't know, maybe four. Yeah. Which looking like, so, 

[00:50:25]
Athena: so another thing if they're putting solar panels in, something that you might wanna explore is the, uh, 504 Green, which is different from, so like I know you, you modeled it all out as like putting the business into this 7(a) and getting the 25 year am.

But it might also be interesting to see what, if anything, you could get through the 504 Green, which is basically you committing to make [00:51:00] some green initiatives into the building that you're buying. If they're already installing solar and that sort of thing, might be just an interesting avenue. I'll be completely honest, I haven't been involved in any 504 Green specifics, but I've heard the play could be really advantageous in terms of terms and things that you can get for the real estate. So if they're already incorporating panels or there's other things that you could do to make these facilities green, then you might be able to access better terms on the 504 Green. 

[00:51:35]
Chris: Good to know. I didn't, yeah, I didn't think of that. I, yeah, I just know they, I saw 'em on Google Maps. They have the roofs full of solar panels. Yeah. 

[00:51:45]
Athena: Great. Um, cool. Well, exciting stuff. So, sounds like next steps are, they're gonna sit with the LOI, uh, give you some feedback y'all are gonna revisit on Monday.

In the meantime, you can do a little homework, come to the call on Thursday, ask some questions in terms of like this particular [00:52:00] situation. Um, and then also I, I might reach out and just be like, Hey, I can ask the team to, to make an introduction to some lawyers that have experience in these types of transactions if you'd like, you know?

Mm-hmm. 'cause it can be like, oh, great, they don't have a lawyer involved. But I can tell you what, when that family lawyer comes in at the 11th hour, it's gonna be an absolute nightmare for you. Yeah, yeah. Better to, better to get them with someone like good upfront, and Yeah. You know, you'll have someone adept at these things on the other end of the transaction, but they'll work well with the lawyer and like, you know, make sure that everything's fair and on the up and up, and that they understand because they don't have an advisor on their side right now too.

[00:52:35]
David: No, that, that makes sense. It's more 

[00:52:38]
Athena: of a, like, I've seen the family lawyer come in on the off market and they realize there's no broker in the mix, and then they feel like they need to protect their client and they're trying to blow up the [00:53:00] deal and it's fucking nightmare, so. 

[00:53:05]
Chris: Okay. No, no, good.

That's a very good point. I will, I'll definitely reach out. 

[00:53:12]
Athena: Yeah. Great. Cool. This is exciting. Some good stuff in the works. Um, well, any other questions? Are you feeling good about next steps there? 

[00:53:22]
Chris: No, I'm feeling good. I, I, I feel they'll come back with, I, I'm less worried about price or anything. I feel they might come back with questions and things.

I, yeah, I'm just hopeful and, uh, I don't know. I feel like it might not be on Monday, but over the next two weeks that we can get something signed and then start the process, so, so we'll see. 

[00:53:45]
Athena: Yeah, and you know, they know that you're. Doing this for the first time too. So it's totally okay if they come back with questions to be like, Hey, let me look into that and come back to you.

Right? Like, they trust you. And that's the most important thing at this point, is that you guys have a very collaborative and trusting [00:54:00] relationship. Um, what we can do in our call, uh, tomorrow too, is we can start just advantageously modeling out what a stock sale might look like or if inventory doesn't go in your favor.

So we can just see what the swings or what the adjustments might look like. Mm-hmm. Um, or if we were to do 504. So, uh, if that sounds like a good use of our time, we can just do some scenarios and see, okay, well if they say this, you know, sometimes I feel like. It's better for me if I've modeled it out and I know like where my edges are financially, if they come back and say like, inventory or, um, what does 504 Green look like?

Or even 504 if we were to pull this out, or what if they want a stock sale? How does that affect my cash flow? Um, or if they come back on the, the seller note, you know, 50% is pretty substantial so we can play around with some things so you can kind of know where your edges are. Okay. Cool. Exciting stuff.

Well, uh, [00:55:00] it looks like we are at time. Um, I'm gonna see many of you tomorrow, so if we didn't get a chance to go through your stuff today, then um, we'll do that tomorrow. And then, uh, just a reminder that on Thursday, Wendy from Live Oak's gonna be here. I know all of you know her, but what I really wanted to get her to pull out, 'cause we we're hearing a lot about the SOP guidelines and the process from like, you know, the buyer's perspective, but I want you to hear the lender's perspective, like what goes on behind the scenes, what are the conversations about, what are the frustrations from their end?

What are the things that like, break a deal when it gets to credit? Like what does that process actually look like from their side so that you all understand what the lender's going through when we bring something to them and then they have to go through the process of getting it over the line because there's multiple people, multiple stakeholders. Oftentimes they're going to that and they're arguing in your defense, you know, they're having a lot of conversations, which are about you [00:56:00] specifically and not even the deal. So what do those conversations look like so that you can be better prepared when it comes time to go through this process, which a couple of you're getting close to, um, or, you know, going through again for some of you.

So that'll be really fun. And she's like, you know, no questions off the table. So if you all have any questions or even questions about your specific deals that you're hovering right now, feel free to bring those. As you know, uh, I usually have a whole bunch of questions prepared, so there's not data, but I want you all to feel like you can ask your questions too.

So this will be a really good one, uh, with a friendly lender who's super supportive of all of you and really excited, um, about supporting you through your deals.

So great to see you, Peter. It was wonderful to have you at the first Buyers Club. Thanks for joining us and, um, great to hear how everybody's progressing on the deals. We'll see you on Thursday with Wendy, and I'll see a whole bunch of you tomorrow too.

Have a great rest of your day. Take care everyone. Bye.
