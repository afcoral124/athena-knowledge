[Error #1 - Category: Financial/Numerical Error]
Location: ~[00:07:45] / Speaker: Ryan
Transcript excerpt: "he now wanted 30M dollars instead of 2."
Issue: 30M is inconsistent with the rest of the discussion (all figures are 2–3 million).
Likely intended: "3M dollars instead of 2" or "2 to 3 million"
Confidence: High
Reasoning: All subsequent references discuss 2.5–3.0M; 30M would be implausible given size (6 FTEs, small fleet) and the valuation context.
Impact: High

---
[Error #2 - Category: Omission/Truncation]
Location: ~[00:07:55] / Speaker: Ryan
Transcript excerpt: "hey, you did tell me to 3M is a pretty big push there."
Issue: Garbled phrase; missing words around “2 to 3M.”
Likely intended: "you did tell me 2; 3M is a pretty big push" or "you did tell me 2; 2 to 3M is a big push"
Confidence: Medium
Reasoning: Follows directly from the prior price shift; syntax is broken in a way typical of ASR truncation.
Impact: Medium

---
[Error #3 - Category: Misheard Acronym]
Location: ~[00:09:05] / Speaker: Joe
Transcript excerpt: "we only have numbers based on three years of PNLs."
Issue: "PNLs" should be "P&Ls" (Profit and Loss statements).
Likely intended: "P&Ls"
Confidence: High
Reasoning: Standard finance acronym; “PNL” is a frequent ASR substitution.
Impact: Medium

---
[Error #4 - Category: Business Terminology Distortion]
Location: ~[00:13:05] / Speaker: Joe
Transcript excerpt: "again, 5 percent of the asking price it's given me..."
Issue: Preceded by "seller. No," suggesting truncation.
Likely intended: "seller note" (not “seller no”)
Confidence: High
Reasoning: Context is financing terms and seller note percentage; the clipped “No” is prototypical ASR cut-off.
Impact: Medium

---
[Error #5 - Category: Misheard Term (Industry/Technical)]
Location: ~[00:23:05] / Speaker: Joe
Transcript excerpt: "putting a 3 on in or whatever it is to service your AC unit."
Issue: "3 on" is nonsensical in HVAC context.
Likely intended: "Freon" (colloquial for refrigerant) or "R-410A"
Confidence: High
Reasoning: HVAC servicing often references refrigerant; phonetic similarity to "Freon."
Impact: Medium

---
[Error #6 - Category: Misheard Acronym/Term]
Location: ~[00:38:15] / Speaker: Athena
Transcript excerpt: "they use the U. S. System and implemented, and so the business just started taking off."
Issue: "U.S. System" is likely misheard for EOS (Entrepreneurial Operating System).
Likely intended: "EOS system"
Confidence: High
Reasoning: EOS is widely used in SMB; “U.S.” vs “E-O-S” is a common ASR confusion.
Impact: Medium

---
[Error #7 - Category: Homophone/Near-homophone]
Location: ~[00:50:35] / Speaker: Athena
Transcript excerpt: "which, in this case might be proofing, you know, like, I just want to go out to jobs..."
Issue: "proofing" is wrong for the discussed industry.
Likely intended: "roofing"
Confidence: High
Reasoning: The business discussed is a roofing company; “proofing” is contextually incorrect.
Impact: Medium

---
[Error #8 - Category: Entity Name (Speaker Name Inconsistency)]
Location: Multiple (e.g., ~[00:03:55], ~[00:10:10]) / Speakers: “Anke” vs “Anca”
Transcript excerpt: "Anka will be able to explain..." and later speaker tag "**Anke:**"
Issue: Speaker’s name appears as “Anka/Anke,” while others refer to “Anca.”
Likely intended: “Anca”
Confidence: High
Reasoning: Repeated references by Athena to “Anca”; inconsistent spellings point to ASR variance.
Impact: Low

---
[Error #9 - Category: Speaker Misattribution]
Location: ~[00:00:55-00:01:05]
Transcript excerpt:
  Gil: "...never actually met Luke personally."
  Chris: "Thank you. Great to meet you. I know you've been watching my videos probably."
Issue: The response likely came from Luke (not Chris), based on context about “my videos.”
Likely intended: Speaker should be “Luke”
Confidence: Medium
Reasoning: The person being “met” after Luke is named logically would be Luke; Luke is known for videos in this community.
Impact: Medium

---
[Error #10 - Category: Misheard Acronym]
Location: ~[00:37:15] and ~[00:57:40] / Speaker: Athena
Transcript excerpt: "before you order a QV..." and later "...she's going to talk about Rob's..."
Issue: "QV" likely "QoE" (Quality of Earnings); "Rob's" should be "ROBS" (Rollovers as Business Startups).
Likely intended: "QoE"; "ROBS"
Confidence: High
Reasoning: Both are standard M&A/financing acronyms; ASR often mis-cases or mishears them.
Impact: Medium

---
[Error #11 - Category: Semantic Inconsistency]
Location: ~[00:02:35-00:03:20] / Speaker: Athena
Transcript excerpt: "we've got a DBA, so we had to file with the entity. the government here in Texas..."
Issue: "file with the entity, the government" is awkward and likely misheard.
Likely intended: "file with the state (Texas Secretary of State)" or similar
Confidence: Medium
Reasoning: You file a DBA with the state, not “with the entity”; wording suggests ASR confusion.
Impact: Low

---
[Error #12 - Category: Semantic/Omission]
Location: ~[00:46:15] / Speaker: Athena
Transcript excerpt: "be okay with the half face still there."
Issue: Phrase is nonsensical.
Likely intended: "have his face still there" (i.e., former owner remaining visible)
Confidence: Medium
Reasoning: Context is owner staying involved; “half face” is illogical, likely “have his face.”
Impact: Low

---
[Error #13 - Category: Consistency (Brand/Proper Noun)]
Location: Multiple (e.g., ~[00:02:05], ~[00:03:40])
Transcript excerpt: "AcuMatch update..."; "Acquimatch..."; "Acquimatch..."
Issue: Inconsistent spelling/capitalization of brand name.
Likely intended: "AcquiMatch"
Confidence: Medium
Reasoning: Company appears as “AcquiMatch” in materials; ASR often varies casing/spelling.
Impact: Low

---
[Error #14 - Category: Minor Temporal/Grammar]
Location: ~[00:20:45] / Speaker: Athena
Transcript excerpt: "your 3 year 3 is typically when you start bouncing back"
Issue: Word order likely wrong.
Likely intended: "by year 3" or "your year 3"
Confidence: Medium
Reasoning: Standard phrasing in financial ramp/J-curve discussions.
Impact: Low

---

[REMOVAL #1 - Type: Small Talk (Weather/Greetings)]
Location: ~[00:00:00-00:00:35]
Speakers involved: Athena, Gil
Content excerpt:
"Athena: Hey, how's it going? Wonderful
Gil: yourself.
Athena: So good.
Gil: Really
Athena: good. It's it's very cold here, but
Gil: it's it's it's cold here too.
Athena: Up in New York."
Reasoning:
Pure pleasantries and weather chat without business relevance.
Context impact: None—business agenda begins immediately after.
Recommended action: REMOVE ~[00:00:00-00:00:35]

---
[REMOVAL #2 - Type: Small Talk]
Location: ~[00:01:35-00:01:45]
Speakers involved: Athena, Chris
Content excerpt:
"Athena: Hey, Chris. Happy New Year
Chris: everyone happy New Year.
Athena: Happy New Year."
Reasoning:
Seasonal greetings only; no business content.
Context impact: None—conversation proceeds to updates and deal discussion.
Recommended action: REMOVE ~[00:01:35-00:01:45]

---

[BORDERLINE #1 - Requires Review]
Location: ~[00:02:05-00:05:10]
Content excerpt: "AcuMatch update... DBA... file in Texas... Slack URL change; may log you out; reach out to Anca..."
Business relevance argument: Operationally important for participants (branding, email continuity, Slack access for ongoing collaboration).
Personal content argument: Administrative detail not directly related to M&A/deal analysis.
Recommendation: KEEP—Helps maintain continuity/access for clients; low risk to flow.

---
[BORDERLINE #2 - Requires Review]
Location: ~[00:57:30-00:59:55]
Content excerpt: "Thursday we've got Susie on ROBS... next week SMB acquirer Mike... following Thursday insurance due diligence..."
Business relevance argument: Educational content announcements (ROBS financing, diligence) are directly relevant to buyers’ process.
Personal content argument: Scheduling/admin announcements could be trimmed for a tighter, deal-focused transcript.
Recommendation: KEEP—Provides actionable resources and learning opportunities; not personal chatter.

---

Additional notes/patterns for ASR improvement:
- Frequent confusion on acronyms: P&L → PNL; QoE → QV; ROBS → Rob's; EOS → U.S. System.
- Proper nouns: “Anca” rendered as “Anke/Anka”; “AcquiMatch” inconsistent spelling/casing.
- HVAC/roofing terms: “Freon” → “3 on”; “roofing” → “proofing.”
- Large numeric values: “30M” misheard when context is low millions; recommend numeric consistency checks against prior context.

Speaker attribution validation:
- Potential misattribution at ~[00:01:00] where “Chris” likely should be “Luke” given the “my videos” remark. Suggest reviewer confirm against attendee list/voices.

Context preservation check:
- Removing small talk segments at start and New Year greetings will not impact understanding; flow resumes with updates and deal analysis.
