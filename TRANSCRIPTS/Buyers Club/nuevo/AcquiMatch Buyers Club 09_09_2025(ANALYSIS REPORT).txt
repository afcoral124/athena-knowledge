[Error #1 - Category: Business terminology distortion]
Location: ~00:01:20 / Speaker: Athena
Transcript excerpt: "on deck for today 'cause we're docking deal reviews Today I'm gonna be..."
Issue: “docking deal reviews” is semantically off in this context.
Likely intended: “doing deal reviews today”
Confidence: High
Reasoning: “Doing deal reviews” is a standard phrase for this meeting type; “docking” has no clear meaning here.
Impact: Low-Medium

[Error #2 - Category: Misheard Acronym]
Location: ~00:16:05 / Speaker: Justin
Transcript excerpt: "I solicit a QFP, I put money down for these things..."
Issue: “QFP” in diligence context is atypical.
Likely intended: “QoE (Quality of Earnings)”
Confidence: High
Reasoning: In M&A, buyers “solicit a QoE,” not “QFP.” Matches prior references to “quality of earnings.”
Impact: Medium-High (affects understanding of diligence steps)

---
[Error #3 - Category: Misheard Acronym]
Location: ~00:21:05 / Speaker: Justin
Transcript excerpt: "...feasible, like with respect to DCR R and all of that."
Issue: “DCR R” is not standard.
Likely intended: “DSCR (Debt Service Coverage Ratio)”
Confidence: High
Reasoning: DSCR is the common financing metric discussed for SBA/leveraged deals.
Impact: High (key financing metric)

---
[Error #4 - Category: Misheard Acronym/Term]
Location: ~00:23:10 / Speaker: Justin
Transcript excerpt: "they wanted that in the LI and I. So I did write that in."
Issue: “LI and I” is not a standard deal document.
Likely intended: “LOI (Letter of Intent)”
Confidence: High
Reasoning: Context involves terms included in an LOI.
Impact: Medium

---
[Error #5 - Category: Entity names (inconsistency)]
Location: ~00:24:40 / Speaker: Justin; and ~01:07:30 / Speaker: Athena
Transcript excerpt: 
- Justin: "I used the, the Barlow Williams, uh, example..."
- Athena: "What Barley Williams do is they're like, will your grandmother understand it?"
Issue: Two different forms (“Barlow Williams” vs “Barley Williams”) likely refer to the same firm.
Likely intended: A single consistent firm name (e.g., “Barlow Williams” or similar)
Confidence: Medium
Reasoning: Close phonetic variants in the same discussion suggest ASR inconsistency on the firm name.
Impact: Medium (can cause confusion on references/templates)

---
[Error #6 - Category: Entity name + speaker/pronoun inconsistency]
Location: ~00:18:00 / Speaker: Justin
Transcript excerpt: "...the broker texted me, he is like... you could see Claudia, the broker..."
Issue: Broker repeatedly referred to as “he,” but name given as “Claudia” (commonly female). Could be “Claudio” or a different name.
Likely intended: “Claudio” (male) or consistent pronouns for “Claudia”
Confidence: Medium
Reasoning: Pronoun/name mismatch likely due to ASR on a proper noun.
Impact: Low-Medium

---
[Error #7 - Category: Semantic inconsistency]
Location: ~00:33:00 / Speaker: Michael
Transcript excerpt: "he's on vacation, like head of the Switzerland."
Issue: Ungrammatical phrase.
Likely intended: “headed to Switzerland”
Confidence: High
Reasoning: Common phrasing in travel context; current wording sounds like ASR glitch.
Impact: Low

---
[Error #8 - Category: Homophone/near-homophone]
Location: ~00:33:40 and ~00:34:10 / Speaker: Michael
Transcript excerpt: "the cash are closed is typically coming from that, from that lender"
Issue: “cash are closed” is incorrect phrase.
Likely intended: “cash at close”
Confidence: High
Reasoning: “Cash at close” is the standard term in offers.
Impact: Medium

---
[Error #9 - Category: Business terminology distortion]
Location: ~00:49:10 / Speaker: Athena
Transcript excerpt: "we always work off the assumption that networking capital is gonna be included."
Issue: “networking capital” misstates the financial term.
Likely intended: “net working capital”
Confidence: High
Reasoning: Standard M&A concept; misstatement could confuse financial modeling points.
Impact: Medium

---
[Error #10 - Category: Semantic inconsistency]
Location: ~00:57:35-00:58:10 / Speaker: Athena
Transcript excerpt: "we will do typically eight years after that. So it's over the life of the loan again. So over the 10 years"
Issue: Amortization period alternates between 8 and 10 years in the same explanation.
Likely intended: A single clear period (commonly 10 years to match SBA loan term), or 8 years if that’s an internal assumption—needs clarification.
Confidence: Medium
Reasoning: Conflicting figures in sequence likely an ASR or speaker slip.
Impact: Medium

---
[Error #11 - Category: Word error]
Location: ~01:07:30 / Speaker: Athena
Transcript excerpt: "The LOI, the only part that is actually legally blind binding is the exclusivity..."
Issue: “legally blind binding” is incorrect.
Likely intended: “legally binding”
Confidence: High
Reasoning: Common legal phrasing around LOI enforceability.
Impact: Low

---
[Error #12 - Category: Potential factual inaccuracy]
Location: ~00:04:30 / Speaker: Athena
Transcript excerpt: "Relay banking... you can set up, I think up to like 30 different accounts..."
Issue: Relay has historically advertised a different cap (often 20), though features can change.
Likely intended: A specific max number of sub-accounts (confirm current product limits)
Confidence: Low-Medium
Reasoning: Product limits vary; suggest verification.
Impact: Low

---
[Error #13 - Category: Misheard term]
Location: ~00:39:45 / Speaker: Lisa
Transcript excerpt: "What is a vibe coder? This is a phrase, I don't know."
Issue: “vibe coder” likely mishears the earlier “low-code/no-code” discussion.
Likely intended: “no-code (or low-code)”
Confidence: High
Reasoning: Conversation context is software for low-code/no-code users.
Impact: Low

---
[Error #14 - Category: Omission/Truncation]
Location: ~00:28:45 / Speaker: Athena (and unclear speaker)
Transcript excerpt: "Dunno if that got through to him. 'cause it was a little broken up. Yeah."
Issue: Fragmented utterance and stray “Yeah.” suggest audio drop or misattribution.
Likely intended: Acknowledgment of poor connection without the stray interjection.
Confidence: Medium
Reasoning: Preceded by known connection issues with Federico.
Impact: Low

Location: ~00:01:20-00:06:20
Content excerpt:

Business relevance argument: Educational for buyers/owners on personal and business cash management, taxes, and profit allocation—useful operational context for acquirers.

Speaker Attribution Validation Notes
- Potential name/pronoun mismatch for the broker (“Claudia” vs repeated “he”), suggesting an entity name ASR error (likely “Claudio”). Flagged above (Error #6).
- One stray interjection “Yeah.” during a reported audio issue, likely misattributed (Error #14).

Cross-Reference/Consistency Notes
- QoE referenced multiple times but once misheard as “QFP” (Error #2).
- DSCR referenced once as “DCR R” (Error #3).
- Law firm name appears as two variants (Error #5).
- LOI referred to incorrectly as “LI and I” once (Error #4).
- Net working capital repeatedly discussed; one “networking capital” misstatement (Error #9).

Patterns to Flag for ASR Improvement
- Acronyms in M&A contexts (QoE, DSCR, LOI) frequently misrecognized.
- Proper nouns (person names, firm names) inconsistently rendered.
- Homophones around “cash at close” and “net working capital.”
- Occasional truncations with remote participants (car/connection issues).
