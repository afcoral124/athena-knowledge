ASR Error Reports

[Error #1 - Category: Business terminology distortion]
Location: Line 4 / Speaker: Athena
Transcript excerpt: "Gil, let's start with you. You've got assigned LOI tell us about."
Issue: "assigned LOI" in context should be "a signed LOI"
Likely intended: "You've got a signed LOI; tell us about it."
Confidence: High
Reasoning: In M&A, “signed LOI” is the standard phrase; “assigned LOI” is atypical and changes meaning.
Impact: High

[Error #2 - Category: Semantic inconsistency / Omission]
Location: Line 5 / Speaker: Gil
Transcript excerpt: "I did and I got line, um, got it on Sunday morning."
Issue: “got line” is nonsensical; likely dropped/garbled word
Likely intended: "I did, and I got mine" or "I did, and I got the LOI"
Confidence: Medium
Reasoning: Fits context of discussing a signed LOI received Sunday.
Impact: Medium

[Error #3 - Category: Business terminology distortion (word substitution)]
Location: Line 5 / Speaker: Gil
Transcript excerpt: "talking to them, uh, through our commissions from you"
Issue: “commissions” doesn’t fit; context is introductions/referrals
Likely intended: "through your recommendations" or "through your connections"
Confidence: High
Reasoning: Broker and advisor recommendations/connections are standard; “commissions” is incongruent here.
Impact: Medium

[Error #4 - Category: Financial/numerical error]
Location: Line 7 / Speaker: Gil
Transcript excerpt: "I need their up to date, 2 20 25 financials."
Issue: “2 20 25” is garbled date/period reference
Likely intended: "up-to-date 2025 financials (YTD)"
Confidence: Medium
Reasoning: Meeting occurs May 2025; lenders typically request current YTD financials.
Impact: High (affects due diligence requests)

[Error #5 - Category: Entity name distortion (company)]
Location: Line 11 / Speaker: Gil
Transcript excerpt: "link to a folder that's, uh, I think that is, uh, an atch folder."
Issue: “atch” mishears company name
Likely intended: "an AcquiMatch folder"
Confidence: High
Reasoning: Company hosting the call is AcquiMatch; “atch” likely truncation.
Impact: Medium

[Error #6 - Category: Entity name distortion (company)]
Location: Line 13 / Speaker: Anke
Transcript excerpt: "the drive to the acronym match folder is just a preview"
Issue: “acronym match” mishears AcquiMatch
Likely intended: "the link to the AcquiMatch folder is just a preview"
Confidence: High
Reasoning: Consistent with brand name; repeated mishearing pattern.
Impact: Medium

[Error #7 - Category: Entity name distortion (podcast)]
Location: Line 16 / Speaker: Gil
Transcript excerpt: "I saw, uh, Lindsay and Kevin yesterday on the, uh, yeah. On uh, coin Wines."
Issue: “coin Wines” mishears the podcast name
Likely intended: "Acquiring Minds"
Confidence: High
Reasoning: Later dialogue references the Acquiring Minds podcast explicitly.
Impact: Medium

[Error #8 - Category: Entity name distortion (podcast)]
Location: Line 17 / Speaker: Athena
Transcript excerpt: "also great to hear them on acquiring mine."
Issue: “acquiring mine” mishears “Acquiring Minds”
Likely intended: "Acquiring Minds"
Confidence: High
Reasoning: The podcast title is consistent across the conversation.
Impact: Medium

[Error #9 - Category: Business terminology distortion]
Location: Line 21 / Speaker: Athena
Transcript excerpt: "Brooke might also, you know, take control and be like..."
Issue: “Brooke” likely misheard for “broker”
Likely intended: "the broker might also..."
Confidence: High
Reasoning: Context refers to broker leading the meeting, not a person named Brooke.
Impact: Medium

[Error #10 - Category: Entity name error (person)]
Location: Line 35 / Speaker: Athena
Transcript excerpt: "And Paul, it's good to see you."
Issue: Speaker addressed as “Paul” but participant is “Polly”
Likely intended: "Polly"
Confidence: High
Reasoning: All other references are “Polly.”
Impact: Medium (identity confusion)

[Error #11 - Category: Business terminology distortion]
Location: Line 55 / Speaker: Athena
Transcript excerpt: "Tell me about the power sports."
Issue: Topic is “water sports” business, not power sports
Likely intended: "water sports"
Confidence: High
Reasoning: Previous and subsequent content consistently say “water sports.”
Impact: Medium

[Error #12 - Category: Business terminology distortion]
Location: Line 30 / Speaker: Gil
Transcript excerpt: "So the, the PM me is coming out and, uh, starting to, uh, put all..."
Issue: Missing preposition; awkward phrasing
Likely intended: "the PM in me is coming out"
Confidence: High
Reasoning: Common expression meaning “my project manager side.”
Impact: Low

[Error #13 - Category: Speaker misattribution/truncation]
Location: Lines 50-51 / Speakers: Anke and Athena
Transcript excerpt:
"Anke: Okay. We
Athena: offer a little bit over asking, but then it's forgiven based on revenue targets..."
Issue: Fragmented handoff; “Okay. We” is incomplete and continues in Athena’s turn
Likely intended: Entire sentence belongs to a single speaker or the fragment was dropped
Confidence: High
Reasoning: Incoherent split; content describes deal structuring without speaker change.
Impact: Medium

[Error #14 - Category: Semantic inconsistency]
Location: Line 28 / Speaker: Athena
Transcript excerpt: "he doesn't feel like he's out like level with us, you know?"
Issue: “out like level” is non-standard phrasing
Likely intended: "he’s not leveling with us" or "not being level with us"
Confidence: Medium
Reasoning: Fits the context of seller transparency.
Impact: Low

[Error #15 - Category: Business terminology distortion]
Location: Line 60 / Speaker: Polly
Transcript excerpt: "I marked this down as far as the taxes, the fees, the marketing capital."
Issue: “marketing capital” should be “working capital”
Likely intended: "working capital"
Confidence: High
Reasoning: Context is cash needs for seasonal business; working capital is the term.
Impact: High

[Error #16 - Category: Entity name inconsistency (person)]
Location: Lines 68-70 / Speakers: Athena, Polly
Transcript excerpt: "flying to South Africa on Thursday for Anika's wedding... we're so happy for you Anka."
Issue: “Anika” vs “Anka” inconsistency; also speaker label elsewhere is “Anke”
Likely intended: Consistent “Anke”
Confidence: Medium
Reasoning: The team member throughout is “Anke”; “Anika” likely misheard.
Impact: Low (but identity clarity)

[Error #17 - Category: Semantic inconsistency / Nonsense token]
Location: Line 74 / Speaker: Anke
Transcript excerpt: "Because comes you're gaining time and then when you fly back..."
Issue: “Because comes” is nonsensical
Likely intended: "Because you're gaining time"
Confidence: High
Reasoning: Standard timezone phrasing mis-transcribed.
Impact: Low

[Error #18 - Category: Business terminology distortion]
Location: Line 78 / Speaker: Athena
Transcript excerpt: "debt service coverage, written, none of that stuff"
Issue: “written” mishears key term
Likely intended: "debt service coverage ratio"
Confidence: High
Reasoning: DSCR is the standard term in financing discussions.
Impact: High

[Error #19 - Category: Business terminology formatting (minor)]
Location: Line 17 / Speaker: Athena
Transcript excerpt: "then you name it a 1.1 or whatever that line is"
Issue: The due diligence numbering convention likely “A1.1”
Likely intended: "A1.1"
Confidence: Medium
Reasoning: Common DD list numbering uses alpha-numeric sections.
Impact: Low


Segment Mapping (Keep / Remove / Mixed)

Block A: Opening and LOI update (Lines 1-7)
- KEEP
- Rationale: Core to deal status; lender outreach; customer concentration concern; meeting planning.

Block B: Due diligence process and initial lender-focused DD list (Lines 8-10)
- MIXED
- Notes:
  - KEEP: All instructions about tailoring the DD list for lenders, using a master list, SBA checkbox filtering, process explanation.
  - REMOVE: Allergy/weather aside.
- Precise removals:
  [REMOVAL #1 - Type: Small Talk]
  Location: Line 10
  Speakers involved: Anke, Athena
  Content excerpt:
  "Anke: Oh, bless you.
  Athena: Thanks. It's about to be a hundred degrees here, so allergy season is gonna start. There's just never ending allergy allergy season in Texas, actually."
  Reasoning: Weather/allergy small talk unrelated to business or deal process.
  Context impact: None—conversation immediately returns to DD process.
  Recommended action: REMOVE the above sentences only within Line 10.

Block C: DD folder linking and structure (Lines 11-13)
- KEEP
- Rationale: Operational process for due diligence file structure; important for deal execution. Note “AcquiMatch” misheard.

- KEEP (with speaker misattribution noted)
- Rationale: Creative structure (forgivable notes) tied to customer concentration risk.

Block I: Water sports business evaluation (Lines 55-61)

- Rationale: Seasonal operations, asset mix, owner seriousness, working capital, broker engagement, IOI strategy—core deal analysis.

- KEEP
- Rationale: Valuation of IP vs proven revenue—core acquisition decision logic.

- MIXED
- Notes:
  - KEEP (core admin): Announcement that next Thursday’s Buyers Club is canceled due to travel; brief scheduling continuity note.

  Location: Lines 72-75
  Speakers involved: Polly, Athena, Anke
  Content excerpt:
  "Polly: I do have one question. How long is the flight from Austin to South Africa?
  Athena: ... Austin to Atlanta ... overnight flight ... 12 or 14 hours, maybe longer. Do you remember Anka?
  Anke: It's long. I think it's in total like 19 hours or something. But you, it's a situation where you're, uh, gaining time. Because comes you're gaining time and then when you fly back, you're gonna lose some time again. What's the other way around? No, I don't know. Aina. It probably could be. I, I'm not sure.
  Athena: I'm losing, I'm losing time ... leave here ... land ... Bali ... pictures ... height difference ..."
  Reasoning: Extended travel/timezone/personal anecdotes unrelated to deals or client operations.
  Context impact: Low—does not affect any business guidance.
  Recommended action: REMOVE lines 72-75.

  [REMOVAL #3 - Type: Off-Topic/Small Talk]
  Location: Line 71
  Speakers involved: Athena
  Content excerpt:
  "yeah, I think that's it for today. Little, little lights. We get 20 minutes back unless there's any other questions..."
  Reasoning: Filler/admin chit-chat unrelated to deals.
  Context impact: None
  Recommended action: REMOVE line 71.

  [BORDERLINE #1 - Requires Review]
  Location: Lines 68-70
  Content excerpt: "…flying to South Africa… my flight time overlaps with the buyers club… so no Buyer’s Club on Thursday… we will be hosting Buyer’s Club next week at the normal times…"
  Business relevance argument: Provides scheduling info for members.
  Personal content argument: Wedding/travel reasons are personal.
  Recommendation: KEEP only the concise scheduling notice; REMOVE personal details about the wedding/travel.

- KEEP (brief professional closing)


Additional Borderline Segments

[BORDERLINE #2 - Requires Review]
Location: Line 14
Content excerpt: "Anka what I have you. Congratulations. I I saw your little notes in the thing. So good for you."
Business relevance argument: Maintaining rapport among team members; very brief.
Personal content argument: Not deal-related.
Recommendation: KEEP (low impact, brief; removing may not improve clarity meaningfully)

[BORDERLINE #3 - Requires Review]
Location: Lines 39-41
Content excerpt: Discussion about Polly’s daughter potentially getting involved with the digital agency and a new college graduate.
Business relevance argument: Staffing/participation considerations in a target business are relevant to buyer’s operating plan.
Personal content argument: Family mention.
Recommendation: KEEP (contextualizes buyer’s fit and operating model)

[BORDERLINE #4 - Requires Review]
Location: Line 31 (part: “He always wears a cowboy hat…”)
Business relevance argument: Identifies and characterizes a known ETA lender (recognition/context).
Personal content argument: Anecdotal.
Recommendation: KEEP (helps identify the lender in context; does not detract)


Speaker Attribution Validation and Consistency Flags
- Lines 50-51: Fragment “Anke: Okay. We” followed by Athena finishing the sentence indicates likely misattribution/truncation.
- Line 35: Addressing “Paul” instead of “Polly” is an identity error.
- Name consistency: “Anka” vs speaker label “Anke”; “Anika’s wedding” likely intended “Anke’s wedding.”


Cross-Reference/Pattern Notes
- Repeated mishearing of “AcquiMatch” as “atch” or “acronym match.”
- Repeated mishearing of “Acquiring Minds” as “coin Wines” and “acquiring mine.”
- Financial/terminology: DSCR misheard as “debt service coverage, written.”
- “Working capital” misheard as “marketing capital.”
- “Broker” misheard as proper name “Brooke.”


Summary of Recommended Removals
- REMOVAL #1: Allergy/weather aside (Line 10, brief)
- REMOVAL #2: Extended flight/timezone/long-trip/pictures/height discussion (Lines 72-75)
- REMOVAL #3: “20 minutes back” filler (Line 71)
- BORDERLINE #1: Trim wedding/travel reason; keep only scheduling notice (Lines 68-70)

All other content is business-relevant (LOI, lender coordination, due diligence list management, document naming conventions, seller meeting strategy, customer concentration risk and deal structuring, seasonal business considerations, IOI approach, valuation of IP without revenue, financial modeling/template enhancements).
