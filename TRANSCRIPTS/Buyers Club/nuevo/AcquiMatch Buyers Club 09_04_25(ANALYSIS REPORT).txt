ASR Error Reports

[Error #1 - Category: Misheard Acronym/Entity]
Location: ~00:01:00 / Speaker: Athena
Transcript excerpt: "I was just at S and Bash, so if we have some time, I was gonna share some insights..."
Issue: “S and Bash” appears to be a misheard event name.
Likely intended: "SMBash" (small business/SMB conference)
Confidence: High
Reasoning: In the SMB/M&A community, “SMBash” is a known conference; “S and Bash” is not.
Impact: Medium – references an industry event.

[Error #2 - Category: Business Terminology Distortion]
Location: ~00:03:40 / Speaker: Andrew
Transcript excerpt: "…I'd rather you have an iron in the fire… and have some degree of performance based or nos."
Issue: “nos” in this context is unclear.
Likely intended: "earnouts"
Confidence: Medium
Reasoning: Discussing options beyond a clean cash payout and aligned with later “performance-based” structures; “earnout” fits.
Impact: Medium – affects deal-structure understanding.

[Error #3 - Category: Homophone/Near-homophone]
Location: ~00:04:10 / Speaker: Andrew
Transcript excerpt: "…I was, you know, 45% and he did not bulk at that."
Issue: “bulk” used where “balk” fits the meaning.
Likely intended: "balk"
Confidence: High
Reasoning: Idiomatic usage for not objecting is “did not balk.”
Impact: Low-Medium – minor but noticeable.

[Error #4 - Category: Misheard Phrase / Semantic Inconsistency]
Location: ~00:06:05 / Speaker: Andrew
Transcript excerpt: "…this is gonna totally wipe out my family at Bico South. Full stop."
Issue: “Bico South” does not fit context.
Likely intended: "…wipe out my family if it goes south."
Confidence: High
Reasoning: Common phrase “if it goes south” suits risk context; “Bico South” is nonsensical here.
Impact: Medium – clarifies key risk statement.

[Error #5 - Category: Business Terminology Distortion]
Location: ~00:11:00 / Speaker: Athena
Transcript excerpt: "…effectively, like an earnout, which we're calling a forgivable performance space note…"
Issue: “performance space note” is not a known term.
Likely intended: "forgivable performance-based note"
Confidence: High
Reasoning: Later discussion consistently references performance-based notes; “space” is an ASR artifact.
Impact: Medium – terminology clarity.

[Error #6 - Category: Omission/Truncation]
Location: ~00:11:30-00:12:10 / Speaker: Andrew
Transcript excerpt: "…he asked about SBA asked and I…"
Issue: Repetition and truncation obscure meaning.
Likely intended: "He asked about SBA, and I…"
Confidence: Medium
Reasoning: Redundant “asked” likely an ASR duplication.
Impact: Low

[Error #7 - Category: Entity Names (Inconsistency)]
Location: ~00:15:30–00:18:20 / Speakers: Andrew, Athena
Transcript excerpt: 
- Andrew: "Williams and Barlow."
- Athena: "Barlow Williams"
Issue: Inconsistent naming of the law firm.
Likely intended: A single consistent firm name (verify exact order)
Confidence: Medium
Reasoning: Both refer to same firm; inconsistent order can cause confusion and verification issues.
Impact: Low

[Error #8 - Category: Omission/Truncation]
Location: ~00:17:40–00:18:05 / Speaker: Athena
Transcript excerpt: "…Do you do deals

Canadian immediately? We have a lot of great people…"
Issue: Broken and unclear sentence with mid-line break.
Likely intended: "Do you do Canadian deals?" or "If you don’t do Canadian deals, immediately…"
Confidence: Medium
Reasoning: Discussing whether the firm can handle Canadian transactions; sentence appears clipped.
Impact: Medium – affects action item clarity.

[Error #9 - Category: Business Terminology Distortion/Pattern]
Location: ~00:12:30–00:15:00 / Speakers: Andrew, Athena
Transcript excerpt: "…not perform well, you know, way less performer space or not performance based at all."
Issue: Repeated distortions of “performance-based” (e.g., “performer space”).
Likely intended: “performance-based” (note/structure)
Confidence: High
Reasoning: Multiple occurrences indicate ASR confusion pattern on “performance-based.”
Impact: Medium – structural clarity in deal terms.

[Error #10 - Category: Business Terminology Distortion]
Location: ~00:28:30–00:29:15 / Speaker: Justin
Transcript excerpt: "…I was asking about like, what is this aback like, you know, trying to reconcile some of the p and l…"
Issue: “aback” in financial context is likely wrong.
Likely intended: "add-back"
Confidence: High
Reasoning: In diligence, “add-backs” are standard in EBITDA normalization; “aback” is not.
Impact: High – add-backs materially affect valuation and financing.

[Error #11 - Category: Omission/Spacing]
Location: ~00:39:10 / Speaker: Justin
Transcript excerpt: "…they had this under LOII think before…"
Issue: Missing space/word boundary.
Likely intended: "LOI, I think"
Confidence: High
Reasoning: Spoken phrasing would be “LOI, I think”; written appears merged.
Impact: Low

[Error #12 - Category: Omission/Semantic]
Location: ~00:40:40–00:41:10 / Speaker: Justin
Transcript excerpt: "He was an engineer who was I colder and more technically minded…"
Issue: “who was I colder” is not grammatical.
Likely intended: "who was a bit colder" or "who was colder"
Confidence: Medium
Reasoning: Describing personality fit; likely a filler that ASR mangled.
Impact: Low

[Error #13 - Category: Omission/Truncation]
Location: ~00:46:20–00:46:45 / Speaker: Justin
Transcript excerpt: "…and my rebuttal was, did you. Your buyer, like, did you look into him?"
Issue: Cut-off after “did you.”
Likely intended: "Did you vet your buyer…?"
Confidence: High
Reasoning: Context is about diligence on buyer qualification.
Impact: Medium

[Error #14 - Category: Entity Names (Misnaming)]
Location: ~00:54:40–00:55:00 / Speaker: Athena
Transcript excerpt: "…Ryan is on vacation… we’re all still here for you with Brian being away."
Issue: “Ryan” vs “Brian” inconsistency.
Likely intended: “Ryan” in both instances.
Confidence: High
Reasoning: Earlier references are consistently “Ryan”; “Brian” likely ASR misname.
Impact: Medium – avoids confusion about staff availability.

[Error #15 - Category: Entity Name (Team Member) Inconsistency]
Location: ~00:12:50 and ~00:18:40 / Speakers: Andrew, Athena
Transcript excerpt:
- Andrew: "I told Anka too, Athena…"
- Athena: "Onca, I’m looking at you…"
Issue: “Anka” vs “Onca” inconsistency.
Likely intended: One specific person’s name (e.g., "Anca").
Confidence: Medium
Reasoning: Same role referenced with two spellings; needs verification.
Impact: Low


Segments to Remove

[REMOVAL #1 - Type: Personal Anecdote/Off-Topic]
Location: ~00:35:00–00:36:10
Speakers involved: Athena
Content excerpt:
"Athena: Do you remember, um, or have you been past Jurassic car wash on South Congress with all the animatronic dinosaurs?... I was trying to buy that business actually... He found two young girls like washing... in the dog wash... This is not the social media you're thinking of. It's fun. So, um, anyways…"
Reasoning:
Extended personal story about a local Austin car wash with colorful details. It does not materially advance the current deal analysis or financing/structure education for the active cases.
Context impact: Low – conversation resumes to Justin’s deal and next steps immediately after.
Recommended action: REMOVE ~00:35:00–00:36:10


Borderline Segments (Requires Review)

[BORDERLINE #1 - Requires Review]
Location: ~00:21:00–00:22:00
Content excerpt: 
"Athena: …time kills all deals… I’m picturing… a home that no one has been in… those buildings die quicker… Andrew: …mainly deferred maintenance… hot water heater starts leaking… $4,000 problem becomes $20,000…"
Business relevance argument: Uses a tangible analogy to reinforce deal momentum and the risk of delay (deal fatigue). It supports a key M&A principle: speed and momentum matter.
Personal content argument: The house/building maintenance analogy and specifics are tangential to the deal content.
Recommendation: KEEP – It strengthens an important strategic point (momentum). Short, connected to “time kills deals.”

[BORDERLINE #2 - Requires Review]
Location: ~00:33:00–00:34:10
Content excerpt:
"Justin: …she told me she got paid for this… Cabo… I go, what did you do with cash… she’s like, well, I have a safe at home… I was like, do you get a lot of those… she goes, uh, well I do drive a Maserati."
Business relevance argument: Indicates unreported cash practices and potential normalization/add-back considerations; relevant to diligence and bankability.
Personal content argument: Anecdotal and colorful; could be seen as gossip-like.
Recommendation: KEEP – Directly relevant to diligence, normalization, risk, and financing.

[BORDERLINE #3 - Requires Review]
Location: ~00:00:03–00:00:25
Content excerpt:
"Athena: Hello? Hello? Hey girl. How's it going? All right. Yourself? I'm really great. Thank you."
Business relevance argument: Very brief rapport-building/greeting; standard meeting open.
Personal content argument: Pure pleasantries.
Recommendation: KEEP – Brief and does not disrupt; guidelines allow short greetings.


Notes on Patterns and Systematic Issues

- “Performance-based note” repeatedly misheard as “performance space/performer space.” Consider targeted ASR vocabulary tuning for “performance-based note” and “earnout(s).”
- “Add-back(s)” misheard as “aback.” High-impact for diligence; add to ASR custom dictionary.
- Event name “SMBash” misheard as “S and Bash.” Add to ASR vocabulary.
- Names: “Ryan” vs “Brian” and “Anca/Onca,” “Barlow Williams/Williams and Barlow.” Encourage consistent speaker name tagging and verify firm/person names; add to custom entity list.
- Common phrase “if it goes south” misheard as “at Bico South.” Train on idioms.


Speaker Attribution and Flow

- No definitive speaker swaps detected; brief unlabeled “Mm-hmm” interjections appear in logical places.
- Several sentences show truncation/duplication that slightly obscure meaning (Errors #6, #8, #13). These do not appear to be speaker mix-ups but ASR clipping.


Summary

- High-priority technical/financial terms impacted: earnout(s), performance-based note, add-back(s), “balk,” SMBash, “if it goes south.”
- One recommended removal: a minute-long off-topic anecdote (Jurassic Car Wash).
- Borderline items largely support business points; recommended to keep for context and education.
