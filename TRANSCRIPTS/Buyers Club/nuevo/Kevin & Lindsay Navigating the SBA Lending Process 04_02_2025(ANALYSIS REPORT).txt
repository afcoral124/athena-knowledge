Detected transcription errors

[Error #1 - Category: Financial/Numerical Inconsistency]
Location: ~00:02:00 / Speaker: Athena
Transcript excerpt: "they closed on... business number two, just literally at the end of the year, January 30th, ... and the first one before that was in October."
Issue: Second closing date stated as “January 30th” while later Kevin states “December 30th.”
Likely intended: “December 30th” for the second closing (Kevin cites Oct 4 and Dec 30).
Confidence: High
Reasoning: “End of the year” contradicts January 30; Kevin provides specific dates later.
Impact: High – Date accuracy matters for timeline understanding.

[Error #2 - Category: Omission/Truncation]
Location: ~00:25:00 / Speaker: Kevin
Transcript excerpt: "we needed to find a lender who was willing to lend within 3 months of us closing an SBA. Well, so that was actually kind of a challenge..."
Issue: “closing an SBA.” appears truncated.
Likely intended: “closing an SBA loan.”
Confidence: High
Reasoning: Common phrasing; sentence otherwise incomplete.
Impact: Medium – Slightly disrupts clarity.

[Error #3 - Category: Business Terminology Distortion]
Location: ~00:27:00 / Speaker: Kevin
Transcript excerpt: "every bank's clothing process, the same that their lending process is different. The closing processes are different."
Issue: “clothing process” instead of “closing process.”
Likely intended: “closing process.”
Confidence: High
Reasoning: Topic is loan closing; “clothing” is a typical ASR substitution.
Impact: Medium

[Error #4 - Category: Misheard Acronym]
Location: ~00:51:00–00:52:00 / Speaker: Athena
Transcript excerpt: "you can end up spending a lot of money... before you actually close... what Kevin was saying... make sure that you hold off on the due diligence Aspects before you get a term sheet... if you've activated your QV..."
Issue: “QV” used where Quality of Earnings is meant.
Likely intended: “QoE” (Quality of Earnings).
Confidence: High
Reasoning: Due diligence context; QoE is standard; “QV” is a common ASR slip.
Impact: High – Changes technical meaning.

[Error #5 - Category: Business Terminology Distortion]
Location: ~00:47:00 / Speaker: Kevin
Transcript excerpt: "the bank might pull initially, that's not something you pay... the valuation up front was it call it an evaluation white."
Issue: “evaluation white” is nonsensical in this context.
Likely intended: “evaluation lite/light” (a light preliminary valuation).
Confidence: Medium
Reasoning: Lender doing a preliminary valuation “lite” is common; “white” is phonetic mishear.
Impact: Medium

[Error #6 - Category: Semantic Inconsistency]
Location: ~00:24:00 / Speaker: Kevin
Transcript excerpt: "break your own list of personal assets and liabilities."
Issue: “break your own list” is illogical.
Likely intended: “keep/create your own list of personal assets and liabilities.”
Confidence: High
Reasoning: He immediately describes maintaining/updating a running list.
Impact: Low

[Error #7 - Category: Omission/Misheard Word]
Location: ~01:12:30 / Speaker: Kevin
Transcript excerpt: "I got prime plus 1.95, six for three years, and then it goes to variable..."
Issue: “1.95, six” is garbled.
Likely intended: “prime plus 1.95, fixed for three years.”
Confidence: High
Reasoning: He is contrasting fixed vs variable terms.
Impact: High – Affects understanding of loan terms.

[Error #8 - Category: Entity Name Consistency]
Location: ~00:29:00 and ~00:59:00 / Speaker: Kevin
Transcript excerpts: "having Mathias and Pioneer Capital..." and later "we were introduced to Matthias over at pioneer capital."
Issue: Two spellings of the same person’s name.
Likely intended: One consistent spelling (“Mathias” or “Matthias”).
Confidence: Medium
Reasoning: Refers to same lending broker; inconsistent rendering suggests ASR variance.
Impact: Low–Medium

[Error #9 - Category: Speaker/Label Artifact]
Location: ~00:23:00–00:24:00 / Unattributed
Transcript excerpt: "... Most banks are going to do another business valuation. And then you go hard into the closing process, which is it's, it's, yeah, it's own really fun set of ups and downs and rollercoaster rides. Speaker 1 ... Speaker 1"
Issue: “Speaker 1” appears as stray labels mid-paragraph.
Likely intended: No speaker tag mid-utterance; continues Kevin.
Confidence: High
Reasoning: Flow matches Kevin’s monologue; tags inserted erroneously.
Impact: Medium – Causes attribution confusion.

[Error #10 - Category: Entity Naming Consistency]
Location: ~01:14:30 / Speaker: Kevin
Transcript excerpt: "Huntington bank... they're one of the larger SBA lenders."
Issue: Elsewhere he says “Huntington National Bank.”
Likely intended: Use one consistent formal name.
Confidence: Medium
Reasoning: Same institution; inconsistency likely ASR/editorial variation.
Impact: Low

[Error #11 - Category: Minor Grammar (obscures meaning slightly)]
Location: ~01:13:10 / Speaker: Athena
Transcript excerpt: "fixed it 8 percent for the 1st, 3 years."
Issue: “fixed it 8 percent” likely “fixed at 8 percent.”
Likely intended: “fixed at 8% for the first 3 years.”
Confidence: Medium
Reasoning: Common phrase; “it” vs “at” ASR slip.
Impact: Low

Segments to remove

[REMOVAL #1 - Type: Small Talk/Greetings]
Location: 00:00:00–00:00:45
Speakers involved: Athena
Content excerpt:
"Hello. Hello. Hey, Gil. Hey, Jason. Yay. Jason's here... Justin's new. He'll be starting his search soon. Steven Polly in Atlanta. How you doing? Cool. Nice, nice crew today."
Reasoning:
Opening roll call and pleasantries; no business content.
Context impact: None
Recommended action: REMOVE 00:00:00–00:00:45

[REMOVAL #2 - Type: Closings/Small Talk]
Location: 01:19:30–01:21:00
Speakers involved: Athena, Ryan
Content excerpt:
"...Great to see everyone. We'll see you on Thursday... Bye y'all. ... Bye."
Reasoning:
Closing pleasantries and scheduling; no substantive business content.
Context impact: None
Recommended action: REMOVE 01:19:30–01:21:00

[REMOVAL #3 - Type: Administrative/Off-topic to core content]
Location: ~00:50:10–00:50:35
Speakers involved: Athena
Content excerpt:
"...he's in the buyers club, slack channel and Lindsay is too... So if you have any questions... throw your hands up."
Reasoning:
Session logistics about Slack and hand-raising—not educational content about deals/financing.
Context impact: Low
Recommended action: REMOVE ~00:50:10–00:50:35

Borderline segments (requires review)

[BORDERLINE #1 - Requires Review]
Location: ~00:03:20
Content excerpt: "Lindsay's not feeling well, but they did this together..."
Business relevance argument: Minor context about why she’s absent from presenting; relates to who executed the deals.
Personal content argument: Health status is personal and not business-relevant.
Recommendation: REMOVE – minimal impact if omitted.

[BORDERLINE #2 - Requires Review]
Location: ~01:16:30–01:19:30
Content excerpt: "We are going to be sharing the slides with the replay... template personal financial statements... link... Q&A doc..."
Business relevance argument: These resources are directly related to the financing process (PFS tracking, anticipated lender Q&A) and support execution.
Personal content argument: Session administration and distribution details may be ancillary to the educational narrative.
Recommendation: KEEP – Materials directly support implementing the discussed best practices.

[BORDERLINE #3 - Requires Review]
Location: ~00:29:00–00:31:00
Content excerpt: “Mathias and Pioneer Capital... world’s best advocate…”
Business relevance argument: Demonstrates value of using a lending broker in closing; instructive for buyer strategy.
Personal content argument: Contains subjective praise/testimonial.
Recommendation: KEEP – Illustrative of broker role and impact on closing.

Speaker attribution validation
- The “Speaker 1” tags inserted around ~00:23:00–00:24:00 appear to be artifacts; the surrounding content is consistent with Kevin’s continuous explanation of underwriting/closing. Recommend correcting/removing stray tags.

Cross-reference and consistency notes
- Closing dates: Ensure consistency (Oct 4 and Dec 30) per Kevin’s detailed statement; Athena’s “January 30th” likely ASR error.
- Name consistency: Standardize the broker’s name (“Mathias” vs “Matthias”) and the bank’s formal name (“Huntington National Bank”).
- Acronyms: Use “QoE” for Quality of Earnings throughout; avoid “QV”.
- Loan term phrasing: Clarify “prime + 1.95, fixed for three years” before converting to variable to avoid confusion.

Patterns to note for ASR improvement
- “Closing” often misheard as “clothing.”
- “Lite/light” often rendered as “white.”
- “Fixed” misrecognized as “six.”
- Quality of Earnings “QoE” misheard as “QV.”
- Random speaker tags (“Speaker 1”) injected mid-utterance.
- Minor preposition errors (“at” vs “it”).

Overall guidance
- Retain nearly all substantive content—it’s rich in financing process detail, lender management strategies, and practical structuring insights.
- Remove only pure greetings/closings and minor session logistics to streamline.
