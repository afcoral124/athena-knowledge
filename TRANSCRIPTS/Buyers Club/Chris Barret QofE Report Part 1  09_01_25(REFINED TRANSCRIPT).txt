[00:00:00]
Athena: Hello. Hello. Hey, Jason. Hey, good afternoon. My team is here. Amazing. Hey, I think we got a few more people joining now. Um, but so, so, so excited for this conversation today, because this is a really important one and a really helpful one to all of you in your acquisition journey. So, um, we are going to be hearing from Chris Barrett, who is epic at doing QoEs and all things finance and due diligence.

[00:01:00]
Athena: Um, so, uh, what we're going to be doing today is hearing from Chris. He's got a whole presentation that he's prepared for you, and we've kind of talked at length on, you know, the different stages at which you should be looking at different parts of the finances. And particularly in small businesses, the finances are not going to be clean and look like the things that you might see in larger businesses. So there are certain things that you can be looking out for and things to be aware of, or pay attention to, or concerned about at various stages. So we're hopefully going to be breaking this up in the 3 different major stages, which is before you've signed an, and you have very limited access to financials, like what are the things that you can be looking out for? And then immediately after signing the LOI, you might get access to some more financials. So you want to do some checks before you actually order a QoE from someone like Chris, which is a pretty in‑depth report. Um, and what are the things you can look out for there? And then for many of you, you might not have seen what a QoE report actually looks like. What's included in financial diligence? What things can you like wait until you get to that point? So Chris is going to take us through, uh, that and show us what that looks like, what, why you need certain aspects of that, and at what point that you should engage him. And then after we'll have plenty of time for questions. So you can ask follow up questions. I'll probably prompt him with some things, common challenges that we're seeing and that sort of thing. Um, but super excited. Chris is here to share his knowledge and experience. Experience with us. So Chris, if you want to do a quick intro on you before you dive in. I don't know if that was part of your presentation, but, uh, yeah, take it away.

[00:03:00]
Chris: Yeah, sure. Thanks for that. I appreciate it. I'm excited to chat with everybody today. Um, I'm going to share my screen if that's okay. Do I have permission? Yeah, there we go. Looks like it. Um, you know if this comes up right. Uh, let's see. Does this work? Can you see that still? Looks okay? Yep, that looks great. Awesome. Well, yeah, today, I'm excited to talk a little about QoEs. Uh, I guess just quick background on me. So my name is Chris Barrett. I run Midwest CPA. Um, we are an accounting firm focused on working with acquisition entrepreneurs. I started the firm back in 2022. Um, I personally had been interested in ETA because I think like a lot of people ended up working with, um, you know, had a good job making good money, wanted to own a business and didn't really feel like starting from zero. The startup made a lot of sense. Um, so my original plan was to start a firm as a side hustle. And then if I liked it, I was gonna go buy a firm to quit my job. Uh, things went a little better than expected with the side hustle. And I quit my job a few months later and we've now grown pretty quickly. I got a team of eight people. Um, in 2024, we worked on 61 deals for QoEs, uh, for a variety of different industries. You know, a lot of the typical ones like the trades and, uh, you know, professional services, um, but then also lots of like, uh, some light manufacturing deals and SaaS businesses and e‑commerce and all sorts of fun stuff. Uh, we also have part of our business that is working with small business owners post closing as well. Uh, the majority of our monthly clients that we help with bookkeeping, tax, fractional CFO, almost all of them bought their business. So it's really fun to be able to work with them through the whole life cycle of their, uh, their acquisition journey. It's pretty fun.

[00:05:00]
Chris: Today, I guess I missed this. So quick overview what I plan to touch on here and feel free to interrupt me. And if I'm not talking about stuff you want to hear about, feel free to push me along. I'm going to give a quick overview of what a QoE is. Why should get one? What's included? Um, I want to talk about some of the most common deal killers that we see in the quality of earnings process. So things that you could be looking for, um, really the whole time you're looking at a new deal that should just be in the back of your mind, um, as you're looking through the financials and then a few things you'd be looking at before you start hiring service providers, uh, so that you can hopefully catch things early and reduce the risk of the deal costs. And feel, uh, we'll open up for Q&A at the end. If, um, if you have questions throughout too, feel free to interrupt me. Happy to just, uh, break off where, where needed.

[00:06:00]
Chris: All right. Um, quick overview of, uh, QoE. So why get one? Um, that's probably the most important question. Um, the first reason I think it's really important to get one is, uh, you're working to balance the information disadvantage you have as a buyer. So when you first look at a deal, right? You see a listing online or you get sent one in your inbox. Um, the seller knows everything about the business. And you start off, you know, nothing. And through the process of, you know, getting under LOI and then the diligence phase, your goal is to get as close to knowing as much as a seller knows as possible. Um, that's never going to happen. You're never going to know everything that seller knows, but by doing things like a QoE, you are hopefully going to get much closer, um, to understanding the business and the financials a lot better, and identifying things such as like red flags, potential risk factors that you need to be mitigating, or just information black holes, like, hey, this is something that we are not ever going to be able to know.

Oh, so one example that a deal I'm working on right now, we're trying to calculate some of the profitability by job for this, uh, for this particular deal. They don't track the information. It's, you know, we can do some back‑of‑the‑napkin stuff to try and back into it and get kind of close. At the end of the day, there's some small business—with a small business there's some things where, you know, there's a black hole of information and you want to determine how big is your risk factor going into those, those information black holes. Um, and if it is too big a risk factor, then, you know, you can kill the deal there. Um, we're gonna talk a bit about valuation and bridging enterprise value to purchase price on the next slide, so I might skip those for a quick second.

[00:08:00]
Chris: QoE will also help you with negotiations. So let's say you do find things in the deal that, you know, you're expecting the deal to be a million bucks in EBITDA. QoE comes back at 800 or 800 grand EBITDA. Having a full report by a third party with support for why the financials were not as good as what the seller said they were, um, is going to give you a lot more firepower going into that either retrade conversation, um, into that retrade conversation to make sure that you have the support that you need to give you the best likelihood of success. You know, retrades are hard. A lot of times it won't work out, but it's a lot more likely it's going to be able to work out, uh, if you do have a solid QoE. We had a client, he worked on this deal for a long time. I think we finished the QoE last year in April. He finally closed in December. Uh, the starting purchase price was 8 million bucks. Uh, he ended up closing in December for 4 million. Um, and a lot of those things that reduced purchase price were items that we were finding in the QoE, uh, cause EBITDA was lower, so there were some risk factors that we didn't know about earlier. Um, and so it is possible to be able to bring this report to a seller and renegotiate a deal. Uh, we can also help with your attorneys, you know, making sure that you have the right language around certain financial things in the purchase agreement, especially working capital, it's always a really big one. Um, and then post closing, you're going to be running this business. So you want to understand where the current processes for accounting and then how can you fix some of those, um, post close or some of the integration things that you know about.

[00:09:00]
Chris: Talk a little about purchase price. Ultimately, everything we're looking at in a quality of earnings report impacts purchase price in some way. Uh, the thing that people focus on the most is enterprise value. Um, but these other factors are really important in calculating what is the end purchase price that you're actually going to pay for the business that you're buying. Um, so the first one, right, the, uh, when we talk about the most—enterprise value—you're buying this business for a multiple of some measure of cash flow, usually EBITDA or SDE. And so first you want to figure out what is the actual economic EBITDA of the business. So the seller says it's one number. We want to normalize for possible one‑time events, risk factors, accounting errors to get to what is the actual economic figure that you can then use to project into the future as the new business owner.

The other side of that is the multiple. So, uh, the multiple is oftentimes driven by how risky is this deal? What are the various risk factors? How much can you rely on these earnings into the future? Um, and so in a QoE, we're going to pull out those risk factors, make sure that you understand them so that you're going eyes wide open into the, into this deal.

Another piece of ultimately getting to purchase price is are you buying any hidden liabilities? So generally you're buying this business cash free, debt free, uh, but there could be liabilities that, uh, they might not be from a bank. There might not be an amortization schedule. But they look, touch, smell, and taste a lot like that. Um, two examples of that that we can give just real quick would be—the most common that we'd see would be—unearned revenue, right? So seller has been paid, let's say 500,000 for work that he has not yet done. And then you're coming in and buying this business. And so the assumption is you're now going to have to do that work. Uh, well, you need to be compensated for that. So whether that be the seller leaves that 500 grand for you, or you, uh, you have a direct reduction in purchase price for that 500,000, there needs to be some way that you're compensated for the work that the seller has been paid for, but then you're going to end up doing.

Another one that we've seen that is, you know, the calculation of it sometimes can be more of an art than a science, but, uh, we've seen a few times with, um, like deferred maintenance. You know, maybe they have a fleet of trucks. We look through our analysis, all these trucks are really old. Um, we can tell that right around the time the seller was deciding to sell the business, the repairs and maintenance expense went through the floor. Um, and they, you know, they stopped kind of their upkeep. And now you're coming in as a buyer and to get things back up to snuff, you have to spend a certain amount of money to get things back up to standard. Um, there should be some compensation there to make sure that you're, you're, you're being kept whole. Um, so that can sometimes be considered a debt‑like item as well.

[00:12:00]
Chris: The final piece is working capital. We'll dive into this, uh, more and more later as well, but when you're buying a business, the expectation is that you have everything you need to continue operations into the future. Um, and so if you buy the business on day one and you now need to bring in more capital—whether from your savings or, um, from, uh, an investor or whatever—to keep operations running, you effectively paid more for the business. Um, and so if you're not going to get a normalized level of working capital in the deal, uh, then purchase price should be adjusted accordingly. Or the other side of the equation: if you're getting more working capital than the normalized level, then the seller needs to be compensated in some way—whether they get to keep that portion of the working capital or purchase price is changed or what have you—just to make sure that both parties are getting a, uh, a fair amount.

Something that we see, I'd say about 70 percent of the deals we work on, working capital is being left in the deal with some calculation, um, where, you know, some combination of AR, inventory, and payables are being left for the, um, for the buyer to take over. And they're including it in the purchase price. I say about 30 percent of the deals, the buyer, just to simplify things, will say, seller, you can leave everything—you can keep everything, keep the AR, um, keep all the working capital. Then as the buyer, you need to know how much you should then adjust purchase price for. So if you're going to buy a business and a normalized level of working capital on that business is 500 grand and you're buying a business for 3 million bucks and you're going to let the seller keep all the working capital, then really the purchase price then should be 2.5 million to make sure that you're not overpaying for that business.

[00:14:00]
Jason: Yeah. Hey, uh, Chris, do most people understand that as a seller? So, you know, the seller goes in saying, all this money in this bank account is mine. Even in the working capital, but they still want to kind of keep the same purchase price. Is it difficult to kind of convey?

Chris: Yeah, it can be. Um, there are, uh, there's some sellers if they have a good advisor. They're going to usually be prepped ahead of time that, you know, the buyer is going to want to normalize a level of working capital. Here's how we calculate it, and they calculate it in a reasonable manner, in a fair manner. Um, and then the buyer comes in, we calculate, and we're pretty similar in the ballpark, and everything goes smoothly. Um, there's some times where, like, I've gotten brain damage from trying to explain, uh, working capital to the sellers in some cases. Um, and in that case, like if you feel like, okay, I'm going into this and I don't think they're going to want to leave anything, um, and it's going to be a real pain to explain that and then borrow what you need. And I'd say that's about 30 percent of the deals that I work on that ends up happening. It's because they're just not worth the negotiation to try and get to that figure. Um, you might as well just adjust your purchase price accordingly and, and borrow what you need from the bank.

[00:15:00]
Jason: Does that usually, uh, kill a deal? So, right. They're stuck on a number, but you're saying, Hey, I'm, I'm going to reduce this purchase price. Cause I have to have working capital.

Chris: Uh, it can. So I would, I would look at that like pre‑LOI. So when you're going to submit your LOI. Like if, if you want to simplify things and you're buying a business and you think that it's worth three turns of EBITDA, and it's a million bucks in EBITDA. You're gonna buy it for three million bucks. But it needs 500 grand of working capital. And you don't want to go through the headache of trying to negotiate working capital with the seller. You can just offer 2.5. Now what you're not kind of being taken advantage of, and you don't have to, uh, negotiate that. Now, you know, the seller doesn't have to accept your offer, right? Um, they might get other offers though, that say I'll do for 3 million, but I want to keep all of your accounts receivable. Um, so just make sure that they're aware of that and can understand it and how that impacts them. Um, and then it all washes out in the end of the day, right? If they're going to buy a business for 3 million bucks and all the AR's included and there's 500‑grand AR, or if you're buying the business for 2.5 million and the seller's keeping the AR, it washes out the same way in the end.

[00:17:00]
Athena: So, um, Jason's actually actively in a negotiation pre‑LOI on this. And, um, I should have said at the beginning of the call, uh, we're going to actually hold Jason on a little bit later after Chris has done to, to talk through that and some negotiation strategies and what to do in this particular case. So, um, I think that's, uh, Chris, some context for you is it's off market, so they don't have an advisor. So there's some education that needs to be done with the seller. So we'll talk tactics with you, Jason, on that afterwards, because it's a really important point and a lot of times there's just a really, uh, not understanding of what working capital is, and to further paint that picture when I was at the Texas Association of Business Brokers conference with guys that have been doing this for 30 years. And these are the brokers themselves. And they were finally wrapping their head around why working capital has to be included in purchase price if it's going to be valued as a going concern. Um, Chris, before we move on to the next stuff, is there, uh, an explanation or a tactic that you've seen that works really well to kind of convey to sellers and brokers or way of explaining it for them to kind of wrap their head around the concept?

[00:18:00]
Chris: Yeah, I mean, the analogy I hear a lot and I think works pretty well, um, is people have different versions of it, right? The blood in the body, the gas in the car, whatever, right? Um, if you buy a car and it's on empty and you can't get it out of the lot, well, it's not worth very much, right? Um, I think showing them that—and I've had many calls where we've walked through us just showing them that—here's the cash flow and in these months, my cash will go negative. And if I don't have that money coming in from those receivables, um, then I'm effectively paying more for the business. And there are cases where you can explain that to a seller and they're going to say, that's not my problem. So, um, I oftentimes advise my client: lean on the broker. I know that the deal you're talking about right now is off market, but that's why off market is so much more difficult because you don't have that broker to lean on to explain it to them, because if you're explaining it to them as the buyer, you know, you're kind of like the enemy right and not—hopefully doesn't feel too much like that—but you are the other side and they might feel like you're explaining this complicated financial jargon, um, and trying to pull the wool over their eyes. So, usually what I advise my clients we'll do is I will call the broker and walk them through our calculation. Um, and that's usually a lot easier of a conversation than trying to just walk the seller through it. Or just get their accountant on the call too. Because if they don't have a broker, I've done that before too, where we've got the accountant on the call. And if their accountant understands working capital, which isn't always the case, but more likely than not, they will, um, you can go through that calculation with them and then get into the, uh, get into the same ballpark of each other. You just don't want to make it feel like your, uh, yeah, the seller feels like they're getting taken for a ride. Like they don't understand what you're saying. You're on the other side of the table, you know, having someone on their side of the table that they can find some common ground with, um, can be really effective—and having a third party for you too. So like you're kind of out of the equation. Um, and so it's, you know, someone like Athena or myself talking to their advisor—like that conversation just makes you not feel like the bad guy in the conversations.

[00:21:00]
Athena: Thanks Chris. And Jason, we'll, we'll pick up specifically with your deal after Chris is done and talk through some tactics on specifically, cause I have some ideas on, on how you can get over this, this next hump with, uh, the seller, but great questions.

Jason: Sorry to take over.

Athena: No, no, no, they're good questions because it's a working capital conversation. It was one of the things I did want to touch on anyway, and I'm sure more questions will come up around this as Chris carries on because I think a spoiler alert is one of the biggest deal killers. So carry on Chris.

[00:21:20]
Chris: Yeah, absolutely. Um, I just wanted to show a quick a few—like this is very much not an exhaustive list—of QoE adjustments. There's some things that we do see, um, when we're working through a quality of earnings report. So non‑recurring transactions, you know, one‑time events. We're going to see those added back. Just a couple of examples of those. Maybe donations could be a one‑time event, or if they've hired a consultant to help with the deal, that'd be a transaction cost—get that added back. Or they moved the location within the last couple of years of the business. A lot of times we'll consider that a one‑time event.

Correcting errors. Small business owners, you know, they don't have a full in‑house finance and accounting team. There's going to be errors in their accounting. Um, you know, revenue recognition is always a very big one. Are they recognizing revenue and expenses at the proper time? Um, so figuring out through conversations with the sell side, figuring out when they are recognizing revenue and then determining when they should be and then doing some math to figure out—

[00:22:05]
Athena: If you don't mind, on these three points—the correcting errors—could you explain what revenue recognition actually means and normalization and that sort of thing? Just in case folks aren't familiar with the finance terms here. That would be super helpful.

[00:22:20]
Chris: Yeah, absolutely. And we'll deep dive revenue recognition—spoiler, that's number two deal killer. Um, but so when—the proper way to recognize revenue, which means when revenue should be booked into your financial statements, like I've made a sale—is that I'm going to book it on my books as of this day when it is earned. Um, so when you as the business owner have the rights to that money. That money is yours. You've done the work to satisfy your obligation; those funds are now yours. That's the proper way to do it. Now you'll see very frequently, uh, if you're looking at deals, uh, that's not usually how it's being done in small businesses. A lot of times they're booking it maybe when they receive the cash, or they might be booking it when they invoice, but they might not invoice at the right time necessarily. Uh, so especially if there's like a project‑based business, this is something I've been dealing with a lot lately. Um, I've probably had like 15 deals like this in the past three months, uh, where there's just a lot of project‑based revenue. And if you have a project that takes you eight months to do, um, and you might bill 30 percent up front, but you haven't had any expenses yet on that project. Well, that month is going to look really weird on your financials when you had booked all this revenue in one month, but none of the expenses associated with that revenue have been booked. Um, and you haven't done the work to earn that revenue yet. Uh, so the proper way to do it would be once you've completed a certain percentage of your work, then you book the revenue and then that would match properly with the expenses associated with it. Um, so that's something that I'd say is a really common thing to see wrong.

Normalizing expenses. Um, so I guess one example of like a normalized expense would be—we had a deal recently where there was a quality assurance manager position that they had really been struggling to hire for. Uh, so about six months they were open on that position. However, that was a needed position in the business. So to normalize for that expense, we then added that expense in to show here's the business—here's what the financials look like with that expense coming out of the financials. If you don't have that expense in there for six months, you're overstating EBITDA, right? Another example you see a lot is if they own the building that they run the business out of, you might see rent expense. And that rent expense might not necessarily be market. So you want to figure out, all right, am I buying the building? Am I not buying the building? What is the seller going to charge me rent? Or, uh, what would fair market rent be? If I am buying a building, there should still be rent on the books. So you should normalize for that as well. Um, that's just a couple examples of normalizing expenses. Does that help?

[00:25:20]
Athena: Yeah, that's great. Sorry. I was nodding.

Chris: That's good. Um, also some pro forma adjustments that happen. So, um, if there's been a recent new hire in the business—so kind of going off the last example—maybe like three months ago, they made a new hire as the business has been growing, you want to represent the financials as if that new hire had been there for a longer period of time. Maybe they changed a key vendor. You want to show that going back in history, or maybe they stopped offering a certain product—you know, you want to show the business without that product involved, uh, would be a pro forma adjustment.

[00:26:20]
Chris: All right. Uh, biggest deal killer is definitely working capital. Um, we've touched on this a little bit already, but the main reason for it is, right, the buyer and seller have different objectives when it comes to working capital. The buyer wants to maintain or even possibly reduce purchase price, and for that reason, their bias is going to be—they want the working capital target to be as high as possible, and they want as much accounts receivable as they can get. They want as much money as they can get to fund the business post close. The seller, on the other hand, wants to either maintain or possibly even increase purchase price, and they can do that by keeping the target for working capital as low as possible.

If you're very unfamiliar with working capital, the way that I like to visualize it is: it's the hole between when you pay for things in your business and when you get paid for things in your business. So if you took like a really simple timeline, a really simple business that maybe on day zero, they buy inventory; on day 30, because they have terms with their vendors, they pay for that inventory—so now the money has gone out of their hands on day 30—and then they sell that inventory on day 60; and then on day 90, because they have terms with their customers, they get paid. That means that they spent money on day 30. They got that money back on day 90. So between day 30 and day 90—60 days—is a 60‑day period where they need to fund operations because the money has gone out the door. They need to fund the business while the money is, uh, is out with their vendors, um, and waiting for it to return from their customers. So you want to measure how much money you need to fund the operations of that company for 60 days.

[00:28:00]
Chris: And we're going to talk later in the kind of pre‑LOI stage, but, uh, a hack for getting like at least close pre‑LOI on what is that figure that you should be asking for, for working capital, um, is to do that calculation—figure out how long it takes them to get paid, how long they keep inventory on hand, how long it takes them to pay other people. And you can figure out when is that period? Is it 60 days? Is it 30 days? Is it 10 days? Um, and then just multiply that figure by an average sales per day. Uh, and that can get you at least in the ballpark. Um, once you have access to everything and you're in a quality of earnings process, you can get really specific and get the exact figure. Um, but at least if you're pre‑LOI and you just have a CIM with annual financials, um, this is a really great way to just back‑of‑the‑napkin calculate, uh, what the, uh, what the working capital figure should be, should be asking for.

[00:29:00]
Chris: Deal killer number two, um, revenue recognition. So we talked about this a little bit, right? You should be recognizing revenue, um, when you've earned it. Uh, I just wanted to show an example from a project we finished last August, um, what it can look like when you're not recognizing revenue properly and then when you are recognizing revenue properly. So this deal, this is actually a landscaping company that had very seasonal, uh, revenue. Um, and in conversations with the seller, uh, we learned about the seasonality of their revenue, uh, and it made sense to us for the location that the business was in, um, and the lines of work that they did that, yeah, they're going to make almost all their money in the spring, summer, uh, early fall. And then they're going to have very little money coming in in the winter months. However, when we looked at the revenue, it was pretty flat. It was down a little bit in the off season, but it wasn't down, uh, as extreme as we would have expected after talking with the sellers and just understanding the business. Um, we were able to do an analysis to convert the way that they were recognizing revenue, which was on a cash basis. We were able to convert it to an accrual basis. And the top is what the seller provided to us. And then the bottom is after we made all of our adjustments, you can see that the revenue makes sense now, right? It actually is a seasonal business. The revenue does drop a lot in the winter months. And, um, uh, and yeah, it just made a lot more sense once we were able to make that calculation.

[00:31:00]
Chris: And it's going to have a pretty profound impact on EBITDA. So as I was saying earlier, um, if you book all of your revenue in one month and don't properly match the expenses in that month, um, you could—and you look at the business on a trailing 12‑month period or any 12‑month period—if you're grabbing a period with all of the revenue and none of the expenses, uh, you're gonna be overstating revenue or overstating EBITDA on that company. Um, so when we did this particular deal, uh, this is a screenshot from the real file, um, you could see right there, the first adjustment, the cash‑to‑accrual adjustment for the trailing 12‑month period, it ended up having over a $200,000 impact on EBITDA because they were recognizing revenue improperly. Um, because they had all of this revenue booked in one month and none of the expenses against it. And when we made the adjustment, you know, things made a lot more sense. This was a particular deal we were able to bring up to the seller and show that to them. And there was a significant reduction in purchase price and the buyer should actually be closing later this month.

[00:32:00]
Chris: Uh, pre‑LOI, um, and I guess post‑LOI before you start hiring people—so really just before you start paying money for service providers—um, a few things that I think are, are very good to do, looking out for. Um, first one would be large swings year over year in really anything on their P&L. I'd say revenue is always a really big one. Um, you need to have a really good explanation for, um, why there was a large dip in revenue in one particular year. Um, banks are gonna be asking about that. Investors are gonna be asking about that. There needs to be a good story, but you also want to look at the other categories. So their gross margin—has that changed dramatically over a year? And if you're seeing big swings in gross margin, especially like month‑to‑month swings in gross margin or even annually, it's a pretty good indicator that they're not doing the revenue recognition right. If you see one month, um, gross margin is 80 percent and the next month, the gross margin is negative 20 percent. Um, that probably means they're not recognizing revenue properly and they're putting all the revenue in one month and all the expenses in the other month.

I was talking with a client actually earlier today who's going to work on retrading their deal because they were presented a CIM that showed, um, last year—excuse me, year‑to‑date financials through November for this business, um, but they hadn't recognized revenue properly and dumped a bunch of revenue into the early part of 2024 that should have been booked back at the end of 2023. And it's about a $600,000 swing for the particular business, um, because they hadn't recognized their revenue properly. So that's something that you can pick out pretty quickly if you're looking at a CIM and you see, oh, year‑to‑date gross margin is 40 percent, last year and the year before that and year before that gross margin was 30 percent. What's changed? There has to be a really good story, or there's something wrong with their accounting.

[00:34:30]
Chris: I'm in the ballpark with the seller on working capital. Like I said, working capital is always a huge one. You don't want to kick the can down the road on the working capital conversation. I've had, um, I was actually talking to a guy today who—he did eventually close on a deal—but the first deal that he did not close on, he waited to have the conversation with the seller on working capital until about two weeks before closing. And he had about six figures in dead deal costs because of it. Uh, the seller and him were off on working capital by seven figures because they just—they each assumed that they were on the same page, and they absolutely were not. So you might not have a firm figure on what you're going to be asking for working capital, but I would caution you against just saying, you know, it's going to be a normalized level of working capital and just kick that can completely down the road. At least have that conversation of “I think it's going to be around this range,” so that, you know, each party just knows what to expect and it's not—there's not gonna be any big shocks.

[00:35:15]
Chris: Um, if you do, you know, get under LOI, you start getting more information, you can start doing things like tying the CIM into the tax returns, tying the books to the tax returns, just making sure that at a high level, they're, you know, things are matching up, um, and they're not reporting one number to you on the CIM and then just completely different numbers, um, elsewhere. If you are seeing really weird add‑backs, and that's always an indicator—you know, maybe they're adding back like marketing expenses or, you know, they're saying, oh, you don't actually need this hire, even though this position has been filled for the past four years, and you're adding back that position. Um, things like that. Uh, and then final one, like, is the seller really committed? This is especially important if it's an off market deal. Off market deals can take a really long time to close because you have to get the seller to that point where they're ready to sell. Um, but this also happens with broker deals too. Like you want to be working with a seller that they have a real reason to sell their business. Um, it doesn't really—the reason that like all of us are here and like, like the idea of buying a small business is because you buy them for a great multiple. You're buying for a three, four, five X multiple. Well, on the seller side, uh, the deal is kind of rotten because if they're making a million bucks a year, uh, and they're going to sell for a three X, after taxes and paying their intermediary, um, they're really getting like one and a half times EBITDA for that business. Uh, it almost would make more sense to just sit on it if it's as passive as they say it is. Right. They want to—or they just hold it for another 18 months and then sell it. Um, so there has to be a really good reason—you know, they're retiring, they're moving, right? Um, they're, you know, they're just ready to move on, they're sick, someone else is sick, whatever—something's going on that they're really committed to getting rid of that business because you don't want to be, oh, they're kind of feeling it out and they wonder what someone would offer. And you get in the situation where you're under LOI and you're hiring all these people and spending all this money and then they decide, eh, I don't really like that number. I'm just going to hold on to it. So you really want to make sure the seller is committed to selling.

[00:38:00]
Chris: Okay. Quick recap, um, you know, financial due diligence—the objectives, you know, we're looking to make sure that financial information is as accurate as possible, that the quality of the information that you're getting is as good as possible as the buyer and you know what you're getting into when you're buying this business. Um, we want to make sure that we're focusing all of our attention on the things that are really important in the deal—we're not wasting time, spinning your wheels on things that aren't important—and we're focusing on the critical things. Um, you know, when you're doing due diligence, the seller has presented this company in a way that looks as favorable as possible. Um, and they're going to beef up EBITDA. Um, they're going to, you know, maybe they'll, they'll hide certain things or like not outwardly mention certain things because they want you to buy it and they want to get as much money as they possibly can. Um, you as the buyer need to make sure you're having good diligence done or doing good diligence to make sure you're uncovering those things. And you're not overpaying for a bad deal. Um, not to like scare anyone or give like horror stories, but I did have a client who, um, he came to us—he got referred to us by a lender—he was going to do a QoE. The lender said he needed to get a QoE done. Um, the seller convinced him, “Oh, it's going to be too much of a hassle. Don't worry about it. Use my lender. We're going to get the deal done. Um, don't waste your money on a QoE.” You know, not getting one. Um, six weeks after closing on the business, he was calling bankruptcy attorneys. Uh, and it's because of things that would have—like, honestly, he might not even need a QoE—but he needed someone in his corner to do really, you know, at least cursory diligence to find the things that were wrong with this business. Maybe the first red flag should have been that the seller was telling him not to have diligence done. But there is serious risk, right, when you're buying a business and ultimately making sure that you're getting really good diligence done is, uh, it's really important to make sure that you stay out of those, uh, you know, reducing the risk of you getting into those sorts of situations.

[00:40:00]
Chris: All right. Awesome. Well, I hope that was helpful. Happy to answer any and all questions and I would love to connect with anyone after the call too if, um, maybe I can help. Feel free to reach out to me any of these places.

Athena: Amazing, Chris, super helpful. So we'll be grabbing the recording from this and Chris's contact details and dropping that into the channel. I have a few questions or, like, general things that we're seeing that I think would be good to talk through. Uh, and then I imagine folks here will have some questions as well. I saw Jason posted one earlier in the chat that we want to make sure that we cover off. So the things to look out for pre‑LOI. Can you help them to understand like what is just a FYI and a flag versus like deal breaker at that stage? So if there's big swings, for example, in the gross margin, is that, is that like a deal breaker or is it something that you just want to pay attention to and you want to go a little bit deeper? What's your feelings on those things that you said to look out for pre‑LOI and what's, what's a deal breaker versus—yeah, where—and keep going.

[00:41:00]
Chris: Yeah. So it kind of ties back to the story. Like you can go if you want to ask more questions. If you see gross margin has changed significantly, you got to be asking questions of why has it changed so much. Um, and when you go and ask those questions—like I had a deal recently, actually, I think Athena, we worked on this deal together. Um, gross margin had increased pretty significantly, but it had come right after a—they had done, like as a company, made a very cognizant decision that they are going to increase prices for their customers. And they had a pricing sheet and they updated it. And it was right at that time you saw gross margin increase. Like it was, it was obvious that you could tie that back and it made sense. Um, so in that case, it's not a flag. I mean, something you want to ask about, but it's not necessarily an issue with the business—it’s actually, it almost gives you, um, you know, some comfort that, oh, they have room to raise prices. Like they were able to raise prices, people kept coming back. Um, this might be a good business. In that case, that almost makes it look better. Um, but in the other case, there could be like, “Oh no, we haven't updated our prices ever. Um, I don't know why it's changed.” Uh, they don't have a good answer. And then it's like, okay, you have to start thinking this might not make sense. And this is, this is an issue.

[00:42:30]
Athena: What I mean, all of that, I think, is stuff that can be uncovered as you go through the process. Not necessarily a deal—like, what do you think is like a genuine deal killer? Like, don't move forward—that you see—or, you know, genuine red flag. Don't move forward on a deal.

Chris: I think how honest and good of a seller you have is really important for not only getting a deal done, but your success post closing. Like if you have a crumb—it's, it's going to get intense. Like through the process of buying the business, it gets intense. Then even post closing, it gets intense. Like you're going to be changing things. You're now the new owner. You're now your way of thinking; they have their way. They've done it for 30 years. They're going to have staff that like them and, um, maybe don't like you as much. And so it gets really difficult. Um, but if you're, if you're working with someone that's like a reasonable person and like a good person and honest person, um, you can get through a lot of that. But if you start getting a hint that, “Oh, I think they're lying to me about this one thing,” or they're trying to hide something, or I just don't trust them for whatever reason—it's just not worth it. Um, no matter how good the deal is, if your seller is, is giving you the heebie jeebies, it's, it's time to walk away.

[00:44:00]
Athena: I think that's such a great point and something to flag, right? Like, and, and you and I were talking about this when we were talking about you coming on here is majority of the time we see owners that are in integrity, you know, like they are well‑meaning and like, oftentimes—and some of you have been to walk throughs—you go to the walkthrough and the owner's just telling you literally everything about the business. They're not trying to hide anything, but they just maybe didn't stay on top of the financials or they don't know how to do right revenue recognition or, um, you know, they know that they need to pay the bills every month, but they don't necessarily know what working capital means and those sorts of things. So it's not necessarily a deal breaker as long as they're still forthcoming and working with you and operating out of integrity. You can work through some of those things.

So, to that effect, when it comes to the financials, like, say, for example, we have someone on the call right now that only has access to tax returns. How do you feel about small businesses that like, you know, they're like, “I don't have a P&L, but I've done tax returns” and that sort of thing. Like, what do you think about those types of situations?

[00:45:00]
Chris: Yeah, I mean, it depends on the deal, right? So, like, we've done deals where you only have tax returns that we recreated the financials—we took the bank statements, we tie everything out and, um, yeah, I, I think that it's—it's tough to buy a business only off of tax returns unless it's like a tuck‑in or something. Like if it's your first acquisition and you're doing, you're putting a lot of money on the line—like a lot of your net worth on the line—to do it, and that's all they're giving you. Um, I think that that is definitely risky without good diligence too. Like you cannot do the legwork for the seller, um, which—you might do the legwork and then find out, oh, this business stinks. Um, I have a client that he has a thesis that he wants to buy those businesses because they trade at a lower price because no one wants to touch them because there's no information. I talked about black holes, right? Sometimes there's information black holes. So there's a lot of black holes with that type of business, which increases the risk of the deal. Um, if you're willing to do the legwork and figure out what's actually going on in that business, you might be the one that gets the benefit because you found the diamond in the rough. Um, but a lot of times what you find when you dig is more crap. So, yeah.

[00:47:00]
Athena: So in, in that situation then, okay, so you could then potentially pay less for the business because this owner is going to struggle to sell it to anyone else without having financials outside of tax returns. So that is a potential upside of, you know, say these off market deals. Yeah. And/or you can have the financials rebuilt with someone like yourself and—correct me if I'm wrong—but that's something that the seller could share in the expense or do themselves to try to increase their purchase price value and then give the buyer some confidence.

Chris: Yeah, it's, it's possible you can have a seller do it. I mean, I had a deal later last fall that they had a—horrible, like absolutely horrible—financials, [but] they were trying to represent 3 million in EBITDA on their business. Um, and we ended up getting halfway through and saying like, this is so messy that you need to like pay to do a full cleanup. Um, and so they're actually working on a full cleanup right now as the seller of that business. Um, not a lot of sellers—if they haven't cared to that point—a lot of them aren't going to care now, and they're not going to shell out the, you know, potentially tens of thousands to get their books cleaned up for a long enough period to get it funded by an SBA. Um, but, you know, anything's possible.

[00:48:00]
Athena: Yeah. So, but it is a—it is a—it's not necessarily a deal breaker, so long as you make sure somebody does the diligence and rebuilds it. And then you can actually, like, tie back everything to bank statements and prove it. And that's something that someone like yourself can do. So then as a buyer, you can make a decision of is this business good enough for me to shoulder that expense? Maybe I want to negotiate with the seller that they share that expense with me, or I tell them like, “Hey, this is an extra expense that I am incurring. So I'm going to pay you less money as a business unless you want to go and do it yourself. And in which case, if it does actually look the way that it does, I'll pay you more money,” right? Because I have that confidence and it's going to be easier for me to buy your business. So there's different avenues here. I guess what I'm trying to help the folks on the call understand is like, it's not a no. There's different ways you can go about it. There's different expenses, as long as you make sure that if you're buying a business, you have someone like Chris doing substantial due diligence so that what you're purchasing is what the seller is representing.

[00:49:00]
Chris: Yeah, that's a good summary. Cool.

Athena: So, um, the—just to, uh—you, you touched on cash versus accrual. I think most people understand the difference, but do you mind just giving a 101 on the difference between cash and accrual accounting and how that impacts either, you know, purchase price or due diligence or what folks here should be paying attention to that you see often ends up being a problem as part of this process.

[00:49:30]
Chris: Yeah, yeah. So cash accounting means that when I've received the cash—the person that has paid me—then I'm going to book it as revenue on my books. Accrual accounting means that when I've earned that revenue, that's when I book it. Um, something I've been dealing with recently, that sometimes people get tripped up with—and this is, I definitely got tripped up with in this particular deal—is that accrual doesn't necessarily mean when you invoice because you might not invoice at the right time. Um, for example, if I send out an invoice today for a project that I'm doing, um, but I haven't done any of the work on that project—I haven't earned any of that revenue; I haven't accrued any expenses against that project—um, then you're going to have those issues with gross margin looking really weird month to month.

So in those cases, you know, if you look on their balance sheet, you should see things like, uh, costs in excess of billings and billings in excess of costs where they're doing this percent‑completion calculation. So I guess just to summarize: cash is when I've received the money—cash, cash, that's cash accounting—and then accrual accounting is when I've earned that money. And the quick kind of gut‑check way to see that is, do I see these large swings month to month in these, these gross margins?

[00:51:00]
Athena: Also, because we worked on some deals together and there were differences in, like, the P&Ls that they were presenting or a different accounting system and what was on the tax returns and that sort of thing. So, like, what should folks be looking out for before they get to you to make sure that, you know, they understand those things? Is it a big deal? What should they be paying attention to?

Chris: Yeah, well, most small business owners are doing cash accounting on their tax returns. Um, and they might have a pseudo‑accrual basis on their bookkeeping records. That's, that's pretty common. Um, you can usually ask for both from the sell side. Ask them to run their financials on an accrual basis or on a cash basis, or if you're savvy enough, if you can just get the accrual financials with the balance sheet and do your own calculation to get to cash. Um, but that is pretty common that you'll see the tax return won't match the bookkeeping because the books are gonna be run on a—either full accrual or like they're kind of doing a mix of accrual and cash. Um, and then the, uh, the tax returns are most commonly—in, uh, most frequently—in small business, cash.

[00:52:00]
Athena: Great. So if you see discrepancies between the books and the tax returns, it's not necessarily a deal breaker. It's just possibly different accounting systems, in which case that'll all get tied up as part of the QoE.

Chris: Yeah. Yeah. And if you're—if they're—if they're doing it well, um, and if you're savvy enough, you can look at the tax return and they should bridge the two. A good tax accountant will bridge the books to the taxes and it's beyond Schedule K and Schedule M‑1. You can review those and see how the two bridge together. Um, yeah, but not all the time are they doing that properly. Uh, but in theory, they should tie the two together.

[00:53:00]
Athena: Right. But again, it's not, not deal breaker. It's just like, you know, hopefully there's a way to tie it up. If not, it will get tied up as part of due diligence. Um, so Chris has, uh, agreed to stay on a little bit later y'all. So if you have questions, start raising your hands. I'm going to touch on the question that Jason asked kind of early on. You talked about integrations post close and he was asking for you to clarify what you meant for that.

Chris: Oh, yeah. So, uh, I'd say the easiest example of that is a lot of times we're dealing with a small business owner that maybe they're on QuickBooks Desktop and it's like an old version of Desktop and maybe they have really bad processes around doing accrual accounting and everything's cash basis. Um, and they don't do—you know, they were really, you know, they have the fax machine and they're writing manual checks and they have stacks of paper in the office. Um, we'll learn a lot of those things about their accounting processes through the quality of earnings and we've taken 60, 70 clients through the process of buying the business and then transitioning them to more modern accounting systems. So, uh, doing that process of integration post closing, uh, to set up better accounting processes, more modern accounting processes.

[00:54:00]
Athena: Well, did that answer your question, Jason.

Jason: Awesome. I'm seeing yes. Great. Cool. Andrew, you've got your hands up. What questions do you have for Chris?

Andrew: Yeah. Hey, thanks, Chris, for everything you've said so far. Um, for us non, uh, finance people, it's very helpful. Um, and you might have already answered this. I think you actually have. I just want to make sure to clarify—in the event that we're getting some preliminary data, you know, basics, tax returns, things of that nature—we can't necessarily see when those, uh, you know, if it's—I'm assuming a project‑based business here—and is the quickest way to determine, you know, not untruthfulness—you know, the consistency—is, are you looking to gross margins? Is that the telltale or is there any other telltale that we can see? Hey, they've clearly booked a ton of stuff in this year and it's totally inflated their figures that they're presenting here. Just kind of in regard to that pre‑LOI phase where we can kind of at least have a preparation in mind for, you know, when we're going to have to kind of go to war there.

[00:55:00]
Chris: Yeah, yeah, no, that—that's a really great way to spot check it really quick. Like, even if you just have annual financials and you see, you know, one year it was 30 percent and then it was up to 40 percent margin, you'd see big swings. But it gets really obvious when you look at it monthly because if they spend all their money in one month, you might have—like I see all the time—there'll be negative margin months, which makes no sense, right? You're not going to bid a project for, um, and then you're going to spend a hundred thousand dollars more than you're going to get paid on it. So that just—it makes it—really sticks out like a sore thumb when you look at it monthly. It usually smooths out a little bit better on a trailing 12‑month period. And in some cases it actually won't be an issue if you grab the right TTM period. That deal that I was talking about that I was actually referencing earlier—that I was actually talking to the buyer today—where they had been looking at a year‑to‑date figure that was wildly skewed, but if they looked at a trailing 12‑month figure, the trailing 12 months actually captured all the ups and downs. So when you looked at the full trailing 12‑month, it actually came pretty close to reality. But if you're only looking at one month or just a couple months, you might be missing this big, um, you know, this big expense or a lot of revenue or something like that.

Another way to think about it—and I had a deal actually, it's the same one that I flashed on the screen earlier—they had an issue with, um, expense recognition. So they had their insurance costs every year that they booked all of it—they paid it all at once, right? Well, that's pretty common. Insurance you might pay for your entire premium at once. Well, if you look at the financials on maybe just a year‑to‑date and it's through November, but they always pay their insurance in December. Well, you're missing—maybe their insurance premium is 50 grand or a hundred grand—you're missing a ton of expense. But if you grab the trailing 12‑month period, you're going to bring that in and the monthly might look wrong because you really should be, you know, on GAAP accounting, you should be amortizing that monthly, that expense. But, um, at least at the total level, it looks right. So, uh, I don't know if that answered your question. I kind of went on a tangent, but those are some ways that you can start viewing that and making sure that you're, uh, you're not missing—like if you just see these large swings in the percentage of revenue and expenses, uh, it probably means they're doing something wrong.

I guess one more point on that is that let's say a business has really consistent revenue—and this is gonna be a hard one to visualize—but if a business has really consistent revenue and they always recognize revenue improperly—like let's say I always recognize revenue on the day the project is created, um, when I should probably be recognizing it as the project is done—but I always do it improperly. My revenue is really consistent, then there's actually not going to be a change to EBITDA. If you make the change, you're going to move the revenue out of one month and then move it into another month, but then that revenue from that one is going to move to the next one. So it actually smooths out when you correct for it. So, um, yeah, I don't, I don't know where I'm going with that. But just like, sometimes it's not an issue, I guess. But you want to make sure if you're seeing these large swings that you're digging into it and understanding it there. Does that help at all?

[00:58:50]
Andrew: Well, no, it totally does. And like you spoke to earlier, so often—I mean, everybody on this call could attest to it—miraculously, the past year has been the most profitable year of the entire company's history. And you know, uh, obviously that throws up a red flag for anybody. And again, for those of us that are not as financially savvy, looking for some of those telltale things to either, you know, either justify it or to call it out would be helpful, you know, just so we can have a better idea of what we're really trying to get to the bottom of. So that's great. Thank you very much, Chris.

Chris: You bet. And I just want—like, you can have that conversation too. Like, we always have it in the QoE management interviews. Like, ask them—like, just ask their process. And if you're not super familiar with, you know, finance and accounting, maybe it won't totally make sense to you, but as you get familiar with deals, you might start to be able to sniff these things out. Like, just ask them, “Can you explain to me your invoicing process?” And that's like—it's not a hard question. That's a two‑minute answer for them, but they'll tell you, “Oh, we get a job. We bill 30%. Uh, we calculate how far we are in the job and we send a bill every week until the job's done.” It's like, okay, well, it sounds like you're doing it pretty well. Or, “Oh, we get a job, we bill a hundred percent upfront and then we start work in three months.” You know, then it probably means that something's not being done. So—

[01:00:00]
Ryan: I have kind of piggyback actually on Andrew's question. Um, so a lot of the—a lot of the deals that everyone's looking at is competitive and so, like, there's, there's this balance of building a relationship, getting enough information to submit an LOI. And then a lot of the financials that are provided by brokers, or let's say it's an off market, they have, um, tax returns, something like that. They're annualized. And so how often is it that when someone comes to you, let's say, works—you know, it gets accepted and then they come to you—how often are you, are you building the monthly to identify some of this volatility in the margins and seasonality—that chart you showed—or is that something that you recommend that a buyer do beforehand, is push for those monthly? Love to get your feedback there.

[01:01:00]
Chris: Yeah, um, I've had before, like, the sell side say things like, “We don't have monthly financials.” They do. They have monthly financials. Um, there's always some way to get to monthly. It might not be super pretty, but like, you can get the monthly financials. Um, I definitely recommend—yeah, go—like, you get under LOI, like, pre‑LOI, they're probably not going to give you monthly financials. Maybe they do—like, it happens. Um, a lot of times you're probably not going to get it pre‑LOI. But if you do get under LOI, you know, everything should be yours. We always ask for access to their accounting system. When I'm doing the QoE, I want full access to their system. There are some cases where we don't get it and it could be okay and we'll have them download everything to Excel, but it makes the deal process easier—uh, makes like our information collection like 10 times faster—to get direct access to their systems. And yeah, you can certainly ask for that as the buyer before you start hiring people—get access to those things, look at them yourself, get familiar with it and, uh, and gut check it before you start paying people.

[01:02:30]
Ryan: That's helpful because there are a lot of people that say that we don't have them, right? But obviously then you're identifying you do. I just got to pull it out of you. Okay. That's great. Thank you.

Athena: You built on what Ryan was talking about—something that we didn't exactly touch on is, you know, immediately after—I'd say 100 percent of the people here are going to be using SBA lending. So typically what we say is, like, go see if you can get some lenders to sign this off before you order a QoE. So what—what do you think is like post‑LOI, you know, the most important financials that you should start collecting and like, when is the best time to start engaging with someone like yourself, like, to cover off some of these deal breakers—like not being able to get lending on a deal or something like that—before they order a QoE and start incurring costs.

[01:03:30]
Chris: Yeah, I mean, I'd say we're typically engaged pretty quickly after LOI is when we get engaged. Um, you know, some people will do a little bit of their own legwork. The majority of our clients, I'd say within a week or so, if not right after LOI, we kick off. Um, definitely having your whole deal team built out—lender has sniffed the deal. I would argue that even pre‑LOI a lender should have, um, you know, at least taken a glance at your LOI. Lenders get inundated with tire kickers all the time, so they might not deep dive into your deal if you're not on a signed LOI. And like, if you're sending them every CIM that kind of piques your interest, you know, they might start ignoring your emails to look at other LOIs. Um, but as long as you're like really serious about a deal and you can prove you're a serious buyer, you're organized, um, you can get, you know, your deal team ready when you're shooting them deals to look at. Uh, and you can even, you know, spend a little bit of money too. Like you don't have to spend—you know, like you spend an hour of someone's time, an hour of someone's time to preflight the deal before you start. Uh, we do some of that for clients where if someone comes to us pre‑LOI, they have data, they want to gut check things—we just charge 500 bucks to do all the pre‑LOI work. And then if they decide they want to move forward with the deal and end up doing QoE, we'll credit those costs to the full QoE.

[01:05:00]
Athena: That's fantastic. I didn't know that you did that. So I think that's a huge resource. One of the problems that some of the clients have run into is that, you know, lenders love us, love our clients. So when they bring a deal to a lender, sometimes they're going deep to get a commitment letter versus just sniffing it. So then they end up holding up the process because they're, they're asking for things that should be done after offer. So the lenders are kind of struggling to discern, you know, what point do they start diving deep. And also my train of thought—and please correct me if I'm wrong, because you've done a fair bit of these—but if they can't get a commitment letter, then ordering a QoE at that point seems futile. So, um, how many folks have, you know, engaged you and then not been able to secure financing?

[01:06:00]
Chris: Yeah, I would say—well, yeah, securing—I don't know exactly how much, I mean, who haven't been able to secure financing necessarily, but I'd say maybe 60 to 70 percent of the deals we work on end up closing. The rest die for either one reason or another. Yeah, so maybe once you get to QoE, you know, 60 to 70 percent. Um, and QoE is usually the most likely diligence stream to kill the deal. That's why usually financial diligence is the first paid work stream that comes in, and then maybe once you're halfway through that, you can start kicking off legal.

Athena: Yeah, but that's why we like to have lenders look at it before QoE, because if there's a legitimate, like, no—they're like absolutely under no circumstance could we fund this deal—then you're saving yourself the expense of a QoE on a deal that wouldn't have been able to get financed in the first place.

[01:06:50]
Chris: Yeah, and something important—something that's important there is, um, different lenders have different appetites, right? So there's some deals that one lender won't touch and another would love. Um, so just cause you took it to one lender and they're like, “This deal is not for me,” doesn't necessarily mean it's a bad deal. Um, yeah, so I just make sure you understand like, what does this particular lender like to lend on? Uh, and the other big thing is, can they actually get deals done? Uh, I've seen some clients go with lenders that maybe aren't doing a ton of SBA volume. Um, and you, you don't want to be the one that's left at the altar by your bank. You're trying to close and they're kicking things down the road forever. So, yeah.

[01:07:30]
Athena: Agree there, so we like preferred lenders here that have a lot of volume and, you know, typically what we talk about is, like, post LOI, see if you can get 2 to 3 term sheets from different lenders. So you can have an idea of who you want to work with once you get to underwriting and engaging someone like yourself. Jason just had a question. Is a QoE a set price or is it dependent on deal size?

[01:07:50]
Chris: Uh, it depends on the size and complexity of the deal. Um, so we do a flat fee, uh, but we kind of change it depending on the, uh, deal complexity. So like a carve‑out is always more complicated. Um, or there are more complicated industries that we charge more for. Uh, smaller deals are cheaper, bigger deals are more expensive. I mean, just to kind of give like ballpark—average SBA‑sized deal is around $15K for a QoE. Um, you know, we did a small landscaping deal recently that was like $10K. We did a $20 million GovCon deal recently that was $25K. So it can range pretty, pretty dramatically. Um, but yeah, it would be deal dependent.

[01:08:30]
Athena: Great. And then how much of that is up front versus at close?

Chris: We do a half up front and half when our report's delivered.

Athena: Great. And then that would be all wrapped up in the loan and—

[01:09:00]
Chris: Yeah, generally you can work with your lender—generally you can work with your lender and, uh, have that—you want to ask your lender, it's a good thing, that's another thing I'd be talking about. Do they allow for a QoE to be included as part of your down payment? Like your 5 percent towards the total deal cost or your 10 percent or your whatever you're putting down. Um, yeah.

Athena: Great. Cool. I love the pre‑LOI sniff. Do you want to talk just a little bit more about that? Like when is a good use of doing something like that?

[01:09:30]
Chris: Um—like hiring us for helping?

Athena: You said like a sniff test to, like, pre‑LOI on the financials.

Chris: The most common thing we're getting questions on is working capital. That's usually what—we're like—that's the biggest question I get, and it makes sense. That's the thing that kills more deals than anything else. Um, sometimes when there's add‑backs that people aren't super comfortable with—like, what would this be about? Um, we get questions, uh, just different things in the financials that are coming up that they're seeing that they have questions on. Um, anytime just someone feels uncertain about it when you're new to doing the deals and want a second set of eyes on it—uh, it'd be a helpful process to do.

[01:10:00]
Athena: Um, does anyone else have any questions? Chris, this has been super awesome, really illuminating. And I think kind of—

Jason: I mean, I have questions about—oh, well, sorry to interrupt, but yeah, you are—

Athena: Jason, go. Yeah, go for it.

Jason: I had a questions about the working capital. So this is, you know, I'm kind of in this pre‑LOI phase right now. Um, and you know, it's off market deal. And I had a great conversation with the seller yesterday in person. And, uh, yeah, definitely found out the reason why he wants to sell—you know, he wants to get closer to his family. So he wants to sell the business so he could buy a house, be closer to his kids and his grandkids. Um, but, um, we're about, you know, 20 to 25 percent off a purchase price. And part of the problem too is he basically wants all the cash in the—

[01:11:00]
Chris: Well, generally that's true. So it would be cash free, debt free. Most deals are cash free, debt free. So they keep all the cash. The working capital usually would—in an M&A transaction—you're going to take out, um, all cash, debt, and debt‑like items. And so you're, you know, bare bones—there might be some others depending on the deal—but you're gonna be looking at like accounts receivable, accounts payable, inventory are like kind of the main meat and potatoes that are going to be in there. It might be other items—prepaids and, um, costs in excess of billings and billings in excess of costs can be in there too, maybe payroll liabilities. Um, but the main ones would be AR, AP, and inventory. So generally cash—because right, your cash balance, right? I might keep a million bucks in my business at all times just because—actually I worked on a deal where, uh, that's—

Jason: Essentially what he has. So yeah, I worked—

Chris: Yeah, definitely. Like I worked with a deal. It was a $2 million revenue business. The business owner kept $2.5 million in cash on their books all the time. So, um, right, you come in as a buyer. It's, it's hard to say, “Oh, your average working capital balance and your cash is $2.5 million—I want, you know, want to take that,” right? Cause then you're punishing them just for, you know, like an optional thing.

[01:12:00]
Jason: But that also includes like working capital. So we've been talking about, you know, what it takes to run the business. So, you know, that money that is in that account as well, he's saying, you know, he's taking that as well.

Chris: Like the AR or just the cash? Cause the cash—generally the seller keeps all of it.

Jason: Uh, so this is where my ignorance comes in. It's just the capital to run the business from day to day. So like labor and rent and, you know, utilities, stuff like that.

Athena: Yes. So do you want to do like a basic rundown of what actual, like, accounts receivable, accounts payable—like how working capital is determined—if you have a moment?

[01:13:00]
Chris: Yeah. Yeah. So working capital—kind of going back to that, um, kind of visualization of it's the hole between when you pay for things and when you get paid for things—the amount of money that's needed in the business to, to, uh, fund operations. Now, if I own a business and I have accounts receivable coming in—let's say it takes me 60 days on average to get paid as a business owner, right? That's my terms in commercial contracts, takes me 60 days to get paid. If I buy the business today with no accounts receivable, I will have zero inflows into my business until day 60, right? That would stink. But if I bought that business and I got to keep all of the accounts receivable that the seller had built up, there's gonna be invoices that are 60 days old, 59 days old, 58 days old, 57, right? So there's gonna be all those invoices there. If I buy this business and I have that accounts receivable included—that's the working capital—then on day two, like, money's going to be coming in as I own that business. And that's, that's the funds that I have available to maintain operations. Um, does that make sense? Like that's your working capital. It's not necessarily—it can be cash. There are some cases where, like, I calculate, you know, it's 300 grand working capital is the right figure. So you can keep all the AR—just want you to give me 300K in cash. Like that, that can happen. It's atypical, but it does happen. Um, does that help?

[01:15:00]
Jason: Yeah, that helps a little bit. So, but what if he wants to take the accounts receivable?

Chris: Yeah. So that, that's where, um, you're effectively increasing purchase price if you're not including a normalized level of those accounts receivable and AP and all the other, um, items in the deal. So you can let him keep it all if you just find that, hey, it's going to be too annoying to deal with this and negotiate it. You can say, “Seller, okay, you keep it all, but you have to adjust purchase price accordingly,” because that—that's a part of the deal. Like, included in enterprise value is the working capital needed to fund operations. And so if you're going to leave out a key asset that's being purchased, then purchase price needs to come down by that—you know, a dollar figure that equals what that normalized level of working capital is. Um, so what you can do—I’d say about 30 percent of the deals that I work on the buyer does this—figure out what that working capital number is that you want and figure out what you would have bought the business for with the working capital. And then just subtract that figure and then go to your bank and make sure they're going to be able to allow you to borrow that amount that you would need to fund operations.

[01:16:00]
Ryan: And maybe, maybe, uh, sometimes it's just a little bit—these 30 percent of these sellers who are against that—it could be that they're just having a hard time understanding the concept. Right? And so one of the things is that when you're paying a business a multiple, you're paying for projections into the future. So, I think there's different ways to maybe convey to a seller why it's important that working capital is included because a lot of times where they're coming from is that, “I performed this work, not you, so I need the—I want the money.” Right? So what do you think is the best way—one of the ways I've used before is that, well, the 3 to 4 X multiple that you're getting paid for the future is for the work today into the future. And so that includes those accounts receivable. What's the best way you do, Chris, to kind of convey that message to the seller in a way that they want to sell, but they're just unaware of how important that is to the buyer.

[01:17:00]
Chris: Yeah, and that's—that's where a lot of times I find like, if it's the buyer explaining it to the seller, it can get really difficult. Because—

Jason: This is my biggest concern.

Chris: Yeah, you're not on their team.

Athena: So just to put a pin in this one—Jason, my plan was for us to—like, you're not, you're not in a—we need to circle back and actually get back into the relationship stuff and some educational stuff with the seller because we kind of skipped some steps because it's off market. So, um, let's, let's get to that. And then after you've, you've had the next step, and I'm going to bring up the spreadsheet and kind of show you those sorts of things and talk through the tactics, but we're in more of a negotiation rather than education. Re‑education or educating for the first time if we haven't gotten there—before we get to something like what Chris is talking about, where we do reports and actually show them the numbers and that sort of thing. So regardless, you have to account for it in a deal and I'll show you what that looks like and then we'll talk about some tactics for how you can explain that to the seller so he starts to get the concept of why he needs to be considering that before we start negotiating actual numbers.

[01:18:00]
Athena: So, um, on that note, I don't want to keep Chris too much longer, but like, non specific, uh, any other questions about what Chris talked about? And then Jason will dive into your deal and give you specific feedback on, on the situation that you're in right now.

Andrew: Really—just really quick, Athena, I've got—it's probably on your old website, Chris—but you mentioned some, you know, post close, like fractional CFO, things of that nature. Do you have some more, um, information on that on your guys's website?

[01:18:40]
Chris: Definitely. Um, so yeah, post close the least we'll do for our client is we want to do the books and taxes. So we're working with you year‑round to make sure you got actual financials and got good tax planning throughout the year. Um, we can scale that up. We can help with payroll and bill pay and, um, fractional CFO and advisory work too if, uh, if needed. So yeah, happy to—happy to—website should have a lot of info, but if you ever have questions on it, feel free to reach out too.

Andrew: Ten four. Thanks for your help, Chris. This is great.

[01:19:20]
Athena: Yeah, good. Um, we'll drop Chris's details in the channel. We'll post the video again, so y'all can watch this. Um, Chris is awesome. Worked on a few clients—clients worked on a few deals with him—and just amazing feedback and really great to work with. So, um, yeah, so appreciate you taking the time to break that all down. I think we've talked about actually bringing you back to deep dive into some of these other conversations, like working capital and financials and stuff like that, if you're open to it, but really appreciate your time and expertise. I'm sure you'll be hearing from a lot of the folks here as they move closer to, uh, you know, getting these deals closed. Thank you so much.

Chris: Yeah, absolutely. It was great—great being here and happy to come back anytime.

[01:20:00]
Athena: Awesome. Well, thank you so much. And for those of you that want to hang out and hear Jason's, uh, uh, situation right now with an off market and how we can negotiate, get that back on side, please stick around. But, uh, Chris, thank you so much. Um, feel free to hang out if you want. Otherwise we'll, uh, bid you adieu.

Chris: All right. Thank you. Thank you guys. Great meeting you and, uh, see you soon.

Athena: Awesome. Thanks, Chris.
