[00:01:00]
Polly: I thought he was great. I really did. You know, as far as like picking out one specific thing, I mean, it really resonated with me, his emphasis on customer service. And of course that's always been near and dear to my heart. I don’t know, I thought his whole presentation was good. I cannot give you one very specific thing. I thought the customer service thing was very interesting. I think that the, you know, the type of coaching that he does is, you know, it makes me wanna ask him like even more questions after watching the presentation because while you're watching it, you're trying to pay attention and you don't wanna be distracted by some of the things that maybe I wished I would’ve asked, but didn’t really think about until after I was off.

I mean, I think some of the questions that you were asking him were really great as far as just like staffing and ways about going to find people. I was paying attention. I can’t give you a very specific thing that stood out, but I thought all of it was great. You always have really good people on there anyway, so I learn a lot and I try to be as observant as possible. Just because I’m not asking questions doesn’t mean that I’m not paying attention. It’s just trying to take it all in.

Athena: Yeah, no, I hear you. Steve, I just saw you join. Did you have any thoughts or observations or takeaways from John's talk last week?

Steve: No, I thought he was great. I can't remember the example of that, but I think we referenced him the next day when Polly and I were doing something totally unrelated to this. Very, very well thought out.

Polly: Sorry, we used something regarding being a coach instead of a consultant. That’s what we used, you and I were talking about.

Steve: Yeah, the whole difference between a coach and a consultant, and some of those concepts and kind of walking in. I thought he was real good. Always learned something.

Athena: Yeah. So for Justin and Gil, to give you a little FOMO to go back to it when you're closer to ownership, John wrote one of the books that's actually on my bookshelf, even though I'm the book lady and I read a million books. He kind of reminds me of like even pre-Traction, right? Like he has been both owning a business, doing it remotely before it was even a thing, and then helping other business owners for so long. It was really interesting to hear him say things that I was like, oh, I've heard Leila Hormozi say that, or, oh, I've heard that. You know, I feel like these are the people that have these original thoughts sometimes or just have been giving this kind of advice, and then it trickles down into the newer people that we're listening to.

John also does—oh my gosh, I can't remember the name, it’s a really clever name—but basically coaching for new owners of businesses when they acquire a business. How to actually go through that process of taking it over and becoming an owner, looking at the why, and how to systematize things and how to focus on outputs rather than just kind of like, ah, what do I do and where do I do it? He offered everybody a free coaching session also. I know Peter was actually in the middle of reading his book when I announced him, and Peter's already followed up with him being a current business owner.

It’s really good to start thinking about this close to ownership. If you wanna hire a specialized person—and we were talking about hiring and recruiting and what do you look for and what are those kinds of qualities—he has a ton of really good experience and information. I think what's really cool about him is he was one of the presidents of the International Coaching Federation, ICF, so that's pretty much the biggest body of coaches. Tons of knowledge and experience there.

What's good for me when I listen to folks like that is just getting confirmation, you know? Sometimes you hear things and it might be the new thing or the thing on the internet, but when you hear confirmation or direction from somebody that’s been doing this sort of thing for as long as he has, that also feels good. He’s very well respected in these circles, too. Does anybody remember—EDA or anyone—the name of his transition support coaching? Anyways, Steve, I saw your hand raised.

[00:03:00]
Steve: Yeah. It’s coming back to me. Sorry—my first call this morning was a presentation at 4:00 AM, so it was an early start today. It kind of felt like The E-Myth for small businesses, and you talk about the confirmation that, hey, this is simple, but it's not easy. He walked through a couple of different scenarios, but he was very much on delegation and process. I like to use the word playbooks, but basically walking in and systemizing everything. Kind of just observing and understanding what are you working with today, where’s the lack of systems? He talked to a bunch of stories on all the disasters that can happen along the way, too, but really kind of then trying to get yourself out of the business of being the operator into somebody running the business through systems and processes.

I remember when he was speaking, the old E-Myth started really kicking in—really around systems. And I can't remember who he gave this exact example—maybe he did—but like, McDonald's does not have the best hamburger out there, but man, they have the best systems out there. So that type of concept. He really drilled in on: when you walk in, it's gonna be a mess. You gotta figure out the systems, then you gotta figure out the right people to run the systems. That was my big takeaway.

Athena: Well, yeah, because he was saying the CEO—you’re like a conductor, right? The conductor comes out at a symphony concert and they get applause even though they're not playing an instrument. I liked that analogy of being a true owner that's not in the day-to-day necessarily, and you're kind of the conductor of the business. I’m just pulling up my notes. I got this wrong when he asked the question and he said, what's the one valid business reason? What's the one reason a business exists? Does anyone remember what that was?

Polly: No. Repeat the question one more time. What—what—

Athena: What's the purpose of a business? What's the one valid business reason to exist as a business? It was to create a customer.

Polly: To create a customer. Yes.

Athena: Yeah, and I was like, oh—you know, I thought it was like to create a service or whatever. But I liked that thought too. The business doesn't exist if you're not creating customers. So how do you create customers and create a product that they like, deliver a good service? All of the things wrapped up in that. I thought that was a pretty cool one that I took away.

Also, something that I've started implementing myself—although I’m reminding myself I’m not being as good about it as I should be—was he talked about keeping a CEO notebook. So every day kind of writing down, what did you learn? What came up today? Where were you confused and how did you solve it? As you go through this journey, often you don't realize like, what day did I actually figure that out, or what were my learnings on that?

I think you all could actually start implementing now, like going through the buying journey too. You're drinking through a fire hose when you're going through M&A and it's like, what did I learn today either about a business characteristic or about the process, or where was I confused, where can I get clarity? Just kind of keeping that journal of your progression. Or like, if you're like, I remember going through this situation before—going back to my notes. I've started keeping a CEO notebook for the business, but I thought it could be cool for your M&A journey as well to just keep top-line notes on the things that happened. Or if you're a journaler, spending more time writing. Yeah, Steve.

[00:10:00]
Steve: Yeah, no—just, totally unrelated, but I did my three and a half hours or four hours of binge YouTube listening on the way back. You guys probably know the person I'm gonna bring up. I'm not super familiar with—like, personalities don't mean much to me, I just try to learn stuff—but there's a guy, he's an investor, founder of a bunch of businesses, Dan Martell. Yeah. So, I was binge listening to Dan Martell and he was talking about: if you do something twice, make a checklist. All about templates. It kind of really—yeah, Buy Back Your Time—but it kind of really is very similar to John's take on the world, too. That’s what I was thinking on the way back. But that concept of you do it twice—he goes down to like packing a business trip. He's got a checklist sitting there. Just so you know, I got the template, I can pack in 10 minutes and go. Just, you know, same concept, I think—but affirmation or confirmation that the folks at that level, that's what they do.

Athena: This book is hands down one of the most impactful books I've read in my business journey. So I think everybody's heard of Who Not How by now. When we're in school, we're taught to figure out how do I do this myself, right? You're not allowed to cheat and work with anybody else. You have to figure it out independently. So we're just trained our whole lives to have to figure everything out ourselves. Then Who Not How is like, how do I find a person to solve this that knows how to solve this rather than me figuring it out myself? But I loved the concept and I did nothing with it for years. I'm like, yeah, Who Not How, that's a great concept, but how do you actually do it?

This book is the how-to of Who Not How. He breaks down frameworks, systems, processes—everything. And it's basically how to not only pay someone to do things for you, but how do you decide what to do, in what order—what frameworks do you use? He's got a hiring process. We've actually implemented a lot of the components from his hiring process into our own hiring process. With the video cover letter—he's like, only 20% of people will do it and then you can get a good read on them in three minutes rather than trying to schedule a call and doing all the things. And he's right. You don't have to sift through thousands of applications because when you ask them to do a video, only 20% of 'em will actually go the extra step to do a video for you to apply for a role. It's absolute gold.

So it's something that I recommend—and I send it out when you become a new business owner, too—because he actually has a framework for the replacement ladder of how do you replace yourself in the business. And he's like, every business that I buy, I also do this for whatever the owner was doing. He has a systematic order for how you delegate certain things in the business out to other people—like in what order. So it starts with the admin, then it's the delivery, then it's the marketing, then it's the sales, then it's leadership/strategy. If we're all thinking of how do we go from maybe the owner was super involved and spending 60 hours a week, but how do you actually decide what things you delegate in what order to get to that coveted passive owner status? So yeah, I will rant all day long about Buy Back Your Time and Dan Martell. I actually sent it to Will from Acquiring Minds too. I was like, dude, why are you answering your own emails right now? This is crazy.

Polly: He is—Dan Martell—we were watching him one night on YouTube and he had a couple of really great videos on AI and how he uses AI. He's a great presenter. He's a very captivating guy, so he holds your attention very well. I really found that to be interesting.

Athena: Yeah, I've seen him speak a couple times. He'll—if you follow him on Instagram—he just randomly pops up in towns all the time and will do a talk and give out free books and stuff like that. Yeah, this—I'm a “tell me how to do something, I'll try your framework and then I'll figure it out” person. But a concept like Who Not How—I was like, where do you even get started? I agreed with the concept, but what do I do? So when I found this book, I was like, oh my God. It's like, okay, I'm bought into “I shouldn't be doing everything myself,” and this is how to actually do it.

Dan started investing into AI tech companies as well. He's going hard into AI, and a lot of the business minds that I listen to—I've been kind of getting obsessed with listening to all the business leaders that I follow, listening to their take on AI and what's coming and like, is it utopia? Is it dystopia? How does it layer into the economy, inflation, everything. There's no doubt that AI is definitely a really interesting space for all of us to consider, especially looking at the businesses. Fun stuff. Cool. Well, I was wondering—so Justin, I haven't heard an update from you, but I know you've got a couple live ones. Any movement on those?

[00:16:00]
Justin: I got a little. I have feedback from the roofing broker. Apparently we're gonna talk this afternoon. I'm really not sure what the feedback was—it was weird. He basically said, let me know if you're interested in pursuing this further. I think this was a templated response to prospective buyers where they were basically stating he's had a really good June, which wasn’t a part of the numbers I had when I submitted the original—through like T-12 May. He said, let us know if you want to evaluate or what you wanna do. I think the subtext, though he never actually said it in the email—they’re calling out June numbers, here's their receivables—what they were doing is like, if you wanna change your offer, basically up your offer. But he knows my offer included a caveat or component that accounted for a change in EBITDA that I was like, here's what we would do in that case. And the EBITDA change, if I'm reading his numbers correctly, are like $8,000 more than what I proposed anyway in the trailing. So I'm like, what are we talking about? Are we doing this?

Athena: Right.

Justin: So I'm gonna talk to 'em and see what that means. It's starting to get a little squishy where they don't want to commit. They keep wanting to see what each subsequent month is going to do to his business. I said, well, that's exactly why I've got the points in the LOI that accommodate what happens should the EBITDA change up or down. If we agree to the terms and we're good with that, then we can keep moving forward. Nothing is gonna fundamentally or materially change the LOI. Anyway, I'm confused.

Athena: Sounds like they're still dating then.

Justin: Could be.

Polly: Could be, yeah.

Justin: Or they're using this as a lure to see who else is in the mix. I'm getting to a point with this one where it's just like, I don't wanna keep this going forever—back and forth and back and forth. Either we have terms we're agreeing to or not. We keep dialing it in; the scope's getting more and more specific and finite with responses. I'm accommodating where I can, where it makes sense. There's a point where I'm just gonna be like, look, here's the deadline. If you want it or you don't—I'm not gonna keep this back and forth indefinitely. I've got too much else going on. But he's still friendly—everything's still very friendly. This is just kind of my internal monologue.

Athena: I would put him on the spot for next steps.

Justin: Yeah, that’s basically what I'm gonna do.

Athena: I would just say, hey, I'm a little confused. I thought we were negotiating this directly. It sounds like you're talking to other people, so what's your next move here? How are you guys deciding? When are you deciding? I kind of put my offer out to you twice now. What's the decision process look like and your timing?

Justin: I may get to a point where if they won't commit to what that is, then I may just have to pull my hat from the ring. I've got too much else to focus on. I can't keep doing this. But we'll see. It's not dead by any stretch. I don't know what the status is, but we'll find out when I talk to the broker.

Athena: I'd be like, what's missing that you're not signing right now? You've got my offer. We've been talking about that. I didn't know you were talking to other people—it sounds like you are. What's the seller holding out for right now?

Justin: Yeah.

Athena: He hasn't signed any of 'em.

Justin: My gut is probably—if my read is right—that he had that dip in the first half and he's working diligently to come out of it. He knows with these storms coming through he’s capitalizing, and that's affecting, to his benefit, the valuation or the EBITDA and therefore the valuation based on multiple. I think he's baiting and trying to buy time so that he can have this on paper to then make the business more attractive and ideally increase offers or get better offers. That's my read. Which is fine, and exactly why, again, I put that asterisk—if the EBITDA changes for the better, we'll deduct that proportionately from the seller's note, the performance component, and vice versa. Either way, I've got that written in there. So I don't know what's going on. Like I said, I'm confused.

Athena: Yeah. There's a reason he's not signing. I would—yeah, I feel a little bit messed around. What's going on? How can we button this up? What's not happening? What's missing for him? Why is he not signing it? And I would be like, I've got a couple other really great deals in play, so I need to start choosing at this point. You kind of take it away from 'em. I don't know if I would pull your hat out, because it still is a really exciting deal, but I would just be like, look, I've gotta start focusing my efforts. I would love for it to be with you guys, but I thought we were close and it doesn't sound like we are.

Justin: That's the lever I was gonna pull next: look, I've got other businesses I'm deeply evaluating. I haven't used that with them yet; I haven't mentioned that because I just didn't think it warranted it. But there will be a point where I'm gonna need to make my own decision shortly if this is going to be a part of that consideration or not.

Athena: I like what Renan said when he visited us: look, I want to buy a business. I don't know if it's your business. You could use a spin on that—I'd like it to be this business, but I've got other options and it doesn't feel like you guys are choosing me or moving forward. What's missing, and is there something we can talk about at this point? If not—before you get to that point, ask what's the decision process and the timeline, because I thought we were closer and now it feels like we're further away. What's happening?

Justin: They keep changing their own goalposts, so I don't know if they know. They had this hard deadline before—came and went. Then they had a second deadline, less formal—came and went. I don't know if they will commit to a standard at some point. I don't know.

Athena: Got it. Any movement on the financing piece or the other deal?

[00:24:00]
Justin: I haven't heard back about the SBA alternative stuff.

Athena: You mean with like Stonehenge?

Justin: I think I sent some material to Matt. He's reviewing—probably touch base this week, I'm sure. And then the other deal, the coworking space—we're back from the broker today. He has not presented it at this point to the seller, but he was reviewing it and gave me some feedback on how he thinks it'll be received, and he thinks it's gonna be low—that my offer is too aggressive, in my favor, what have you. He asked a couple points around there. I didn't hold too firm, but I made very valid points as to why it was structured the way it's structured.

Most notably, for three years running there's been decreasing revenue—systematically 15% year over year, if not closer to 20% a couple years. He said he didn't think that my multiple offer would be strong enough. I'm like, well, you can't command a premium for a declining business. I'm not gonna pay a premium multiple for a declining business. If that should change, fine. That's where I leaned into the same thing as the roofing business: the reason the performance note is in there is to get levels back to where they were 2023, not even 2022—which was the best year. 2023 was a down year; 2024 was an even further down year. If we can align incentives to get back to 2023 numbers, then we both win, and that's how I can offer a larger multiple. I just don't think they like that multiple. I think they're still trying to command a premium. I had a feeling that might be the case because this isn't a desperation sale. He's like, I'll just hold onto it if I have to, which is fine. So maybe we don't get to that point. He goes, okay, this helps—let me get feedback from the seller and I'll get back to you. That's where we are now with that.

Athena: Okay, cool. Well, look forward to diving in deeper. Anything else? You said you're chatting with the broker today on Hometown?

Justin: Yeah, we're supposed to chat today.

Athena: Oh good. I look forward—so we can catch up on that tomorrow and see where that's at.

Justin: Oh yeah. He's so busy doing his little roofing brokerage empire. He said, hey, let's talk at one. I said, hey, we good? We talk at one? He goes, no, let's talk later. He's going a million directions, but we'll see if I can actually get 'em on the line.

Athena: Cool. Awesome. Thanks, Justin. We'll check tomorrow. Gil, I think you have an interesting one—it's on-market, but the seller’s selling themselves, and it sounded like you have a call coming up. Have you thought through strategy for that one? Would it be worth talking about that one a bit?

[00:27:00]
Gil: It would be; however, I have a hard stop in like three minutes.

Athena: Oh no, that's tomorrow morning when we meet. But yeah, I have a few thoughts in my mind about what I want to ask him and how I want to approach—especially after listening to the call that Luke did with him. He sounds very laconic, very straight to the point, very one-word-answer kind of person. So I just need to approach that correctly.

Athena: Yeah. Might be some mirroring if it's directly with the seller there. Yeah, excited to talk about that. Sorry I didn't pick on you earlier then, but we can chat through it tomorrow.

Cool. Well, Steve and Polly, I know you've got some new stuff coming up, and we've closed out everything else, or is there anything else live that you're working on that would be worth chatting through?

Polly: I think really that, you know, we just decided no on the franchise and of course we went through that whole process with you on Wednesday and some times prior to that.

Steve: Yeah. Do you want to call you back or try to have another meeting?

Polly: What's that? Yeah, so I received an email from the broker—I'm bringing it up right now in my email just to make sure I read it off correctly. Casey asked if you were open to a call with him, who is the owner—wanted to see if he could get you past the franchise concerns. I know he was kind of pulling for you to throw in an offer. So that was basically Steve and I saying the offer that they received wasn't the offer he ended up liking, wanting, or the guy pulled it—or who knows. But it doesn't sound to me like there's probably anything else on the table for him right now.

Athena: Yeah, it might be worth sharing with the group and the reporting just in case anybody else considers franchises. There were some pretty material numbers that would be different for you as the owner based on what they were sharing, and they weren't including all the fees and everything. So there was a lot of detective work that y'all had to do comparing the three different locations and all of that. It doesn't sound like they have a lot, and probably because you went so far down the process they're like, wait, no, don't go. Are you still wanting to leave it alone, or is that making you want to be open to a call? How are you feeling about that?

[00:30:00]
Steve: We're done with it. Such a mess. Move on. Justin, I think you're on the call still—for your lessons learned. There are three different franchises. They had three different P&Ls. When you start lining up the expenses—it's a franchise—everything should match up. Every expense should be a line item on everything. Some places call it this, some places were different, some it was missing. How do you have a franchise store that doesn't have a franchise fee? Then you're trying to evaluate the whole picture. Basically one of the three stores was doing 75 or 80% of the revenue, but he's trying to put 'em all together. They probably had a spreadsheet all created just trying to line up what is what. I think the main store was absorbing some of the expenses from the other stores, so it made it look better on paper. We didn't even talk about some of the add-back stuff that we couldn't figure out, too.

The main store they had—he was moving only 10 minutes away, but it's the only one that's working. So now you're buying a new location. Why not just buy into the franchise and patrol location at that point? It was just such a mess. Great learning experience. I think all of us that go into this have been warned and think twice about franchises. We said, let's just play the cards out and see what happens anyway. Interesting business. Oh, and to boot, the founder—this was the founder of the franchise’s stores himself—and he doesn't have three flagship stores that are really crushing it, but he's spending more time on selling the franchises at this point. It was really one of those. Yeah, it was really good pushups to go through all the exercise of trying to figure out the financials—you get better at it—but we just kind of said, this is really too complex. And there was another offer—I think it was a doctor out of Tampa—wanted to buy it. He had an LOI that he submitted and apparently when we just turned it down, apparently that LOI wasn't really a solid LOI, or maybe there was no LOI—who knows.

Athena: I keep laughing—it's kind of like those who can't do, teach; those who can't run businesses start franchises. My mind just boggles. Also, being someone that's done licensing and franchising in the past in my businesses and for Guinness World Records, there was so much integrity with what we did and we felt like we really needed to nail it and get the model right and thriving before we started handing it over to people.

But to move the high performer 10 minutes away mid-sale—the mind boggles. It's like the unsolved mysteries—rolling in my head—why would you do that? Why is he doing that? What on earth—take this store that's holding up the other two stores and just move it 10 minutes down the road and do that in the middle of a sale?

Polly: I still come back to—it doesn't matter what kind of business you have, if you're selling a product, you want to be the face of that product. You want it to be a great product—something that you use, something that you're promoting—and you know, it can be truly mapped back to you. I could never get past the fact—why would a franchisor of all these other brands and this brand not have those three stores be his showcase stores?

Athena: Yeah. On the surface, the numbers looked good; it looked attractive. You went to the store locally and she was happy and it looked good. I liked that there were three separate P&Ls, but if you're running three separate P&Ls, you should be having the true expenses for every single store—even if one store's paying it—make sure you're mapping that over to the P&Ls of the other store. How that got missed—to not have all the true franchise fees—is part of the— I think we got there in the end that it was part of the SDE calculation, but it wasn't on the P&Ls. On the surface it looked like it could be a really interesting business, right? This is why we go through this process of really digging into the numbers and meeting the owners and even doing the location visit—you got information that you wouldn't have necessarily gotten otherwise. I think you did a good job of running this down because it was a little bit of three locations and the P&Ls, and Polly did her forensic accounting on the P&Ls. It was awesome. Well done on all that. This would go in your CEO notebook of all the things you learned.

Polly: I was just thinking about that—John's suggestion of basically journaling your business journey. This is definitely one to journal.

[00:36:00]
Steve: I think you're used to this, Athena, but for me the comedic value of dealing with some of these owners is just so interesting. We looked at that waterfront property in Destin that did all the renting out the boats, and in mid-cycle of selling it he decides, I'm gonna put a little restaurant on the property. Like, where are you coming from? You're selling your business. I'm just gonna drop a restaurant here. Or—Polly, you didn't say anything, Athena, but was it yesterday or the day before—if you remember, the catering lady who had the—she came back—

Polly: She sent me a text.

Steve: She really wants us to buy her business. This is the one who had—remember she had the Chinese landlord who she got deported and she has to drop money in an envelope—sorry—and I'm like, what in the world? But I guess that's part of a lot of these small—

Polly: It’s part of it. She said, I'm reaching out to see if you have any interest in purchasing Simple Catering. I'm open to a reasonable offer. You would not have to be present at the kitchen every day. I went there once this week for about an hour. We had nine jobs this week and it all went smoothly. Our staff is very competent and need little direction. I am in communication with them a few times a day. We communicate through emails and text. My sister Steph, who's the chef, and I are willing to work six months to implement a smooth transition. Salary's negotiable. If you would like to set a time to talk and ask questions, let me know. Thank you for considering this purchase. So she reached out to me and I responded to her really quickly and I think I was really kind about it. I just said I appreciate you reaching out to us for further consideration, but we no longer have an interest in the catering and food service category. I sincerely hope you find a buyer that is the right fit for Simple Catering. We wish you and your sister the very best. And she thanked me for my quick response and that was it.

Athena: That's sweet. But yeah, I always laugh when those things happen—like the ex that comes back. But sometimes they come back and you want 'em, right? Or situations change or the thing that was a deal breaker, they go away and work on it and then they come back to you and, hey, we fixed that thing. I've heard that time and time again of deals coming back. We actually had that with one of our early clients—two different deals ended up coming back after we lost them. I mean, shoot, even Justin thought that was lost and now you're negotiating. It sounds like you're negotiating with other people.

I was nearly in tears laughing when they told me the asking price on the three franchises. I can't remember exactly what it was, but Steve's like, should we get a clip of Athena hysterically laughing?

Steve: Here's our answer—we're just gonna send our consultant as our answer, laughing her butt off on video right now. There's like four point whatever million dollars and then you start adding it up, you're like, whoa. Anyway, whatever. That's bygones, but it's all learning experience. That's what I'm learning. There's some comedic value in it along the way, but I think we're getting better at understanding that there's gonna be something in every deal. What can you live with? Quite frankly, if we really were interested in the catering business, this could have been something that would've been great for us because now instead of them fronting that “we want this,” well, here's what we're willing to do. Now we're in our terms. It's just not the right business for multiple reasons.

Athena: Yeah. No, that's cool. Well, good stuff. I know you've got a new one that you're gonna start looking at—excited to hear about that one.

[00:41:00]
Athena: Oh—wait, wait. Let me plug Thursday. So, Elliott Holland's coming back on Thursday and I've asked him to do Financial Statements 101—balance sheets and P&Ls—and y'all were either there or watched his sessions, so he makes them really interactive. I would definitely block out your calendars and come to that one because I'm still learning about financial statements even though I've looked at so many of 'em, and he's certainly looked at so many of them doing QoE. I thought, who better than Elliott to do a really fun 101 topic on something that's a little bit of a brain melt and also not that fun of a topic normally. I would not miss that one. I think it's gonna be a lot of fun and educational—which you learn better when you're having fun, I think.

Steve: Two things—if it's in scope of the conversation or not—two things that I personally struggle with in my head are: number one is working capital, and number two is add-backs. While you have financial statements—okay, now where do we go to really make this a true statement that we can work off of from a true valuation?

Polly: Yeah, I'm gonna second that. Those actually are two ones that I would’ve brought up as well.

Justin: I'll third it. Why not?

[00:43:00]
Athena: Awesome. So we'll start with P&L and balance sheets, and then how to determine working capital's a little bit difficult with those two statements, but add-backs for sure—in terms of what's a legitimate add-back or not, or how he views add-backs. I'll give him that brief and see what he can do with that and pull out some magic. Maybe we'll just do a separate working capital discussion, because I don't think you can have enough conversations about that. We have some past Buyers Clubs recordings with Chris talking through working capital, but now that you have more deal experience it's like, oh, okay, now I can actually wrap my head around it and sink my teeth into it having had more deals to look at.

These are good topics—I have to book more Buyers Clubs. Any other topics that would be of interest or useful to you all that either we've covered in the past and you'd love to revisit or things we haven't covered yet?

[00:44:00]
Steve: I'd have to give some thought. Personally, I'm geeking out on trying to learn how to build AI agents right now.

Athena: As are we.

Steve: It's another one of those things that is simple, but not easy. The programming I did—I think the last time I actually wrote code was in 1986 or something like that. That code is like the ancient stuff—they've replaced it like 10 times over already. But the idea of taking, even on a personal basis to organize—when we look at a deal, how can we do it faster, better, and everything else? Whatever the learning process—it's coming no matter what. Either you embrace it or you're gonna be left behind. I need to understand the concept and I need to build some myself so I understand what really goes behind the design and everything else. Because when we do buy a business, the first thing I'm gonna do is say, okay, what can we do and automate through AI agents as a strategy—whether it's around marketing, content, advertising, billing, whatever. I'm just taking some stuff that doesn't matter if I blow it up; it doesn't matter. But that's kind of where I'm geeking out. So maybe a session on the future of small business and AI, how to incorporate it.

Justin: Yeah, I agree. I work in AI with my day job. We sell AI-enabled data to enterprise companies and Fortune companies. I'm in agent AI tools—not as much personally, but certainly professionally—all the time. I absolutely leverage everything I can for my own needs when possible as well. I was mulling over some ideas that have been mulling in my head around where I could bone up or get more insight.

One of them is—and I don't even know exactly how to articulate this—almost like role play scenarios and modeling based around criteria that you uncover through diligence or through the research in the diligence process. Case in point: I hear a lot of, you've gotta account for those things and make sure that's in the model. But I wanna hear people say, here's what we did to account for that and still move forward. For example, Luke has brought one of the newer opportunities—I'm speaking with the broker right after this, actually, here in a few minutes—but they have like a 90% customer concentration in one customer. That scares the bejesus outta me. That has been the number one non-starter in my book. But I'm meeting with them 'cause maybe there's something creative—I don't know what I don't know. We'll see—the nature of that relationship sounds like it is very relationship-driven, so there's a lot of flags.

What I would love to hear is scenarios where someone moved forward with the business and said, here's how we accounted for that. Here's what we did in how we structured the deal, how we worked through transition, how we diversified or whatever their solution was going to be, and how they executed that post-transition. I'm just using customer concentration as one example, but you get the idea—key man risk, the guy is the brand and he's leaving—what did you do to successfully overcome that in structuring a safeguarded deal, and then what did you do to implement in the early days post-transition?

[00:48:00]
Steve: To pile on—I'm also in big tech. We do a lot of AI—the platform is kind of built on AI—and I sell AI governance and all that good stuff. What's so interesting is there's the promise and then there's the reality. For example, even internally, our internal system where we can ask a chat to pull what I need from internal documents, I asked a real basic question and it gave a bunch of fluff back. I gotta go to ChatGPT to find out more than my own company's got on the data that's already connected. So what's reality? If you come across, Athena, anybody who is actually doing something with AI in small business, where's the low-hanging fruit? There's the art of the possible—so many things we can do—but where's the low-hanging fruit when you walk in to say, hey, you can shore up X? Practical stuff instead of all the Instagram and YouTube promise world stuff. How do we make it useful? Because, like Justin said, we're gonna take over a business and then—now what?

Even using AI to build—take what John's doing and say, okay, you gotta get these systems and playbooks down. How can we use AI—even if you're walking around with a little recorder and saying, hey, tell me how we do this stuff. Get the recording, drop it in, do some generative AI to summarize it, and then do some agent AI to rebuild the process so it never—there are so many things. But where can we go in and bam, that's a win right away?

[00:50:00]
Athena: As you're talking, I'm like, there is so much that me and the team are doing that could translate to business. We can pull out: here's the tools that we use to help us. We're a small but highly productive team, right? That's because we're very tech-forward in the background. My philosophy around it is: how do I use tech to replace the things that I don't need a specialty human for, to create a better human experience? Behind the scenes, the monotonous admin things are better served by tech—humans get tired and bored. Tech doesn't get bored and works 24 hours a day. But the interactions and the consultative part, and the intuition and the EQ—that AI is just not there. It doesn't create context; it needs context.

We use AI so many ways. I can't even count how many “Athena bots” there are now that the team have created. How would Athena respond? What's Athena say about this? A lot of our outreach is done as me, right? So, yeah, we could probably—

Steve: Do you ever consult with the Athena bot yourself?

Athena: No. Maybe I should. I should get access to it and be like, what would I do in this situation? But I just thought it was so funny because the team started building Athena bots and they would run the outputs by me. I can even do a case study for how we used AI. If you're going into a new business, how can you use AI to help your team do better and not have to run every single decision past you? I review the outputs and I'm like, okay, now I feel confident that the outputs are as good as I would want to see, and now y'all can fly off. There's a way in which we do it that I have oversight, I review it, and then I'm like, okay, I'm good with it—team can run with it.

[00:53:00]
We can also get AI experts in and the low-hanging fruit—and how would you incorporate AI at a basic level in some of these businesses that have absolutely nothing? That gives me a lot of fun topics to think about for the future, 'cause it is something that we all need to be thinking about. Between offshoring certain roles and getting exceptional talent outside of the US and AI, I think there's a lot of opportunities.

Steve: Disruption too—because the employees there are not AI people, nor will they probably ever be. How do you go in there and actually help them do more interesting things and not scare the heck out of 'em like “my job is gone”? Part of it is, yes, we'd like to make money, but we're also in that camp of we appreciate the small business community. How do you lift it up instead of shred it like a private equity would do?

Athena: These are great topic ideas. Good luck on the call, Justin. And really excited for Thursday—hope y'all can make it with Elliott. That is sure to be one not to miss.

Polly: One more thought on the AI thing—I'm just thinking about systems improving and everything—back of the house improving systems, making that customer experience better. But I also think there's an element that we're missing nowadays, especially where the human element of actually taking care of the customer—whether it's somebody offshore that you're using that person's talent for that, or you're doing it yourself, depending on how big your business is. I think back to a time when you were providing customer service to a client or to a customer and you made sure that they were taken care of completely, instead of just saying, okay, this is my box here, this is the only thing that I'm supposed to do, so I'm gonna pass you off. Improving those systems—yes. But I think there's gonna be a huge focus on the human perspective. A lot of people are just honestly really pissed off with their experiences with companies.

[00:55:00]
Athena: Oh, if you've been in my house the last couple days—my poor boyfriend trying to move his number from one service provider to another, and it's been 20 hours. He drove three hours away to a store—like all sorts of—it's just an absolute nightmare. I don't know if you've heard me say this before, but I think in addition to AI, the real valuable businesses in the future are gonna be the ones that do exceptional concierge human interactions with people.

Polly: Agreed.

Athena: And that’s how we're building this business—how do we use technology behind the scenes to enable that exceptional concierge human-level experience? So you're not dealing with AI, because I am pissed off every time I get one of 'em. I'm like, agent—human. I'm just screaming at it. I don't even wanna deal with this thing right now. But it does empower all of us to do so much more. The team’s actually building—we're calling it the Oracle right now. That's a second brain of retaining all of the client information—the industries—that sort of thing to do that first-level filtering. The humans we have are very good at it, but we'd be able to do more, faster, and probably more accurately by not having the monotonous work done by humans and having it done by something that we could train for that. Which then makes the humans happier because they're not doing monotonous, boring, brain-melting stuff.

I did everything in this business before we hired all these exceptional humans, and there's some mind-melting stuff. We can do so much more and better on that human level if we use tech to replace some of the things that I don't think humans need to do. And you would, if anything, perceive a better experience because we'll be able to improve some of those behind-the-scenes processes.

[00:58:00]
I think offshoring would be a fun topic too—definitely—because I have a lot of opinions about it on doing it well and not doing it well, where to source from and how to create a culture around it and all that sort of stuff. That could be another fun one, 'cause that can be a real game changer to help your onshore team—to get them a really exceptional offshore support system, which we have here.

Steve: Yeah, that's awesome. You can teach us how to get our—we're not offshore. The people are great. We're the problem because we don't put the systems in place and transfer what we want done. That's not an easy thing to do, so you end up just doing it yourself. I would love to hear your thoughts on that.

Athena: Yeah. We don't view—and this was something I learned kind of early on—everyone you hire is part of the company. It's not like this team is treated differently than this one. Everyone is part of the company and they're treated the same. Nobody's above anyone unless there's an actual management/reporting structure. Building that kind of culture. Also, making sure you're hiring from cultures that are all gonna get each other. I've studied this a lot in terms of other people doing things, and we won't source in certain parts of the world 'cause I don't think it's a good quality of life and that sort of thing. I have a lot to say there that we could pull in. I know somebody who's an amazing speaker on that, so maybe I can get him to come and talk too.

Cool. Awesome. Well, good stuff. I'm excited to hear more tomorrow. I know Luke's on deck to get you that write-up, so we'll have something to talk about there if that comes through in time.

[01:00:00]
Athena: Great. We'll see you both tomorrow. Thanks so much. Have a good night.

Polly: Thank you. You too. Bye.
