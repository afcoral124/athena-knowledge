TRANSCRIPT - CORRECTED VERSION
Call Date: 04/15/24
Participants: Athena, Steve, Polly, Gil, Justin
Purpose: Buyers Club updates and deal strategy

[00:01:10]
Athena: Would love to get some updates. I know we've got some exciting meetings and it seems like everybody's running towards offers right now, which we love. Steve, we'll get an update from you first, and then Gil, I know you have some exciting stuff coming up, so I’ll pick on you next.

[00:01:35]
Steve: Yeah, I don't have much of an update to be honest with you. On Friday the broker said she wants to go through all the offers and expected sometime this week that she was gonna really go through it and pray on what she's gonna do. I wanted to call yesterday morning at 8:00 AM, but my mind says don't put too much pressure on this lady. I was going to give it until tomorrow; if I haven't heard anything by midday tomorrow, I'm gonna do a soft reach out.

[00:02:15]
Athena: Great. Also, because it was a highly competitive deal, give everybody a quick overview on how you got to this point and the tactic you used.

[00:02:25]
Steve: Yeah. So it's a towing company, out of state for us, but we're willing to do that transition. Everything looked good. Worked with Ryan and just kind of hammered it out. One of those businesses where you're like, okay, recession or boom, cars are breaking down. It's been in business since 1977. The husband is out of the business; the wife still owns it. She's in her early eighties. Her daughter and son-in-law run the operations. They want to retire in the next three to five years but would like to stay on. If we gel as people, it seems a no-brainer if the numbers work out, but we haven't done any due diligence yet.

We tried to get down to visit them and got pushed back at the end; all the calls and everything were too overwhelming for her. So we pumped the brakes and backed off, said, do what you gotta do. They did a call for offers. We actually, working with Ryan and Athena, made the decision to skip the indication and go right to LOI; I put an LOI in front of them. And then on a really smart suggestion by somebody here—to do a video.

[00:03:55]
Steve: My wife and I did a video. Polly and I did a short video, like two minutes, introducing ourselves, our interest in the business. Nothing spectacular, just get to know us. The broker came back and said they loved the video; the owner loved the video. I spoke to the broker who said it was a nice touch and set us apart, but now the owner's choosing two to three folks to do some face-to-face and really get down and dirty. We're patiently waiting, and patience is not one of my strong suits.

[00:04:45]
Athena: First LOI out—really exciting. Also a great example of building connection when a broker is gatekeeping. A quick video cover letter can help create a relationship when you can't meet directly.

[00:05:20]
Steve: Two points. Number one, Polly had to call herself with the woman. I was busy, which is probably a good thing because I get very bottom line. Polly didn’t even get into the numbers; she sensed the seller was nervous and focused on connection. Number two, we did the video in one take. The hack behind it: I leveraged AI. I gave it five prompts—here’s the message I’m trying to get across—then asked it to make it conversational. We edited the parts that didn’t sound like us. It gave us the framework. We did it in under an hour, start to finish.

[00:06:25]
Athena: We love AI for speed. I use it for conversational help and to script out negotiations too—like, what would Chris Voss from Never Split the Difference do in this scenario? Video cover letters can go over exceptionally well when you can’t get in front of the seller. The imperfect, human energy is often more trustworthy than something overly polished.

[00:07:35]
Athena: In a competitive situation where the seller’s praying over offers, they're weighing variables: working capital inclusions, any earnout or rollover, likelihood to close, and who the buyer is. You had some feedback from the broker on your LOI—share that?

[00:07:55]
Steve: Two things. They got nine offers. We were the only ones that included working capital, which separated us—in a bad way. Athena and I talked it out: what’s the likelihood and reality of working capital? We pulled it out. We also moved from 95% cash with an SBA loan and 5% seller financing to a slightly higher price with 10% seller financing. The broker was coaching us a bit, saying he thought they'd go for that. They did have at least one all-cash offer, 100% with no stipulations. We’ll see. It was nice to have a broker who engaged with us.

[00:08:50]
Polly: It was Casey originally; she’s the intermediary between the client and the prospective buyer. I dealt with her on a couple of calls—she was great. Then Lawrence, who more or less runs the place, is now involved with all of the offers. He called to tell me about the working capital feedback and got Steve on the phone. He was helpful—he wanted to give us a fighting chance too.

[00:09:25]
Athena: That’s because you made yourselves likable and easy to work with. With nine offers, he didn’t have to come back to you. It speaks to the power of relationships with the broker as well as the seller—being quick, responsive, easy to deal with. Price matters, but so do ease and likelihood of closing.

[00:10:10]
Steve: Polly asked the broker for preferred lenders, even though we’ve been working with Live Oak, etc., just to convey we’re open to guidance if that’s the best way to get it closed.

[00:10:25]
Athena: Smart. Brokers get a 1% referral fee from lenders—it doesn’t affect your deal terms. Brokers will also put you top of their list if they think they’re gonna get an extra bite of the apple. Even if you don’t end up using their lenders, indicating you’re open before making an offer can put you top of the pack.

[00:11:10]
Polly: Casey asked if we want the list of their attorneys too. I was like, sure, send them.

[00:11:20]
Athena: I don't think attorneys can pay referral fees, but great to show you’re open to their people. You can’t be forced to use them, but smart tactics like that get you favored. You’ll potentially hear in the next couple of days. Please let us know when you hear feedback. Congrats—getting an LOI out and negotiating these variables is a big deal.

[00:12:30]
Athena: Quick note on working capital for everyone. On smaller deals, it may be easier to remove it and lower the purchase price rather than trying to educate a broker who’s not used to it. In this case, nobody else included working capital. If it comes up later in diligence or with the bank, you can address it after you’re under exclusivity and have built the relationship.

[00:13:55]
Steve: Just waiting. We’re rooting for this one.

[00:14:05]
Athena: Good work. Thank you. Well, I’m gonna call Gil up next—looks like you’ve got a meeting scheduled and started talking tactics and strategies with Ryan on next steps. Give us an overview and how we can help with strategy.

[00:14:25]
Gil: I have a seller call today at 6:00 PM—another hour and a half. It’s an exhibit group that does trade shows. I’m excited to meet the seller. I found a Chamber of Commerce interview of her during COVID on Facebook—helpful. I wrote a list of questions with a small intro for myself. The goal is to finish with, okay, when can we have a cup of coffee together?

[00:14:55]
Athena: Is the broker joining?

[00:14:57]
Gil: Yes, he arranged the Zoom.

[00:15:05]
Athena: How are you gonna play this call?

[00:15:10]
Gil: Very heavy on rapport building. She mentioned she wants to retire and travel with her husband—that’s a common point. I’ll also touch on the fact that I broke my back in enough trade shows myself, standing there for 13 hours with badges. I have some icebreakers and topics. It’s the first date; I’m taking that to heart.

[00:15:45]
Athena: Love it. It’s not necessarily an industry you’ve worked in, but you know the customers deeply—you’ve been the customer. You’re big into travel, so you’ll connect. A small gift I’ve brought when a seller wanted to travel after retiring: a scratch-off travel map from Amazon—about $30, Prime. If the coffee happens, bring it: “Here’s a travel map for when you retire.” Little touches create reciprocity and show you’re thinking about her as a person.

[00:16:35]
Athena: Ryan also suggested talking through what happens at the coffee date—have you gotten that far?

[00:16:42]
Gil: I’m focused on this call. We’ll circle back if it comes to fruition.

[00:16:55]
Athena: Amazing. If you get that coffee date scheduled, we can talk strategy for it. Anca, can we dig out the link on my Amazon account for the travel map and maybe just shoot it over to Gil so he doesn’t have to research it?

[00:17:15]
Athena: Great. Anything else we can help with?

[00:17:20]
Gil: I have two other deals in the fire right now. One I have to make a blind offer on—only after that they’ll start talking to you. And one, I am chasing the broker. He emailed me Friday; I emailed him back Monday. I haven’t heard back yet; I’ll ping him again tomorrow.

[00:17:45]
Athena: Gil’s in a situation where brokers are reverting to questions and gatekeeping. He’s been persistent—“hi, I’m still here.” Feel good on the questions-only one or the blind offer?

[00:17:58]
Gil: I’m fine on both. On the questions-only one, I shot another set of three simple questions on Friday—no response yet. On the blind offer one, it’s not binding; I’ll make a lower-side offer at a 3x multiple and take it from there—it’s a risky business given tech and politics.

[00:18:25]
Athena: Ryan talks about “what number would make it a no-brainer for you?” If it feels like a loss at their ask, no harm in submitting an offer or even an IOI explaining your reasons. On on-market deals, it’s getting more competitive; sometimes you have to make offers with limited information and be clear you’ll need to confirm things post-LOI. Use a pre-reviewed legal template—binding only around exclusivity and confidentiality. Make an offer that feels comfortable with the information you have; if they haven’t given you enough, tell them, and know adjustments may be needed once real information arrives.

[00:19:35]
Athena: Cool. Great. Good luck tonight—send us an update and let us know the outcome and how we can support.

[00:19:55]
Athena: I think I saw Justin here. Justin, are you around?

[00:19:58]
Justin: I'm around.

[00:20:00]
Athena: Awesome. Any updates on the big one we were working on?

[00:20:05]
Justin: They received it and confirmed. Owner said, “Hey, thanks for jumping through hoops, being late to the party, with all of their LOIs and IOIs they've received.” He got it and said they’ll be reviewing all of them now, and I’m a part of that. Questions sound like they’re still open if they have them, but it’s a holding pattern right now.

[00:20:35]
Athena: Great. Give everyone a quick update on what happened and how you got here.

[00:20:40]
Justin: This was the latest opportunity Luke helped bring. By the time I got to it, it had been listed for a few months. It’s a roofing company and the broker specializes in roofing and has a structured process for how his clients evaluate interest. He held an open period collecting LOIs and IOIs—any kind of interest from the market—then closed the window to evaluate side by side. I was last to the table; they had been sitting on some offers for weeks, maybe months. They were about to close their window when I caught wind. I was under the gun to get in front of them quickly. The broker recommended I do it quickly, so I did. I had a follow-up call with the seller to ask additional questions. I liked them as people. Within a few days I had an LOI in front of him, which I submitted yesterday.

[00:21:45]
Athena: LOIs. It’s so exciting. It also sounded like they left it open a little longer for you to sneak in because from the feedback they were giving you, you were kind of the favorite, right?

[00:21:57]
Justin: Don’t know if I was the favorite, but they liked me. It’s a sizable deal—outside my initial scope—so it’s catching private equity attention. Many offers are PE. The seller told me he’d rather not sell to PE all things equal and would rather sell to an owner-operator like me. That said, they’re evaluating from the best financial position for the seller. I love “we like you,” but will it sway dropping a couple million more? That’s essentially what I’m asking compared to some of the other offers.

[00:22:45]
Athena: Supposedly. Imagine if there was one at the higher end they were saying was actually there—why leave it open this long?

[00:22:55]
Justin: He said there was “hair” on it for the seller—earnout, rollover component, or heavy involvement required from the seller, which he doesn’t want. So maybe more zeros, but with attachments. I tried to minimize attachments while keeping it financially viable. We’ll see—they’ve got 8–10 offers on the table.

[00:23:25]
Athena: When you sent it over, did you allude to being flexible?

[00:23:30]
Justin: As much as I can be. I didn’t want to play too many cards because I don’t know what’s hearsay versus factual. I said I’m here for questions; if anything gives reservation, I’m an open book. Facilitate a conversation to uncover hangups. Financially, this stretches me to the nth degree, so I can’t be too flexible and still make it work. Maybe there’s a shot—they like me enough to give it a crack.

[00:24:10]
Athena: If they like you and want to work with you, there are levers we can pull, especially on something like this. When you looked at structure and potentially bringing in investor equity—how did that feel?

[00:24:25]
Justin: Different for me. I went in not wanting investor input. I’ve had partners in real estate—some great, some not—and it adds complexity. My vision was smaller deals I own and control. This one’s interesting with meteoric growth—an anomaly—so I considered extenuating circumstances, including investors. I’d evaluate it as an outlier, but it depends on who those people are and the working dynamic.

[00:25:15]
Athena: For the group: larger deals can be great fits. Businesses are hot for investors now; many want to park cash and not be involved. I normally say don’t bring in investors, but the economics here can be compelling. You can give a small portion of equity and make them limited partners—retain control. In this situation, you have leverage: you found the deal, you’re operating, you’re putting a personal guarantee on the line. You can set terms—take it or leave it. Also, can you find investors who add exceptional value—retired operators with networks? I worked on a deal last year needing to raise a fair bit; they found neighbors with amazing networks who’d double revenue overnight, but they were done operating—“we just wanna be a limited partner”—and didn’t want day-to-day. You can get mentors who support you without being involved daily. For a deal this size, you can also unlock private debt—funds that lend versus equity, sometimes a mix. They like larger deals and prefer it under LOI first.

[00:27:05]
Justin: In real estate, I’d get soft commits without a deal—“if I had something, would you be interested?”—then bring a tangible deal. Tiered approach works.

[00:27:20]
Athena: One of the best things I learned: when you want money, ask for advice; when you want advice, ask for money. Make a list of anyone who indicates interest and may have capital. When you have a deal with a time crunch, ask for advice—“here are the numbers, I need to raise X by Y date, what do you think?” Many will ask the minimum. At worst, you get advice; at best, aligned capital from people you’d want as advisors—now incentivized to answer your calls.

[00:28:20]
Athena: When might you hear back?

[00:28:22]
Justin: No timeline given. If I asked, they’d probably indicate. The seller started emailing me directly (still CCing the broker). If I ask John, he’d likely tell me—end of this week, next, etc.

[00:28:45]
Athena: How are you feeling?

[00:28:47]
Justin: Question mark. I’ll be surprised if they entertain my offer given what I’ve been told is on the table and the seller’s goal for the highest cash. But it’s been educational—reps on the modeling, filling out the LOI, all of it.

[00:29:20]
Athena: Exactly. When you’re learning while delivering, it feels fast. Just getting here is a huge win—next time you’ll move even faster. It hits differently when it’s your deal and your adrenaline.

[00:29:45]
Justin: For sure—first one on a real time crunch. Others were calm, non-competitive. This one: “we have nine offers; get yours in 48 hours.”

[00:29:58]
Athena: Great work. If you don’t get it and have a good broker relationship, ask for a feedback call—capture learnings. Phone is better than email; they’ll divulge more. Also, if you love the deal and don’t get it, keep the broker warm. In super-competitive processes, high flyers sometimes blast over-ask LOIs to get exclusivity then retrade; deals fall apart. If you stay front of mind, you may be next in line.

[00:30:45]
Athena: Quick check: what’s your mind at with the furniture one or the design one? Are you gonna keep moving that one along—due diligence data?

[00:30:55]
Justin: Yeah, moving that along. That one’s calm—no other offers. I’m working toward further evaluation and trying to put something in front of the seller that makes sense. This roofing one just took precedence due to timing—and it’s huge.

[00:31:20]
Athena: Great work. Anything else we can help with today?

[00:31:25]
Justin: I don’t think so.

[00:31:30]
Athena: Awesome. Keep us posted in the channels if anything transpires or if we can jump in.

[00:31:40]
Athena: As we wrap, quick note on perfection in offers. Thursday we’ll spend more time on the financial modeling—bring questions on competitiveness, working capital, investor money, maintenance CapEx, scenario planning—anything blocking you. Always make a new copy of the latest template; we’re adding features based on your feedback.

[00:32:20]
Athena: When making an offer, there’s no way to get it perfect—limited info and time crunches. Think: if everything checks out as they say and things go okay post-close, what’s the worst that can happen? What’s the least I need to know before deciding to make an offer? I don’t condone the cowboy approach of crazy all-cash, high-price just to retrade. But we often must operate off limited info. Have a million questions—that’s expected. Just ask: what’s the minimum effective dose of info I need to move forward, knowing what comes next is a deep dive?

[00:33:25]
Athena: After LOI, lenders will do a deep dive before issuing a proposal—lots of questions get answered. Then you’ll have a QoE (Quality of Earnings), legal, insurance—teams looking at everything you haven’t thought of. The LOI is a big deal, but it’s still malleable at offer stage because there’s so much to be discovered and stress tested after you’re under offer. We’re trying to win exclusivity to look under the hood. If we don’t like what we see, we can walk away. You’ll have a whole team with experience helping you decide before you sign that 100-page loan doc and put your house on the line.

[00:34:45]
Athena: Does that make sense? Cool. It’s exciting, but remember—the goal is to win the opportunity to get full visibility. Please keep us updated. Ryan’s back, full team in force. Thursday we’ll go deep on the modeling—bring your questions. Thanks everyone.
