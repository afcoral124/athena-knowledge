[00:01:10]
Athena (AcquiMatch): Cool, Polly's here. Hey, Polly. Hey there. Amazing. Nice to see you. So we've got a few new joiners with us, Michael and Federico. It's their first time in Buyer's Club. They’ve joined us as clients, and then Polly and Gil have been with us for a while. Polly and Gil, I would say, are our superstar Buyer's Club attendees. They're at almost every single one and have gotten a lot of benefit in the deals that they've been looking at and the progress that they've made as a result. So we use them as an example of, if you can make as many as you can, you learn a lot. So any first-time Buyer's Club advice, Gil or Polly?

Gil: Um, like you just said, uh, just open your ears and you learn a lot from other people's, uh, comments and things. Cool.

Polly: Yeah, I can, I can second that. It's a lot of, a lot of information at times, but, um, always. You're always happy to, uh, answer questions and all that. So it's, it's a good setting.

Gil: Awesome. Thank you. And then definitely rewatch, um, more than once. Yeah.

Athena (AcquiMatch): That's good. Especially the financial modeling stuff, right? That's what we're gonna be doing today, which should be a fun one.

Gil: Yeah. Those are some of the best as well, so, yeah.

Athena (AcquiMatch): Yeah. We've got some good ones getting on the docket going forward, but any highlights? What's been your favorite so far?

Gil: I don't really have a favorite, uh, but, uh, there are many highlights. I mean, just the—if you just take a look at the roster of the guests that we had, uh, if you have access to those previous, uh, um, Buyer's Clubs, you’ll learn so much. Yeah.

Athena (AcquiMatch): Awesome. Anyone? The ability to rewatch—

Polly: —is great. I said the ability to rewatch is great. I can't—I would have to go through the whole list and tell you which ones were my favorites, ’cause there have been a lot of them now.

Athena (AcquiMatch): I think Denise's was a fan favorite, ’cause that just felt like a Netflix episode—

Polly: —deal going. Yes. That was actually one of my—I'm glad that you brought that up. But yeah, that was a good one. Um, Matt Marlow was a good one as well. Um, yeah, that stands out. There have been a lot of good ones. Like I said, I would have to pull up the list here to come back with faves since there have been so many.

Athena (AcquiMatch): Cool. Well, typically on Thursdays we do a little bit of a longer session. I'm gonna get that updated in everyone's calendar ’cause we plan on an hour and a half, but I just realized it's only been in people's calendar for an hour on Thursdays. This is typically when we bring in experts. So today that will be me doing financial modeling, but we bring in usually outside experts every Thursday. Tuesdays is deal review time. Hey, Peter's here. Hey, Peter. And Tuesdays is when we'll go through y'all's deals and you can talk with each other and get feedback from the full team and the other folks that are joining and just learn through people's processes too. And I think that's been super useful—to just kind of hear where people are at; feel, you know, maybe some catharsis that you're not alone in this experience when bad things come up. But also for me, I definitely learn through other people too. ’Cause when you're inside the problem, it’s kind of hard to see it for what it is. But when you see somebody else going through the problem, it's like, oh, cool, I see what the solution is, etc.

[00:04:00]
Athena (AcquiMatch): So today is gonna be fun. Luke has picked out some P&L statements. I have not seen them before. So the idea is I'm gonna pull up the financial model, I'm gonna pull up these P&L statements and just show you all how I would take those P&L statements, put them into the financial model, how I might start looking at structuring the deal. So one of the P&Ls has an opportunity for a performance-based note based on its past history. I want to spend some time kind of talking through that structure and what that might look like and try to simplify the explanation if I can. It's a bit of a complicated one, but it's a really cool tool when you wrap your head around it. In the right situation, it allows you to kind of push offers up pretty high in some instances and incentivizes the owner—like an earnout. But we can't do earnouts with SBA. So I love this tool, and I've used it in a lot of structures with clients successfully.

[00:05:00]
Athena (AcquiMatch): Hopefully I don't end up making an absolute fool of myself. I haven't seen these P&Ls before because I wanted to just show you all blind—when I look at a P&L, what am I looking for? How do I put it into the financial model? I remember when I first started doing this myself, and I didn't have the model that we did, I literally had to try to create formulas from scratch and, man, it was like trying to learn French without a tutor and it took me hours. So it can be frustrating at first, but it gets really quick, and I know clients that have used the model now multiple times—it gets easier every time. And Gil and Polly, I know you guys have used it a couple times—at first it's like, holy shit, it's like a million sheets and there's so much there, but when you understand the mechanics of it, it gets easier.

[00:06:30]
Athena (AcquiMatch): Let me share my screen. Okay, so first P&L that Luke pulled—my request was a really good P&L so we can see what good looks like putting it into this spreadsheet. And then the second one is not a great one, it's just one that's in the SIM and we're gonna pull it in there and talk about performance notes in that second version. Just a reminder: what happens in Buyer's Club stays in Buyer's Club. We're all under NDA together, so please don't share anything from this outside of us, ’cause we are using some examples from previous deals. I'm gonna share my entire screen because this is an Excel, and then the model is—you’re gonna be making a copy of it. The link that you have on the dashboard just makes a copy every single time. So we're gonna do two of these today, hopefully. We'll see how time goes.

[00:08:00]
Athena (AcquiMatch): Let's go into this P&L. This is cool. This is a whole bunch of things—looks like maybe it was audited financials of some sort, or they just had a really good accountant or a good broker that actually got them to do their books properly. There's a lot in here and it can be kind of overwhelming, but we've got balance sheets, which is great—we don't necessarily need those today. On the very first page, we just kind of have an overview, it looks like, of the financials. Then we've got the EBITDA calculations. It looks like they're using adjusted EBITDA, which is pretty much the same thing as SDE. There's EBITDA and then there's adjusted EBITDA where we do owner's benefits back to it. Normalization adjustments means normalizing or basically making the financial statements look like what you, as the new owner, would have if you were to make all of these adjustments. So I'm gonna start here ’cause this looks like this is gonna give me mostly what I need. Oh, no it's not. So we want to look for income, cost of goods sold, expenses, and add-backs. We're gonna come back to this ’cause this has our add-backs here. Let's go to the income statements. We got monthly revenue smoothing. Ooh, good. There's so much in here. This would be very overwhelming, and most of this you're not gonna need early on. All we're trying to find is top line—

Ida (AcquiMatch): Year by year. Let's see if we can find that.

Athena (AcquiMatch): There we go. Okay, so when we see “F,” that means forecasted, typically. So this is made-up numbers. Right. This happens in startup land a lot—startups will say what their valuation is or what their revenue's gonna be. For me, forecasting is made up. When you have an existing business, obviously you can make some assumptions, but I never ever listen to what they say on the forecasting unless they've had booked revenue—there's invoices and that sort of thing. So when you see F or “forecasted,” just know it's made-up numbers, right? So you want to do your valuations based on what's happened in the past. So we're gonna use ’22, ’23, and ’24, and then we're gonna go into the sheet and we've already got it set up that it is ending in 2024. Now we don't have any trailing 12, so we're gonna use the same date because the trailing 12 is what we're pulling the valuation off of in this. I always leave these standard to just assume it's gonna be an asset sale, you're gonna make it an S corp, and leaving it at the highest tax rate because that's gonna be the most conservative for you. Unless you're in a situation where you're gonna be using a ROBS and you know for sure that you're gonna be doing a C corp or something like that, you can change it later down the line. But for most of you, you'll be probably running your business as an S-corp. This isn't going to make that big of a swing unless you switch from asset to stock sale—then it has pretty big tax implications that hit your free cash flow. So that's all you're really looking at here: does the year and the format that I am making this purchase in roundabout make sense?

Also, the statements, you know, typically it's accrual—or, if you were on Elliott Holland's call or you rewatch Elliott Holland's call, accrual‑ish is usually what we see for most businesses. Then this is where I'm gonna spend my time—in the Financials tab. Gonna get rid of all this so that I have a clean place to work and I have nothing here. This is an example column—what should be a negative and what should be a positive. These numbers are all made up; they don't have any impact on anything here.

[00:13:00]
Athena (AcquiMatch): I'm gonna start with ’22 and just go from there. What's my total revenue for each of these? Copy that and add it in. And it's just pretty much that manual thing for all of ’em. I wish there was a better way. I paste it up there so it doesn't mess up the formatting. It's pretty manual to do this, but you can get pretty quick with it after some practice. I like doing it manually because it also gets you a little bit connected to the numbers as you're going through it, and you can start picking up on variances. So already I'm picking up that there was a big jump in revenue from ’23 to ’24, and down here it's telling me—yes, it was a 29% revenue jump in ’23 to ’24. I might highlight that and come back to that as something I'd like to understand why that is.

Then I'm going into—doesn't look like they've done any cost of goods sold. Okay. That's interesting. I don't actually know what this business is, but why is there no cost of goods sold? And is that because they're not running their books properly? Oh, there we go—cost of goods. Yeah, they're literally not running cost of goods. So if you're in the state of Texas, for example, we get franchise tax and it's based off gross profit. So if you truly have a business where you can have cost of goods sold—which is, there are expenses related to selling a product—like, I have a landscaping business and I have subcontractors that deliver the landscaping, that's cost of goods. Other things to run the business—advertising and marketing that can't be attached directly to a product—that’s where your operating expenses come in. So now I'm gonna pull operating expenses from each year and drop it in. We don't have any cost of goods, so it's just gonna stay the same. What's really important here: put a minus sign so you want those parentheses around there so that it's deducting it. Do that again three times.

[00:15:35]
Athena (AcquiMatch): So I see that the operating expenses were higher in ’22 than they were in ’23. It looks like they had about flat revenue, but they reduced their operating expenses by a hundred thousand. That's one I'm gonna wanna ask about. Then it went up, but they also increased their revenue significantly. So I'm looking at the percentage of operating expenses—went up and then it kind of went back down. Then when I go into the financials, we want to look at interest, depreciation, amortization, taxes. These will typically be under the expenses and we add this back to the numbers. So these are the numbers that get reported to the IRS and your taxable portion is on the net income, but you as the new owner will likely not have the same interest payments. Depreciation is kind of a made-up number based on—I won't get onto my rant about capital expenditures—but it's really important that we put the depreciation numbers in here. So let's see if there's anything in these P&Ls. I'm just scanning these here. They don't have a ton of expenses in this, so I'm not seeing interest, I'm not seeing depreciation, I'm not seeing taxes. Let's see what they put in their EBITDA. Yeah, net income and EBITDA—so there's no adjustments there. So I'm guessing these folks aren't tax optimized because they're not doing cogs and also no depreciation, which—maybe it's just a business that doesn't buy any sort of equipment. But I saw “print and mail” on there, so product, print, and mail. So I'm wondering what the products are and what they're printing and mailing for people.

[00:18:00]
Athena (AcquiMatch): Okay, so now we have our add-backs here. Let me go back to our sheet. So we have nothing here, but when we add in depreciation we're gonna get an average here, and what's really important is that you copy over—when we have a case like this where we don't have the most recent 12 months, which is trailing 12 months—we copy this over to the column here because this far right column is what the spreadsheet is gonna calculate from. Then we're in the add-back section. You can—I'll usually delete all these or use these as a guide of what am I looking for in the add-backs. But when it's blue, you can add things. What some folks do is put things in revenue adjustments—you want to be careful on this because this is literally adjusting your top-line revenue. It's not an add-back section. So if there's like a one-time thing that would increase the revenue for that year, then you would add that here. It's not often, so if you're putting something in the revenue adjustments column, just make sure you want it added to this top-line revenue number, not as an add-back.

Now we're gonna look for what their add-backs are in this sheet. Owner’s benefits, monthly support services. Hmm. I'd be like—when I don't know what an add-back is, that's something immediately that I'm like, okay, what is that? Why would you be adding that back? So I'm just gonna copy all these ’cause they're in one line. What I do when I do the modeling is I add back everything and I get their number first before I make any adjustments or before I question whether I think it's a valid add-back or not. I just want to get this number to be whatever their number is so I can see how they're valuing and whether I agree or whether it makes financial sense for me to do that. Now I can grab all these—well, they made it so easy. I love it when this happens; you can just copy and paste multiple things all at once. Values only to keep the formatting nice. And then we're gonna pull all these over here.

[00:21:00]
Athena (AcquiMatch): Now, if I've done a good job, then these numbers down here should match the numbers here. So 844,383—nope, we're off somewhere. Oh, there we go—normalization adjustments.

Ida (AcquiMatch): Interesting.

Athena (AcquiMatch): Oh—yeah, they adjusted these. Okay. I see what they did here. When it says “adjusted,” it means that they have adjusted these for what—it's either normalized or adjusted. So when we see the adjusted number here, they've put the numbers in based on what you, the new owner, would have if you accepted all of these add-backs.

Ida (AcquiMatch): Unadjusted—

Athena (AcquiMatch): This is interesting. I'm not gonna do the math with you here. I'm gonna grab these. Let's see if I can do something, because I want to actually analyze all these separately. Cash to accrual. Okay, so these are some accounting adjustments that they made. It looks like maybe they were running their books on cash—they adjusted it to accrual. You want to be careful on that to make sure they're not choosing a time period that makes the numbers more favorable. Sometimes the brokers will advise ’em on that. So this is one I would highlight for sure—what happened? So I'm just gonna highlight these in here. This Owner's benefits, monthly support services—what is that?

[00:22:40]
Athena (AcquiMatch): Fair value adjustment—it looks like they are doing a negative add-back, which means typically we add back one owner's salary. If there are two owners that are leaving, then we're gonna need to replace one of the owners. So when there's a negative add-back, it's like, well, how much are you going to have to pay to replace one of the owners? Looks like they've done that here. Then you're getting a positive add-back for owner two. Support staff salary—that's a negative add-back, so they're saying that there's additional support that's gonna be needed—what's that? This one for sure is jumping out at me—this cash to accrual adjustment. You know, that's something that you're gonna have to dive into. SBA loans are underwritten off tax returns, so as long as the books can be tied up to what's on the tax return with this adjustment, then it can all make sense. But I've been in deals where this gets really messy—when they had cash statements but they maybe reported accrual, and then there's this box that needs to match on the statements to be able to tie it all together. Sometimes the add-backs can be questionable there. And then owners took a lot of money out of this business the final year, which they didn't do in the previous years. That's also interesting.

[00:24:00]
Athena (AcquiMatch): What you're seeing is me looking for variances, right? Where does something jump out that was not there before? Why did they suddenly take out that kind of money from the business in that year but not in previous years? What did they do in 2024 that got them that kind of growth—pretty significant growth. Is it sustainable? I'm just looking for things that jump out at me that—when I get on the broker call, or even the owner call—I can ask them about and dig into that, because the first thing the lenders are gonna do is ask you about every single one of these variances, right? And you want to have the answer for it. So it's better to start seeing if you can spot those variances, which is why it kind of sucks to have to manually enter all these numbers—but you see how as I was manually entering it, I was kind of looking at ’em and being like, oh, that's interesting. So I feel like it kind of connects you to the numbers a little bit more.

Now what I need to do is get these numbers to match these numbers. I wouldn't normally do this, but I'm not gonna take you guys through all of the calculations. So we want to get these equaling—actually, the only thing I need to adjust—sorry, ignore this. The only thing I need to adjust is getting this number back to this one because this final number, this adjusted EBITDA or SDE, is what we're gonna use for our valuation. So I'm just gonna get this to be this. Let's see if it doesn't get mad at me for doing a circular thing. No. Okay. Right. Any questions on adding financials into this tab so far? Like, you wouldn't normally edit this column—I'm just doing it for the sake of the valuation—but in terms of how I just did all of that before I move on to structuring. All good? Making sense? Okay, cool.

[00:27:00]
Athena (AcquiMatch): Now the next—these are the two tabs you're gonna be spending the most of your time: Financials and Deal Structure. Now we get into the deal structure, and this is where we get to start playing around with what this deal might look like. I always start with whatever the asking price is on the business and whatever terms that they're saying they want so that I can evaluate where they're coming from and how far off I think we might be from this making sense for me. So let's say they're asking for a 3x multiple. You get two inputs here on purchase price, so you can either handwrite it in and it will tell you what that multiple is, or you can do it by multiple—you toggle A or B to decide which one you wanna do. So let's say it's a 3x multiple—that would put it at 3.4 million. These blue boxes you don't necessarily need to fill out. If we had a depreciation number that would be pulling through here, because it's likely—if there is depreciation every single year—then you might have to make those investments into the business going forward. So we're gonna leave it at “Average” for the annual CapEx and it's gonna pull it out in the model down the line later. You can add in what your CapEx requirements are as you learn more about the business and just toggle that to “Input” versus “Average.”

This working capital requirement of the business is really important. If they're trying to not include working capital—or when you start, you won't know this off the bat—but when you get a little bit further down the line, you're gonna know what the working capital requirement is of the business, especially if you do a QoE. So let's say they come back and say you need 200,000 but the seller is insistent that they're only including 100,000—you would put it in like that. But let's just say working capital's included in this one. We're putting in 10%, so we're just gonna do a straight up SBA situation here where we're putting 10% down for equity injection of the total purchase price. And we're gonna—I'm seeing 9.5 right now pretty much for most—so this is where on most of your deals you're just gonna be filling in the 7(a) loan section. Let’s say there’s no real estate in this one. Interest rate 9.5, term is 10 years. I always just kind of leave it like—let's assume we're getting a hundred-thousand-dollar line of credit. And then here is where you can start doing seller notes and forgivable performance notes.

[00:29:50]
Peter: Yeah. Yeah. So how would you model out—I'm at the beginning of a deal right now where the purchase price is one thing and then it says, doesn't include inventory. And so—okay, that's cool—which means it's not a real purchase price, right? I mean, it's like you could tell me inventory is a dollar, which it significantly is not, and then it's purchase price plus a dollar, which is a real price. Right? So how would you model that out when it's like they're saying, oh, it's probably somewhere that's basically double the purchase price? I mean, as an example that's live right now: the asking price is like one and a half million dollars. They're saying inventory is anywhere from one and a half to two. So, okay, great, let's choose the lower number—it's really three million dollars right now, not one and a half.

Athena (AcquiMatch): Yeah. So tactically I would model this assuming that I'm including working capital because my offer is going to include net working capital. With inventory, they're going to say, oh, there's one and a half million dollars’ worth of inventory. Some of that inventory's probably been sitting there for 10 years or however long they've bought the business, right? When you buy a business, there is a certain level of inventory that you need on day one to be able to run the business on day one until you start getting paid from people. So what I do is I don't start getting into those conversations first. I have a conversation with the broker, with the owner, I see if I like the business or not. I start developing a relationship and then I can get into deal terms later. But I start from the point of assuming like either they're including working capital or I'm lowering my purchase price for working capital.

Now, with inventory—if they have excess inventory, the way I typically like to treat that in a deal is: you have your net working capital. The way I describe this is you've bought a vending machine business from someone, right? In order to run that business, those vending machines need to be stocked. If you've bought a vending machine business from someone and you take over day one and there's no inventory in the vending machines, then you've just bought the machines—you haven't bought a business. So when you're buying a business that requires inventory in order for it to run, you don't yet know what the working capital requirements are because you don't know their payment terms with suppliers, you don't know their payment terms with clients. When you get more of that information, you'll be able to work out: okay, they take a job from a client but they don't get paid for 60 days, but they have to pay their suppliers within 30 days. So when I take over day one, I need enough candy in the vending machine to be able to keep servicing clients until I get new money from the people that are paying me two months later. This is how businesses are valued. They got the business to a certain point by being able to extend payment terms and being able to take payment terms, and it took them a while to get that, and that's what you're buying the business on the basis of. If they say that no inventory and no working capital is included, that means that you need to reduce the purchase price to account for the fact you're gonna have to buy all that stuff to operate the business from day one. It's not a going concern.

[00:33:30]
Peter: So you're basically buying enough of the inventory to operate day one, right?

Athena (AcquiMatch): Correct. That’s included in the purchase price—that's considered working capital.

Peter: Sure. Correct, correct.

Athena (AcquiMatch): That's why I leave this blank to start, ’cause you don't know the working capital requirements of the business. You don't know how much inventory is required. So when you get to the point of making an offer in an LOI, we're gonna be basing this offer on the fact that they're including enough inventory to keep you going until you get the next payments from clients.

Peter: I see. So it's just for the model—it's an assumption that enough working capital—whenever I pay you, the assumption is it's enough working capital.

Athena (AcquiMatch): Exactly.

Peter: And then of course as the LOI—I'm assuming it's like, okay, this LOI is contingent upon folks in the deal not being total goofballs about working cap.

Athena (AcquiMatch): There's a section in the LOI template that says that this includes net working capital, which will be determined during due diligence. Because you can't figure out how much working capital you need without access to all of the things you're gonna get and having somebody actually look at how is inventory flowing in and out, which inventory is it, how long does it take for them to get paid from clients, how much of that inventory is dead, etc. It's such a complicated calculation that you would never do that pre-LOI. If they're saying that no working capital is included, then we have to try to make a determination of some number pre-LOI and reduce the purchase price for that, because regardless of whether they're including it or not, you're gonna have to pay for it. The bank's gonna make you, right? You can't take over that business day one and have two months before you get paid and no inventory. You're gonna have to buy that inventory to be able to operate from day one.

[00:39:00]
Athena (AcquiMatch): For the purposes of today, basic calculation: always assume that you're gonna have net working capital. When you start getting information—this model can work with you through the deal. If your QoE person's like, you're gonna need 500,000, or the bank's like, we want to see at least 500,000 working capital in here—you put it in here, and then if they're leaving nothing in the business, well, your free cash flow number shouldn't be affected by the fact that they're not leaving that in. So then you start toggling purchase price.

Peter: Got it. Okay. Cool. Thank you.

Athena (AcquiMatch): No worries.

[00:40:00]
Athena (AcquiMatch): I'm not gonna do this second P&L ’cause I'm conscious of time, and I want to spend some time talking through seller notes and particularly forgivable performance-based notes. Is everyone tracking so far on what we've done? Basically we're using a 3x multiple, we're just assuming that working capital is included in this deal, we have standard SBA terms of 9.5%, and we, the buyer, are gonna do a 10% equity injection. We're gonna assume there's no real estate in it.

Now, we're at the point where we can use seller notes, and we can use them in a couple different ways. One is on standby—we can use a seller note to have them contribute towards your equity injection with the SBA. It used to be that they only needed to be on standby for two years, and they could do 5% or even more as seller debt, which could contribute towards your equity injection. Let me use simpler words for this. The bank wants you to put 10% of the overall project costs in—they want you to do basically a 10% down payment. That can come from you, it can come from the seller, it can come from having paid for expenses that are gonna be part of this deal before—but regardless, in order for the bank to protect their guarantee from the SBA, there needs to be a 10% equity contribution. Now, in April there was a big SOP update from the SBA that changed the standby period from two years to ten years, which sucked because we used to use this all the time. We used to be able to double your buying power just by getting the seller to agree to a 5% note that was on standby for two years. Now it's ten.

[00:42:40]
Athena (AcquiMatch): The way that we're seeing this used is: let's say it's a larger deal and you're at the top end—you don't have enough cash to be able to do the full 10% yourself. What you could potentially do is increase the purchase price, ask the seller to take a 5% note on full standby for ten years, and then you only need to offer 5% of the total project cost. So you can still increase your buying power, but this is a pretty advanced move because you have to have a really good relationship with the seller and the deal still needs to work if you're going to increase the purchase price. We used to use this all the time, which is why it's at the top—now we don't use it very much at all.

Seller note two is essentially having them have some skin in the game—they're not gonna get 100% of their cash at close. I always like to see at least 5–10% from the seller as a seller note. And you can pretty much do whatever you want in terms of the terms and negotiate with them on interest rates and stuff. But the SBA does want to see them not get paid out before the bank does. So it's usually over 10 years. You can potentially do a balloon payment on this one. I typically amortize it over 10 years for the seller note, and then you can do a balloon—meaning you pay whatever's left after, say, five years. I usually leave this at “no,” and it's just a little tool I have in my back pocket if they're like, well, I don't want to wait 10 years to get paid—or maybe they're 85 and they're like, I don't know if I'm gonna be here in 10 years to get paid. I'm like, okay, how about we do a balloon? It protects your cash flow initially, and then they can get paid out. If you don't have enough money in the business to be able to do this, you can refinance with the SBA or even a private lender at that point, or just a normal commercial lender sometimes because you have that history with them—say in five years.

[00:45:00]
Athena (AcquiMatch): The forgivable performance-based note is where I have the most fun, and it's the one that gets a little complicated and a little bit like, what? Private equity uses something called earnouts, which is incentivizing the owner to help them get the business performing better than it has in the past. And if they do that, they are rewarded with more money. Now, SBA doesn't like this—we can't do earnouts. We can't just say, okay, Mr. Owner, I know you've never gotten more than a million dollars in revenue, but if you help me get the business to two million in revenue, I'll pay you a whole bunch more money. You can't do that. What you can do is incentivize them to get the business back to something that they achieved in the past.

[00:46:00]
Athena (AcquiMatch): While most people see what they're perceiving as revenue drop in ’23 and ’24, it's usually a normalization—most businesses had a drop because of COVID and then they had a catch-up in ’22. So they had a big year in ’22 and then they dropped in ’23. If we're only looking at the last three years, we see high number then drop. If you look back historically in the performance, it might be a normalization back to pre‑COVID levels. But if we see a year in the past that was higher than it was in recent years, then we have the opportunity to incentivize the owner to get the business back to what it's performed in the past. And if they don't do this, then that portion of money that we're saying we'll pay them is forgiven. So it's called a forgivable performance-based note because it's based on performance after you buy it and it's forgiven if that performance is not met.

We can use this both to incentivize the owner to get back to historical numbers, or we can use it to protect ourselves if we're worried that they're gonna have a drop in revenue. So we could just say: you need to at least perform—like maybe they had a massive year, like what we saw here, right? In ’24 they just jumped almost 30%. Is that sustainable, or did they beef it up to sell it? Okay, well I need to do a forgivable performance-based note based on the business achieving $1.9 million in revenue in the first year of my ownership. You're not incentivizing them to do more than they've done in the past. But if that is not sustainable, then that portion of the deal can be forgiven.

[00:48:00]
Athena (AcquiMatch): So let's say we feel like 20% of this purchase price should be forgiven if they don't hit the numbers that they hit in the previous year. I always recommend doing this as pro rata if you're gonna be doing a benchmark to get it up to something. If you're doing just flat year-on-year, then it's a target, which is the minimum percentage (0%). If they don't at least hit that, then 20% of the purchase price will be forgiven. You can base it off it being achieved in the first and second year of ownership or just the first year. So if you're like, okay, Mr. Seller, I just want you to show me that this business can achieve $1.9 million in revenue in the first year. If it does, then I will pay you 20% of this purchase price. I'll do it over nine years at 7% interest. Is everyone tracking on the concept of the performance note?

[00:50:00]
Athena (AcquiMatch): In a no-change scenario, I always recommend doing a no change where literally nothing changes—no revenue growth, no operating expenses increases. Best case is like, okay, if the seller's telling you they've got all this booked revenue or whatever, you can say, let's do a 15% growth year one, year two. This is where you get to wave a magic wand and have fun and make up numbers, right, and get yourself excited—but we never, ever buy a business based on potential. The S&P 500—those companies typically don't grow by more than 5% a year. So just be careful of whatever benchmark you're putting for best case. Then best case on your operating expenses: are you gonna be doing any reductions or growth? There are some kind of standard ones in here, but just pay attention to this one, and if you wanna be more conservative, you can do that.

Then your worst-case scenario is accounting for a J curve. Let's say you have a 10% revenue drop both in year one and year two and then you're flat for the next three years, and then maybe have a 3% growth year six through ten. And you also have 5% increase in expenses year over year. For this example, I'm just gonna show you what it looks like if you have a 10% drop with the performance note and everything else the same. So we have 10% drop, and then this scenario that I'm talking about here is 0%, etc. These boxes here—if you want to make a one-time adjustment, I'm not gonna get into that now. But for this one, let's say I’ve said 20% will be paid if they at least hit 0%.

[00:52:00]
Athena (AcquiMatch): Then we can go over to these tabs here and see what that looks like in our no-change scenario. This business achieves $1.9 [million], no more; all of the other expenses stay the same. We're accounting for our own tax payments and everything. There's something here that's not working—oh, I didn't—operating income. I need to make sure that I added that all back in. Let me just go back to the Financials and make sure.

[00:53:20]
Athena (AcquiMatch): There we go. That's more reasonable. Okay, so this is a number I always go to first: what's the free cash flow to you, the buyer—this is after taxes are taken out, after CapEx, after all the other operating expenses that you're gonna have, after your debt payments. This is what hits your bank account. What's really important about this number is to understand this is post-tax, right? Because we have that 37.5% tax rate in there. So this is money to your bank account. That's something that—when you're comparing what your salary is versus what your take home is and looking at these free cash flow numbers—you just want to bear that in mind. And then your debt service coverage ratio. This is both to the SBA and the seller, and if you were to fully pull your line of credit. This is pretty decent—you’re able to make it the whole 10 years and it's only near year 10 where you're getting below 1.5 debt service coverage ratio. It turns red whenever it's below 1.5. This is with a fully pulled line of credit—so the third line you don't pay attention to as much. But let's say worst case, they don't make those numbers—you have a 10% drop—you don't owe that performance note, right? So it's not being pulled out here. Performance note—nothing's coming out in terms of performance note payments. You do have a 10% drop in revenue and then you're flat after that. These are the numbers that you make, but you're still okay from a debt service coverage ratio perspective. That's why we do the performance note—because you're still protected.

[00:55:00]
Athena (AcquiMatch): Now, if we didn't do the performance note, then you have to pay the full purchase price regardless of what happens. Let's look at what happens here when we put the deal structure in and we take that performance note out—you're in a worst-case scenario and our take-home is significantly less, and we're below debt service coverage ratio. We can still make it; it's not ideal. It's because we did a 3x, which we're not typically gonna see if we have a million in EBITDA—but let's say we do. Your take-home numbers are not nearly as fun. For most of you, that's not enough to make it worth doing an investment of this size. So that's why a performance-based note—even if we can't tie them to getting higher numbers—we can create a performance-based note to have them at least perform in a certain way. Typically, we're gonna do this if they're asking for a pretty high asking price. Here, where it's reasonable, you might not get somebody agreeing to that because somebody else will come in and offer the whole thing and maybe just 10% note.

Athena (AcquiMatch): Did that concept make sense in how we put it into the model here?

Ida (AcquiMatch): Yeah.

Athena (AcquiMatch): Cool. Good.

[00:57:00]
Athena (AcquiMatch): We're at time. It was a really silent session, which always makes me nervous. Was that helpful? Do we feel like we have a little bit more—we could be dangerous with the notes? Federico, you have a question?

Federico: Uh, yes, I do. I just wanna make sure I understood correctly regarding the performance-based note. Is that payable, uh, over 10 years? It cannot be paid before, is that correct?

Athena (AcquiMatch): No, you can pay it before as long as the debt service coverage ratio still works. So that's what the bank's gonna be looking at and why we have it in the model that way. Here, let me pull it up—

Federico: Oh, okay. So what was it that you said about the two years not being accepted anymore? It had to be the 10‑year mark.

Athena (AcquiMatch): Yeah, it's if you're using a seller note towards your equity injection.

Federico: Oh, okay, the equity injection. Okay, got it.

Athena (AcquiMatch): Exactly. That's this first one, typically. It used to be that you could have the seller take a 5% note and then you would only need to contribute 5% instead of 10, and they could start getting payments after two years. Now it's ten.

Federico: Okay, perfect. That makes sense.

Athena (AcquiMatch): With the performance note, no. What the SBA is gonna check is this here—does the debt service coverage still work if you have to pay the note, or in this no-change scenario. If they actually perform the way they do, you're golden. Usually in a no-change scenario I want to see at least greens for two, three years. J curve is gonna hit—in two years you might be flat. I've had lots of clients and friends—they didn't have the J-curve drop, but they didn't have an increase either. They were able to keep it on track. So you want to see at least two–three years of greens here in these top two boxes. Again, this third one is if you were to fully draw the line of credit—which they also look at—we've included this here because when you send it over to the lenders when you start getting to that stage, they're like, whoa, you've really thought of everything and done all your modeling. They get very frustrated when people are like, what do you think? And they're like, have you modeled this at all? Have you done any cash flow forecasting? And then they’re seeing that you're looking at worst-case scenarios across the board. You can, on those other notes, do a five-year balloon if you want. Or you can pay ’em over a shorter amount of time—like let's say you amortize it over five years—but this still needs to be typically above 1.5 for most lenders. Some will go down to like 1.15, but I don't ever like seeing y'all go below 1.5 because you need some wriggle room. If something happens, you want a little bit more of a buffer there. Even though some lenders will go lower, I—and the team—will never in good conscience tell you to go lower on a deal, ’cause it's a little bit scary if you literally have no buffer and something goes wrong.

Federico: Absolutely. Thank you.

[01:00:00]
Athena (AcquiMatch): You're so welcome. Any other questions? What I think is a good practice is just taking those P&Ls—any deal that you have any sort of interest in—take those P&Ls and drop ’em into this financial model, right? And do what you saw me do at the beginning. Yes, it's a little monotonous or whatever, but as you're going through those numbers, you can start picking up on things and then you have something ready to go. You get on the broker call and you're like, okay, broker didn't have any information, I'm gonna go and talk to the owner. Talk to the owner—I'm like, I love them. I know there's other people in the mix. Then you're not scrambling to try to get the model together—you've already put it together and it helps inform the questions that you might ask to the broker and the seller. I have trained myself to the point that I can't really give comments on a deal of whether it's good or bad without looking at that—what's the upside to you? What are they asking? What does that actually look like in cash flow and debt service coverage ratio in the terms that we’re asking about, you know, and what they're saying. It's good practice, I think, both from a valuation standpoint, but also being ready to go and kind of getting your reps in to do this for every single deal.

Some of our folks that have been here longer have had all sorts of interesting financial statements that they've had to navigate. Polly and Steve were looking at one that had like three different locations and three different P&Ls, and they had to compile ’em all together to try to do modeling and stuff. There's no standardization for how the brokers present the financials, so we kind of need to be an investigator and do it on every single one.

[01:11:00]
Athena (AcquiMatch): But anyways, I hope that was—We were just discussing as a team, you know, Cash is looking at a deal where there’s all these like crazy add-backs and he's like, I don't know about this. And it's like, okay, yeah, totally—like that's what we should dig into and ask about so that we can give you that. It's not necessarily that we won't put it in front of you, but you want to flag those things early to have the discussion because when you get to the lenders, a lot of times they'll throw out a lot of add-backs, and that will materially affect the SDE. I think something Elliott said—either in his most recent session or the one before—is like when they're gonna get three or four times every single dollar that they find as SDE in that business, of course they're incentivized to try to say as many dollars as possible are going to be to the new owner's benefit, you know? But yeah, I've seen some wild add-backs in there before. And I've even seen financial statements that made me break out into hysterical laughter. Never forget that was Steve and Polly.

Polly: That was an awakening moment right there. We kind of thought, eh, that doesn't look—once you started laughing out, we were like, okay. It's even more unrealistic than we thought. So—

[01:12:00]
Athena (AcquiMatch): Anyways, cool. This was fun. Next Tuesday we'll do deal reviews as normal—any questions or modeling or things about the deals that you're looking at. For those of you that are working on some—some of you are still waiting on your new ones. I have a conversation today that hopefully I will be able to announce next Thursday's expert. But on the 21st, definitely put that one in your calendars. It is a tax planning expert. He is very energetic—kind of like shouty used-car-salesman energy about taxes—which I think is a lot of fun. He's really well known, great speaker, breaks down complicated things very simply. And his firm does both the legal and the accounting side of tax planning in acquisitions. As a new owner, I don't think we can get more—tax strategy I think is one of the best things you can start learning. If you've been in a W-2, you don't have a lot of tools that you can use. But as a business owner, there's only seven pages of the thousand pages of the tax code that tell you what you must pay. There's 993 pages that tell you how to save money out of your taxes. And typically that's through business ownership. So we can never learn enough about this. But when you do an acquisition, there is a tax event that can be pretty dramatic depending on how you're buying. So he's gonna be talking about all that on the 21st.

[01:14:00]
Michael: One quick question, Athena. I apologize to the group if I'm the new guy and gonna keep people late asking a question at the end. But the financials that you looked at and you converted them into your template—I’m assuming those are anonymized or fake financials. Is that right? And if so, could you share that? I could run through the exercise of putting ’em in the template myself—or even the messy one that you didn't go through—assuming that it's not an active, legitimate company or has been anonymized. If it's proprietary data or real data, I wouldn't want to—

Athena (AcquiMatch): I feel like there's homework on your dashboard with some anonymized financial statements.

Michael: Okay, I'll go look again.

Athena (AcquiMatch): Yeah, this one’s not anonymized, but that's good—so, Ida, let's look into that and see if we can get some more anonymized examples for people to start messing around with. So yeah, Michael, we can get that over to you. This one in particular is not anonymized and it's got all sorts of watermarks.

Michael: Understand. If it's proprietary or real data, I wouldn't want to—yeah, understand.

Athena (AcquiMatch): I don't mind throwing it up, but we can absolutely anonymize some more and give it to you if you want some more practice. So leave that with us; we'll get that over in a couple days. I never think you can get enough practice, so it's—

Michael: Not a problem. I could probably mock something up as well, but I just wanted to—if it was already done, maybe I could leverage it, but yeah.

Athena (AcquiMatch): It's pretty easy for us to get some more of those over to you, so we'll do that for sure.

Federico: Yeah. Thank you.

Athena (AcquiMatch): Well, great to see you all—had fun today. I'll see you next week. Have a great weekend in the meantime, and we'll see you soon. Bye.

Polly: Take care. Bye.
