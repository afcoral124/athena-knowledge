# AcquiMatch Buyers Club 05/21/2025

[00:00:00] 

**Athena:** Hello. Welcome. Apologies for the delay. My computer had a little meltdown with Zoom, so I had to restart. Nice to see you all. How are you? Good. How are you doing over there in South Africa? Uh, amazing. I have not been to this country before and we're like in the town area and it, I, I can't get over. How stunning.

The scenery is, and the landscape is just beautiful. 

**Polly:** I've heard that. 

**Athena:** Yeah. I mean, it's, you just, I, I wasn't expecting it at all. So it's, uh, it's pretty phenomenal. Um, like I. The drive to the restaurant we went to for lunch earlier was like all along the coast. So I was like, I feel like I'm in like Venice Beach or you know, like Malibu right now.

And then you just end up in the like forest. And then on the way back there's like this whole forest with these like humongous trees. [00:01:00] And I'm like, are we in the redwoods? And then there's baboons running across the street, like in the forest. It's just like, and we went and saw penguins, there's penguins, there's lions.

It's, it's, it's wild. 

**Polly:** That's so great. That sounds like. So much fun. Lots to see. Yeah. 

**Athena:** Yeah, it's, it's really good. Um, so it's nice to see you all. It's Tuesdays that we get to talk through deals and I know, uh, Steve and Polly and, and Gil, you've probably both had some developments. And then, um, Peter's here with us as well.

So, uh, Peter is, uh, gonna be having to search officially start with us on the 1st of June. But, um, Peter, I don't know if I've given you a proper introduction yet, so. Um, do you wanna say, since we have a few moments, say hey and where you're at and, um, maybe a little bit about the acquisition that you've done, and if everybody else wants to introduce themselves after that too, so we just don't have you silently joining these, uh, buyer's clubs.

**Peter:** Sure. Uh, yeah, so I'm, I'm actually in Chicago, [00:02:00] uh, Athena. I just realized you're seven hours ahead of us. Uh, and we're on 3:00 PM It's 10:00 PM where you are. Uh, and so that kind of. Blew my mind. Uh, but, uh, yeah, so I, I acquired a business, uh, back in 2018, uh, a small industrial supply distribution business called Miller Industrial.

And, you know, we sell all sorts of maintenance and repair SKUs. These are things like, um, uh, fasteners paint for commercial applications, abrasives, adhesives, lubricants, tools, PPE into, uh, small manufacturing channels. Um. Uh, all throughout the O'Hare Airport area. So we're in a very, like hyper-local, uh, district out by Chicago's main airport.

Um, so now, uh, survive Covid, uh, bought the business with an SBA loan. So, uh, many things have changed since I was in the game, so I feel like I'm starting over. Uh, and you know. [00:03:00] Seeing where this all goes on, on, uh, opportunity number two. So, uh, I feel like I'm searching again for the first time, but once I'm in the seat of operating a business, that'll be very, very, very, very, um, not first time, right?

So it's like a weird experience. I've actually spent more time operating a business than I have searching for a business. So I still feel very new to search, but definitely not new to operating. 

**Athena:** Yeah, which is so cool. And we're so excited to like, look at the strategy for like, not only, um, you know, who Peter is, but how that fits in with what he's currently doing, um, and the kind of vision that he has about bringing design thinking to industries or, or, you know.

Businesses that haven't typically like, thought about design thinking at all. So it's, it's an exciting brief and also helping him with the wild world that the search community is now, because when he was searching, it wasn't, [00:04:00] you know, I don't, I don't even know if Walker's book was out then, or if it had, it hadn't caught fire the way that it is now.

So it's just kind of a different landscape. So excited to have Peter here. Um, and then, uh, Steve and Polly and, and if you wanna maybe introduce yourselves real quick. 

**Polly:** Um, actually, actually Steve, you wanna go ahead 'cause I'm not exactly sure how long, um, he's gonna have before he has to jump on a call. Um, okay.

So you go first. 

**Steve:** Yeah. Be really quick. K Peter, welcome. Uh, good to meet you. I've got the pleasure. Over the past several months now, uh, to, and going on year or more knowing Athena and this group here. Uh, it's a great group, but, uh, myself, I am a, currently a W2, uh, employee in the high tech world. Uh, do high tech sales for a big tech company.

Um, been doing that. I, I spent 11 years on Wall Street before I got into that. I've been in this about [00:05:00] 26 years at this point, 27 years. Uh, and looking to make that cut over to. Uh, owning some of the, uh, small businesses. Uh, got a background. I'm the only one in my family who went corporate college and corporate.

Everybody else owns businesses. They surpassed me a while ago, and now I get those golden handcuffs on and I'm trying to break free of 'em. Uh, and, and I'm partnered here with my wife Polly, who's uh, a floor above me. And, uh, I'll let her say hello and pass it on.

**Polly:** Hi, Peter, welcome. Um, we, uh, have enjoyed being a part of this group, uh, like Steve said, for almost a year now, uh, a little over a year actually, but, uh, in this specific group for about a year, and I think it will be in July. So, um, my background is. Pretty much in small businesses, uh, of different sizes. One I spent for about 15 years.

I'm working for, from its infancy all the way up to the time it was sold. [00:06:00] Um, I, my background is in, in sales and marketing, but I have operational experience on the project management side and, um, personnel management and that kind of thing. So I've worn a lot of different hats and, uh, actually really enjoy wearing different hats 'cause.

You know, like to jump around and keep things interesting. So, um, but uh, yeah, so that just kind of gives you a, a, a brief overview of me. Um, but mean if you have any questions, you're welcome to ask me, but I'll let other people have a chance to introduce themselves. 

**Steve:** And by the way, we're based in Atlanta, Peter?

**Polly:** Yes. We're BA based in Atlanta. 

**Athena:** Um, and, uh, Steve and Polly have, have. Done some cool things since they've been with us too, and just overcome some of the challenges that that folks face. So love working with them. Um, I'm gonna come back to y'all since Steve has some short timing, but first I wanna go to Gil.

If you wanna do, uh, introduction and say hi to Peter. I. 

**Gil:** Hey Peter. [00:07:00] Um, welcome. Uh, I am based out of New Jersey. Uh, been with this group for about five months now. Uh, maybe five and a half. Uh, looking at deals, uh, my background is in corporate. It, uh, grew up from being a project manager to IT leadership. Uh, did a lot of IP transformations in my career.

Uh, everything from cloud migrations to ERP implementations. Uh, since 2018, I've been an independent contractor, so I go from company to company, do a lot of interim CIO work, and, uh, interim director of IT work. Um, so now I'm starting this journey. Uh, I'm gonna take off the corporate sh sh shit off the corporate world and, uh, do this now.

**Athena:** Amazing. And Gill just went under offer on a really exciting business last week, so we'll be coming back to him for an update on where that's at. Um, cool. Awesome. Well, Steve and Polly, uh, you just had a owner meeting. Do you wanna give us [00:08:00] a update? How'd that go? 

**Polly:** Um, do you want me to do the overview real quick, Steve?

Sure, yeah. Just 

**Athena:** give 

us a overview. 

**Polly:** Just based. On the notes and then I'll let him chime in because we obviously both talked to the owner today. Um, so this is a digital marketing business. Um, it's a full ser service digital agency. They specialize in web design, development, branding, content creation. Um, it was founded in 2018.

They have many services they offer. They do UI UX. Design, web and mobile app development, motion design, visual identity, brand strategy, illustration and animation. They utilize ai, um, to deliver like scalable, future proof digital solutions. And, uh, he reiterated today that AI is really for. To, to enhance, um, you know, their projects enhance their business.

Uh, they do project-based, um, maintenance [00:09:00] retainers. So they're, they're project-based, um, contracts and the contracts are a month to month. So that's how they, that's how they do that. Um, they have a reoccur recurring revenue streams. Um, sorry. Sorry about that. Uh, recurring revenue streams, 60% are project based and 40%, um, of, uh, and 40% of of business.

I'm so sorry. I'm sitting here with my dog just going off right now. Apologize. Um. Their top three clients accounted for a significant portion of the 2024 revenue. We were a little bit concerned about that. Steve can go in a little bit more to how that played out in the conversation. Um, the duration and renewal structure, like I said, recurring contracts, um, and then.

They get, they have a lot of referrals. Um, [00:10:00] their client communication is mainly done by the owner, so he is the sales and marketing piece. Um, they do offshore, the tech part of it is done offshore in Indonesia. And, um, they have a, he said he has a great, uh, a great, great SOP infrastructure. So he has a, a playbook on everything.

Um, super sharp guy, very young. Um, he doesn't look to be anymore than I. Well, to me, he looks like he's about 26, 27, so he's young. Yeah. But everybody to us looks 27. Huh? 

**Steve:** Everybody to us looks 27. So when we get age, I know he 

**Polly:** might be a little older than that. Maybe 30. I don't know. He looks so young. Maybe he's older than I think.

And um, yeah, I'll let Steve chime in now. That was just kind of an overview on the business and um, of course I'll let him chime in and then you can ask questions. 

**Steve:** Yeah. So, um, as Pauly mentioned, you, you recognize [00:11:00] sharp people. He's super sharp, and you could just tell there's an organizational system behind it.

They've got about 12, 11, 12, uh, developers that work with them. Uh, the one of their. Value propositions I'll, in, in his words are, would be around, uh, senior, uh, developers, not junior developers. So they're trying to go high quality. There is that mix of, uh, development. They do a lot of mobile app development around, uh, as well.

They've done over 500 projects over the course of the years. Uh, the, the maintenance portion of it is once they land, that customer typically. They keep them on for any, um, maintenance, any customizations, et cetera, since they wrote the code in the first place, uh, he said it's pretty sticky in that regard.

He said they basically, when he is got a good project, they don't leave, uh, the. Some of the areas of concern that we had was, number one, was customer concentration. They, they, they went from, they tripled the revenue in a, in a year. Uh, a lot of [00:12:00] that 60% of the cu of the, uh, revenue comes from three customers, which was concerning.

Uh, one thing that's interesting is a lot of the additional revenue from last year, they changed their marketing strategy. Uh, he was just figuring it out and it's, um, what's, what's it influencer base now, and that's kind of exploded, the lead flow. He said they're on pace to do at least the same revenue this year.

Uh, that's, and he doesn't do the influencer himself. He said he's got a SOP on how they bring on the influencers and, and how to vet 'em, et cetera. Uh, but that, that's one thing the biggest, um. Concern was really replacing him at this point, because he is a very, he does the project management. He doesn't do any of the coding himself at this point.

Uh, but he does a lot of the project management. Uh, so the idea of bringing a resource on who can fill those shoes, maybe a US-based resource that can help [00:13:00] with that, um, I ask them, who's your number two? If you're not there, what happens? Who can run the playbooks? He said it's a problem. I don't have a number two.

So that's, that's some area. There's a couple of areas around that. And then customer concentration that we'd wanna look to de-risk the deal. Um, the numbers line up, uh, you know, pretty well. I mean, if you're going last year's SDE was about close to six 50, uh, the. Uh, on, on revenue of around a million dollars.

So it's a pretty healthy margin. Uh, there, I think there are like 62% margin on that. Um, as, as far as, uh, that's concerned, the, there is no price on the, uh, deal. We speaking with the broker. Uh, by the way, the, the gentleman just had a baby. He's like looking just to do, he's, he's that typical entrepreneur on board.

Wanna do something else? [00:14:00] Uh, he said he is gonna look at something else outside the field. He would do the non-compete, et cetera, and now does not wanna get back into this field. Uh, but, um, the. I lost my train of thought. Uh, SDE margin de-risk, uh oh. Yeah. So the, but the broker said to Polly and I on a separate conversation, if you came in around a million dollars, you'd probably just take it and you could probably sell that, uh, and, and, and, and have the business.

So we're, we're really at this point, we've gotta really crunch down on that, uh, financial modeling to see how can we de-risk. Large concentration. So that's kind of where we are. And we just had that call about two hours ago. 

**Polly:** And, uh, just real quick, he spends about, he said he spends about 40 to 50 hours in the business a week.

So he is the, he is the customer. He is the customer relations manager, let's put it that way. He's managing the customers, he's managing the [00:15:00] projects. 

**Steve:** And sales. 

**Polly:** And sales, yeah.

**Athena:** So you said, uh, maybe I'm misremembering this, but did he start, you said he started this 10 years ago? 

**Polly:** Uh, no, not quite 10 years ago because it was 2018. Sorry. Yeah, it's less than that, but yeah, he started it in 2018. 

**Steve:** And the way he started, basically he graduated from a tech university in South Florida and he said, I'm gonna start building some websites for some people and stuff like that.

Brought on a customer, uh, then, then he got a couple of real good customers, so he started, I. Trying to, um, build a business. At that point, it was pretty much let a see, advertise on Upwork, all sorts of things. He's literally figured it out from day one to try to get something that was more repeatable and then leveraging, um, offshore resources.

He, he, he was part, he's part of an entrepreneur community in South [00:16:00] Florida who started kind of coaching him into how you turn your little. Uh, you know, sit, single man shop into a business. And that's been over the past couple of years, 

**Athena:** right? But he hasn't replaced himself in the client management, the sales, and the, not only the sales, but like what you said, the marketing of like getting new customers in.

**Steve:** A hundred percent. He, he replaced all the technical building part, right? Himself. 

**Athena:** Okay? Mm-hmm. So. I mean, you've given me all of the logistics, right? Like how are you feeling about it now that you've had that conversation? 

**Steve:** Uh. I would say the biggest concern that I have right now, as I mentioned, was really other than, you know, the obvious customer concentration is how do we replace him?

He's the face of the business. He's got the brains behind it. He might have standard operating procedures, but I [00:17:00] haven't lived in his world and he built the baby. So that's, that's, and he's wearing a lot of hats. So there, what's the of replacing him, uh, and then, you know. So we can focus on marketing and driving more revenue, sales and marketing, where the business, there is no operator to even operate the different folks, uh, doing and, and customer service.

So there's a lot of hats. It's three jobs. 

**Athena:** If, if you were to like, just do a gauge of where your energy level or excitement level, was that going into it? And then after the seller meeting, did it go up? Did it stay the same? Did it go down? 

**Steve:** I'd say it's kind of a mix. You know, parts of it went up. The, the idea that he had standard operating procedures and, you know, very defined processes was something I wasn't expecting.

I was expecting to be more of a mess. Uh, the. Going into it, I understood they probably had four or five employees [00:18:00] out there, because that's the other risk that I looked at is, okay, you have senior level people, we scale this. How hard is it? Or how easy is it to get more senior level people out there? So the, the fact he's got a dozen folks on that, that made me feel good.

Uh, the fact that. Some of the increase in revenue came from the, uh, change in marketing, and it was actually, they landed an account through the influencer marketing who gave him the referral to the, the bigger client that they picked up last year. So trajectory looks like it's going the right way. But the other side of it where I felt nervous, more nervous about is, can we walk in there and take this thing over and, and, and run it, uh, without having some lengthy type turnover.

**Athena:** So the influencer marketing, was that to get clients for the business or was that just an aspect of what they [00:19:00] do for clients 

**Steve:** to get clients for the business? 

**Athena:** Oh, interesting. Okay. And who are their clients? 

**Steve:** We're all over the board. No verticalization. Yeah, 

**Polly:** they're broad based. There's no niche. There's no niche.

That's all very broad based 

**Steve:** and enterprise, it's all over the place. So that was right. Another issue. 

**Athena:** So it's a full stack agency, but like what makes them unique? What makes them, what's their moat? Do they have a moat? 

**Steve:** I don't see the moat.

**Polly:** It's, yeah. 

**Athena:** And, and why is, why is he selling, oh, sorry, go ahead, Polly. 

**Polly:** No, I, I'm just kind of reiterating what he said there. There there is no moat. Yeah. Which, which I was 

**Steve:** just. And the other concern I still have even going into this call is when you start talking agent AI and, you know, [00:20:00] development, app development now, now it's gonna go to, it's gonna go to, uh, agents, not even apps.

It's gonna move beyond that. Okay. What's to say that they don't just pivot to another direction when he's gone. He's got, the relationship is one source of failure. Let's go somewhere else. Let's go shop around for somebody who's gonna go in that direction. So I, I was hesitant about, that's the part that probably worries me the most is we're in the midst of a.

Changing, and maybe Gil can even comment on some of that. Uh, you know, with the IT background is that that is something that I, I think it's an additional un I'll call it a risk that's an unknown.

**Athena:** Yeah. I think, um, I mean, would you like my, my feedback, you had longer calls and everything, but, uh, my background, I think, you know, this was like at least a decade marketing agency, so, um. Marketing [00:21:00] background and working in agencies and that whole thing too. So, 

**Steve:** um, Gabe, before you jump in, I'm gonna give you the one last red flag that for me was Okay.

Yeah. It's been out there a month or so. Why with the numbers? Why doesn't he have the offers yet? That was another red flag for me. What's somebody seeing? And I think you're going to tell us what we're not seeing. 

**Athena:** Just, just real quick, I, I know you said it, but like, did you dig into why, why is he selling?

What is, what is the reason 

**Polly:** he really just wants to. Move on and do something else. Um, from what the broker told us before we had the meeting with a seller today, um, is that he's just kind of burned out with it and wants to move on to something else from, from what he said today, not only is he part of a community of entrepreneurs, you know, he, he's in some groups and that, that kind of thing, but.

He gave a little bit of an indication that his family's the same kind of a [00:22:00] entrepreneurial type of family. So he's probably wanting to change course a little bit for, uh, for whatever reason. Maybe he has another opportunity. Maybe he just wants to take a break and figure out what he's gonna do next. Not sure.

**Steve:** So I asked him directly, I said, the trajectory of this business, you're, you're hitting a great stride right now. Why? Why would you leave this, this? Why not just take it from one to 5 million at this point? And that, that was his story back. I'm not sure how much I believe of that piece, but that's, that is a story they're sticking with.

**Athena:** Yeah. I mean, I'm gonna make some strong. Inferences and generalizations and, uh, opinions here. So take it with a grain of salt. But, you know, agencies, it, it is mostly project work. It's very hard for it to be recurring, especially when like. If they haven't niched down in any way, it is very hard to communicate who [00:23:00] you service.

That's concerning to me. Somebody that is doing marketing on behalf of other people hasn't done the thing. That's kind of like standard, right? Is being able to communicate you're unique, selling proposition, being able to communicate who you help and how you help them. That's kind of marketing 1 0 1. So if they're just generally helping everyone with a whole bunch of things, then I, I also wonder like, well, how well are they actually helping their clients if they don't know who their clients are and they're not really getting deep into how do I help my clients?

Right. So it's, it's always the thing that I'm kind of thinking about from a marketing perspective or whenever I teach people marketing is. I, I, I use the analogy like marketing in itself is. Like telling a story. Right? And there's this theory that came out from Donald, I [00:24:00] can't remember his last name, but he wrote Building a Story brand, which I think is a phenomenal way of looking at marketing.

Where a lot of people, when they start a business, they think they need to position themselves as the hero in the story when actually we need to be positioning. Our client is the hero and we are the guide. And I used to use Star Wars analogies and like try to talk about Yoda and whatever, and I don't actually know the movie that well.

I only saw it for the first time two years ago, but Cinderella is one I do know well. Right? So Donald Miller, Donald Miller. 

**Steve:** Donald 

**Athena:** Miller, Donald Miller. Yes. So, you know, so like, basically, you know, then it's thinking about, well, I need help Cinderella. I'm the fairy godmother. Who is my Cinderella? Like, you know, and I, I can tell you what Cinderella's pain points are.

Her sisters are bullying her. They're keeping her down. They're not letting her wear nice closing, they're making her slaves. And it's like, okay, I have a value prop for Cinderella. It's like how much would you pay if I could bibby bodi boo you [00:25:00] out of here right now and into the Prince's castle and like Engage the Prince and like that's your happily ever after.

Like she would go and sell her mice friends to animal testing in order to like pay for whatever, you know, like I was Bibby booing her about, because I know her so deeply. So I guess that's a red flag for me as a marketing, you know, first person. Is, doesn't sound like they know who their, their clients are.

So how are, how are you gonna be able to step in there and take over a repeatable process? It's like, yeah, okay. How they deliver for clients, have some SOPs, but how do you get clients and who are those clients? How do you speak to them? How do you find more of them? What are their pain points and how are you uniquely helping them?

Now we have looked at businesses that. Had had this agency or had this, you know, owner. Replace themselves. Um, you know, had a client servicing person, had somebody that was [00:26:00] doing the sales, had all of that dialed in. See, were literally just stepping in and overseeing the strategy. And they were generalists.

They were really good at like getting, you know, general accounts or whatever. That's one thing, but this man's tired because he hasn't. Proven out his business model. He's been going for seven years and he hasn't figured out who his clients are, who his avatar is, and how he helps them. Because when you figure that out and you lock into it really specifically, then you know you can take off and it's, it's worth a lot of money.

So we've looked at businesses before where it's like we the, like we looked at this one that kept going off the market immediately because it was like a lead generation marketing agency for dentists. Right. They niche down so specifically. So, um, with something like this, we're excited because y'all are into content and, and that sort of thing, and digital marketing and, and you know, potentially a remote thing.

However, being that the owner is so deeply involved both in the client servicing and the sales, [00:27:00] I would have some concerns there. Right? Like, how would you replace that? Not having, you know, Steve has the sales experience. Polly, I think you'd be amazing at client servicing, but correct me if I'm wrong, I don't think either of you have directly worked in a marketing agency before.

So you'd have to learn that side of things while applying your skill sets to it and potentially taking from an owner that actually never figured out really how to get a stronghold on, on getting more clients. 

**Polly:** I, yes, I agree with you. And I was just thinking in terms of like, just my past experience, everything I have done has been to a very specific niche.

So the story as you were explaining the Cinderella story, I mean, that, that's the type of story I would tell in, um, working in the hos, you know, fitness to hospitality was so easy to sell that concept, you know, uh. [00:28:00] I do design and equip fitness centers and hotels. I mean, it doesn't get much more specific than that, you know?

And, um, anyway, so I, uh, and, and just everything I've done is niched. And that's the one thing I actually asked him. I said, you know, do you, do you cater to a specific niche? And he said, no. So, mm. Very broad. I mean, 

**Athena:** that's, that's worrying when you're doing marketing, you know, 'cause it's like, how do you get good?

Because if they're doing SEO and AI and using agents mm-hmm. And that sort of thing, it's like how do you get good at doing that if you're doing it for everybody, you know? Right. Um, it like. He, you know, I, I, I just, and how do you get good as a business if, if you have all sorts of different clients too? So what are the SOPs for Exactly.

You know, it sounds like you'd be buying some processes that he's figured out in terms of running an offshore team, but in terms of growing that [00:29:00] business and, and like keeping the stability of it. Like it, you could maintain their current clients and it's like, okay, we've got some influencers that are sending clients our way.

Um, which is interesting, but it doesn't give me a feeling like it'd be easy to take. You'd be buying a job and you'd have to figure out a lot of the processes by the sounds of it. Am I, am I assessing that accurately? Yeah. 

**Polly:** Yeah, and I think, you know, it, uh, it's kind of like the TGI Friday's old menu, you know, if you think about it had like 20 pages to their menu and you know, you're just all over the place trying to make a decision.

I know that's kind of a weird analogy, but in a sense he's catering to so such a broad base, um. You just kind of, you just kind of lose it, I guess. You know, you're, you don't know where to go next and, and he's relying, I'm sure on the referrals, but I would love to know, it makes me think a little bit more like, [00:30:00] are there certain.

Clients, do you have, do you have more of those than others that you're trying to, to go out there and pursue because they make up more of your business? So that's one thing we did not ask 'em is that, yes, you're broad based, but can you break that down a little bit and tell me like, are there certain markets that you find yourself catering to more than others?

So, 

**Athena:** yeah, I mean, if you're still interested in it, if you haven't like completely lost interest in it or you're not, you know, then that's a great like follow up call to just have another call and be like, well, tell me more about how you're actually getting these clients. Like, what are you telling them to want to become clients?

What problems are you solving? Right? Like, see if you can get that, that Cinderella story of like, how is this agency, the fairy godmother, like helping these. Clients, um, maybe there's something unique there to the process that he just hasn't articulated yet. But, um, you know, again, if he's a marketing professional and [00:31:00] sometimes it's hardest to do it for yourself, and it's just like, oh, it's really hard to get.

Agency work, it's really hard to be a marketing agency and get clients unless you're very specific or longstanding or niched down in some way. So I would be digging into the, the actual influencer, like how are they getting new clients, and then who are the clients? What is the, what is the actual repeatable way?

That they're servicing this, these clients, you know, these SOPs. What, what is it for? Is it generalist or is it specific in some way? Is there some value there that if you were to go in and decide to niche down, maybe that would be the unlock. But again, it's, it's kind of taking over a startup. My, you know, to me product market fit is you've really clearly defined who your customers are and, and how you help them.

And you found a way to, to be able to get that on repeat. So the influencer thing, if that's picking up, if that's good, it's like, well, what are they saying? How are they actually [00:32:00] getting customers? What are they offering to these people? What's the product that we, or the problem that we're solving, you know, how are we bibo booing these people?

Right? Like, what's. What's the, what's the transformation, what's the offer? Um, that is if you wanna keep, keep, you know, 

**Polly:** moving forward on it. Okay. Well, I've written down, I'm writing as you're talking, so, uh, I'm going to, I told, um, the broker that we would be back in touch with any questions and so I'm gonna put together these lists of questions and see if we can get those answered.

**Athena:** And then on the client concentration part, uh, stay tuned. 'cause I'm sure Gil will have some things to share 'cause he has a business that's potentially looking at that too. But there are ways in structuring, uh, to mitigate your risk by doing forgivable performance based notes. Um, when there is client concentration and, and sometimes, you know, uh, banks will [00:33:00] lend.

On client concentration, if there is a, a for substantial forgivable note to overcome the client concentration. So if those clients were lost, then you know, the, the portion of the. Price to the seller is, is forgiven essentially to kind of cover the percentage. So let's say you have 30% of the clients with one client, then you would probably do at least a, you know, 30% note, um, on the client concentration that if it dropped then you know, you would be forgiven that amount so that if you lost that client.

You would still be able to make the debt payments on what was left. So, um, okay. But I'm gonna talk to Gil 'cause he's actually been having these conversations with lenders, so I listen in on that too. Okay, thank you. You, no worries. Cool. Thanks. Awesome. So, Gil, what's the latest in your world? I know you've been having some lender convos.

You had your first, uh, kickoff last week. It looks like you're [00:34:00] potentially doing your in-person tomorrow. Wanna bring us up to the speed? 

**Gil:** Um, exactly what you said, picked up last week. Uh, and in person. Tomorrow, tomorrow night, I'll be there at five 30 ish. Uh, and walk through the warehouse, walk through the office, touch everything.

Have a conversation with the seller. Uh, hopefully buy a cup of coffee or break some butter or something. Uh, we'll, we'll see. That's not planned right now. That'll be off the cuff. I spent the last, since Monday morning, uh, talking to lenders and, uh, I've been talking to five lenders and great, uh, one bow out.

Uh, live Oak bow out because of the customer concentration issue. Uh, Wendy basically said, listen, unless there's a 50% for you forgivable note, uh, on this client concentration, that's 52%, then we're not gonna play ball. So I understand that, um, she didn't care that it [00:35:00] was from different, from different departments within the same company.

She didn't care. She didn't really matter to her. Uh, she said that she tried at some point to she had a deal where it was a public company. And, uh, they had deals from all, from international, from different, uh, places in the world. But then her bank still didn't approve it because what happens is the stock tanks, you know, there's still a very large customer concentration.

So that's one thing. Uh, the other thing is I have one banker who keeps on calling me three or four times a day. Every single time asking a different question, he is going into every single number on the every single p and l since 21 and asking me why this, why that. Um, and I understand I'm going back and forth with the seller.

Uh, I had a long conversation with her today about add-backs. Because another banker is worried about the add-backs. Um, so I'm talking to her about that. [00:36:00] Uh, everyone is worried about something else, but the common theme that I'm seeing with all of them is that they don't value the business. And what I value that.

Okay. Uh, that's the idea that I'm getting from them. Uh, obviously I won't know until I see a term sheet, uh, or, or have a final conversation with them, but, uh, that is what, uh, that's the feeling that I'm getting from them. Uh, okay. I can, we, we have a one on one tomorrow. Uh, I can walk you through each bank and each banker and their names and everything Right.

That, that, that we did. Um. But yeah, that's about that, that, that, that, that's where we're at right now. Um, I'm trying to get, one of the bankers wants to talk to the seller, so I'm trying to get a call together. Um, and uh, that's where I am. Yeah. Trying to get, uh, funding. 

**Athena:** Great. Yeah. So, um. With [00:37:00] the, I mean, they didn't completely bow out, so that's cool.

So when you start having these conversations with the lenders, they start pointing out where the risk is. So even though it can feel frustrating, right? And there's a whole bunch of questions and coming from different angles and they're seeing different things, um. I would note down the things that they're asking about as a, like, I really need to look into this and, and not only answer their questions, but think about scenario planning, right?

Like, if that does happen, that thing that they are pointing out, that they are worried about, um, how would I account for that? So I think it's a good exercise in like putting yourself in the operator's shoes, just thinking through like, okay. Let's say the scenario actually happens, like, how would I plan for that?

Or how would I account for that? Um, and, and start thinking through some of those solutions or, you know, the fact that you're going to meet the seller, just like, Hey, so have you thought about, like, so if the. One client is four [00:38:00] different cost setters and they are listed a, a listed company, right? Asking her like, Hey, have you ever thought about like, what happens if they're stock tanks?

Or, you know, has that happened before? How long had they been a client? So I would, you know, like see if they might've thought about it and they might've thought of a solution through it. Then you can go back to the banker and be like, well, I, you know, sellers been through this before with this client and or, you know, they've thought about it and this is how they would handle it.

Or, you know, if they haven't thought about it, then you can think about, well, what would I do in this scenario? Or how would I handle this? You know, so it's like I. Hey, you know, customer concentration is, is kind of scary. Like, what happened if, if all of a sudden that customer cut you off, what would you do?

You know, so you can lean on the seller too to like get their thoughts on how they would solve those problems. Um. The only thing I would caution with, uh, like getting the lenders talking to them early on is like, you don't wanna like exhaust the seller. So like, put the ones that you wanna put through to 'em that you're feeling good about to have that [00:39:00] conversation.

Um, I think two of 'em are from the broker side anyway, so we can talk through the specifics tomorrow, but I'm saying this for the, the benefit of everybody else there too. Um, but they, that's interesting about the valuing the business, so you know, it's a good. Re-trading conversation with the seller and or, you know, making that forgivable note even more appealing and attractive.

Right. So like you can build that in a lot higher, uh, and that, that might overcome some of the valuation things. Because at at present, the structure that you're putting in front of all of them doesn't have any portion of forgivable, correct? 

No. 

**Athena:** So that's a tool that we have in our back pocket that you've already, you know, broached with the broker and he got pissed off about it.

Well, you're consulting five different lenders. If they all come back and say like, not, you know, needs to be valued lower and then you can have the conversation with them, well what if [00:40:00] we did a forgivable note? 'cause they're probably valuing it less because of the customer concentration. Have they given you any indication?

What, what else is pulling the valuation down? 

**Gil:** Yeah. Um, so the add backs, they don't think that, uh, they add up. They want treat mm-hmm. On traceability for the add backs and they want, uh, to understand why they're there, uh, and why weren't they their previous years, what's going on there. Mm-hmm. So that's. I said, this shouldn't be an add-back.

This shouldn't be an A, this shouldn't be an add-back. And today I went through each and every one of them with a seller on a phone and we, we talked through them. Uh, there are some things there that I think shouldn't be add-backs as well, but I'm not an account that I, I, I don't understand. So we'll see what the banker says.

That's one thing. The other thing is, uh, one of the bankers, he's extremely worried about seasonality because when we look at year to date numbers, they look amazing. Um,[00:41:00] 

uh, they look so good that they're almost at, you know, 40% of their revenue from, from a yearly perspective. Uh, so what's going on there? Am am I going to be without any revenue, uh, for the rest of the year? So things like that, they're, they're worried about that. Um, and, uh. They're worried. Yeah. That, that, that, those are, those are the big ones.

The one thing I do wanna say is that I am learning so much from these bankers on, on, on what to look for and how to look at it and how to approach things. So even if this deal falls through, I know that in my, at my next deal, I'm gonna do a much wiser buyer and a much better client for the banks to, to, to give them all the information that they want.

**Athena:** Yeah, but you know, every deal's different too. So it's, it's good that you're speaking to multiple ones 'cause they all see different things. They have different risk profiles. Um, so it's a great learning experience. But again, like I said, it's, [00:42:00] it's, if you broach it conversationally with the seller. Right.

Like, hey, so I mean, you've had an amazing year so far. Like, is there certain times of year that are more busy than others? And, you know, you're gonna be getting the, the probably monthly p and ls from them as part of this process too. So you can see like annually over the last three years. Um, if it's not on your list, you'll definitely want it to be.

So you can look at like any peaks and troughs, like month by month. Does she use QuickBooks for her finances? Do you know? 

**Gil:** Stage. Okay. I tried to get monthly p and ls, uh, from her. She couldn't give 'em to me only quarterly p and ls for 23. And, uh, for 24, she gave monthly. Uh, okay. So I could, I could see that there, there, there is a peak in Q1, most definitely.

And a trough in Q4. Uh, but she says that she just got two new clients today, uh, when I was talking to her. And, uh, they [00:43:00] have shows coming up in September and October. So, yeah, there, there, there, there's some good stuff here. 

**Athena:** Great. Okay. That's exciting. So we're, we're, uh, encouraged. So, um, again, I'll, I'll say this for the benefit of anyone or anyone watching this back, but when things come up.

That need to be renegotiations, like the add backs, like the value of the business. We wanna hold that back from having that conversation until we get like a good list and we are at a critical point. So we can talk through the strategy around that too. What you don't wanna do is like, oh, banks said the add-backs aren't, aren't.

Okay. Like, let's redo the SDE now and then, oh, valuation isn't correct. Let's, let's redo that. So you wanna have like one max, like two kind of big renegotiation points, but you wanna like grab enough of, of, of a thing, like enough. Items to discuss that [00:44:00] we can go through and kind of categorize like what's a deal breaker for you?

What's a, this is a nice to have, but I'd be flexible on this point and kind of decide the nego renegotiation strategy. I. Is the broker gonna be there? Can you do this in person? That whole thing. So that when and if it does come up that there's a retrade, which it sounds like it might be E, either there's a retrade where we have to adjust the, the valuation and the purchase price.

'cause it sounds like you know there's gonna be add backs that are rejected. So we have to bring the STE e down, which means that we'll bring the purchase price down. 

You know, 

**Athena:** maybe by the multiple that you applied, or maybe the lenders are saying even that isn't reasonable, and we'll probably have to introduce a forgivable note to account for customer concentration.

So you kind of wanna do it all in one go. It's like, Hey, unfortunately lenders aren't agreeing with these Z backs. We're having to bring it down. Also, the customer concentration, even though it's from different cost centers, because it's all the same person and they're publicly listed. [00:45:00] Uh, there's an issue and there, there, there's risks there.

But here's what I'm thinking we can do instead, kind of make the performance no advantageous, right? Um, and I. Sweeten the pot a little bit with that, but you're protected if, if the scenario doesn't come up where like those customers go away or something like that. So, um, we can loop it all into one little nice package and talk about like how to bring those things up.

So I just caution against like doing any, oh, this add back won't, won't work. Like, don't do it little by little, otherwise you'll fatigue and frustrate your seller and your broker. 

**Gil:** No, I'm, I'm not gonna do that. Um, and, uh. I just remember when you, when you said evaluation, uh, one of the bankers wants me to pay $3,500 to a business evaluation before he gives me a term sheet.

So I'm like, let's hold off on that for now. Um, you know, I'm, I'm not, I'm not gonna shell that out right now. 

**Athena:** Okay. Yeah. I, I'd love to find out the, how all the, all the different bankers. Talk [00:46:00] through that tomorrow and see who's, who's asking for what, who's doing what to cool. Awesome. How are you feeling about, uh, your in-person meeting tomorrow?

What's your strategy for that? How are you walking into that? 

**Gil:** Um, I am going to walk in with a smile on my face. Uh, I have, uh, the map. I got that. I'll, I'll give her that map with a scratch off of the world. Ah, yeah. Uh, and have her scratch off some stuff. Uh. We're gonna do a walkthrough. I want to physically see, touch, understand what she's been talking about for the past month and a half.

Um, I want to sit down with her and talk to her about, uh, the clients. Uh, I wanna talk to her not only about, she keeps on going on about how the business works. How she does things. I want, I, I want to touch more on the ephemeral things as well, uh, and see how, how that happens, what the, what the culture is with the, with with [00:47:00] the employees, um, things like that.

Uh, I, I, I have, I have a list of questions that, that, that, that I have for her that, that I started and I'll just pull it up on my, on my, on my phone and go through it. 

**Athena:** Great. Awesome. Can't wait. Uh, and that's after we're chatting tomorrow. Is that right? It's five 30 at night. 

**Gil:** Yeah. 

**Athena:** Cool. Okay, cool. Well, I'm excited to hear how it's going with the lending more deeply and we can talk through the, the questions and everything if you want to do that tomorrow too.

But, um, exciting update for everybody here to hear because the, the Lender, lender road show is, is always different for every person. It can be a little frustrating, but I, I. Even though it's frustrating and it feels like a lot, I think it's kind of cool to have that many eyes on your deal when all they do is like look at numbers and stuff.

So it can just like flag areas that you need to dig into yourself, whether you work with them as a lender or not, it's like, oh, here's an opportunity for [00:48:00] me to learn more about this corner of the business that they saw. There might be an issue, and how would I account for that issue? 

Yeah. Yeah. 

**Athena:** Um, very cool.

Well, um, also, I got a interesting, so, uh, our favorite lawyers, Barlow and Williams, they are, um, sending over some ways to overcome the equity injection issue too. Um, so there's, they're seeing people structure the deals where they're pricing the deal higher. And putting 5% on tenure standby to be able to lower the equity ejection portion from you.

So they're intentionally kind of overpricing the purchase price by a little bit so that the seller gets what they want, um, at closing, but for taking on a 5% note, you know, or however much note. On full standby for 10 years that that can lower the equity [00:49:00] injection requirements. So they're, they've got an active deal right now and they're gonna let me know if, if that actually goes through, if the lenders like, approve that one.

But that might be a nice tool in the toolkit if, if equity injections tight on anybody's deals too. 

**Gil:** Excellent. 

**Athena:** Cool. Alright, well um, great to catch up with you guys uh, on Thursday. We've got um, version four now of the template that has just hot off the presses and Polly, I was laughing 'cause I knew you were about to dive into the modeling and we just took it offline again.

She lost updates. I was like, get it up. So Paul, you can use it. So just hot off the presses, the, the template, um, it's the same link that y'all have, but it's version four now, so there'll be some new features in there. Uh, so on Thursday I plan on bringing that up and, and working it through with y'all and kind of showing you what's in there.

Um, it's been revamped for real estate specifically. Um, so it's a little less confusing with how to add real [00:50:00] estate in the deal, 5 0 4 7 a if you wanna apply the seller note to the whole of the thing with the real estate in there. So, um, some cool stuff and then also just some more clarity around maintenance, CapEx and that sort of thing.

So on Thursday we'll be doing a session where I'll pull up my screen and do some financial modeling, but the, uh, newest template is available to you all. As always, if you see any bugs or issues, please let me know and we'll fix it immediately. But we, we test these before we put 'em out, so shouldn't be any issues there.

Um, then for the, uh, 29th, I believe is the next date, Anka, is that right? 

**Anke:** Sorry, let, just 29th 

**Athena:** is on the 29th Thursday? Yeah, 29th at Tuesday. Okay. Wait, no. Thursday? 

**Anke:** Yeah, 29th. 

**Athena:** Yep. Okay. So next week on the 29th, we're gonna have Henry who is an investor and he raised a fund specifically to help [00:51:00] folks with their equity injections and invest on deals where there might be a technology need or, you know, just a good like investment.

Um, he's been super active and really helpful in the, uh, the searcher community here in Austin. So he's gonna be coming and breaking down kind of investor 1 0 1. On a deal where you might wanna bring in an investor on a little bit of the equity injection. Um, and then the following week we're having Denise Montenegro.

I don't know if Evelyn, her partner's joining as well, but, um, they bought a landscaping business and oh my God, the horror stories that they went through are pretty unbelievable. But they got through it and now like. They've got a profitable business. So Denise is gonna be coming and sharing their story of buying a business, all the things that went wrong, how they overcame it, and, and the happy ending at the end.

So I'll preface that like it's, you know, I like bringing in the stories of like the realness that happens when [00:52:00] you go through this. I think what happened to them was pretty exceptional and rare. Um, but, you know, just. Continuing to show you stories of resilience, um, because no matter what business that you buy, no matter what business that you get into, the resilience and like the problem solving is like a common theme of, of how you get through it.

So that will be a good one. Um, and then we've got some others, uh, that we are planning for weeks after that. We're just confirming dates, so experts and outsiders are coming back to buyer's club and sharing some really cool stuff. So. Um, thank you all. It's fun to experience what Anka ISS experiencing with these hours here in South Africa, but I've got, got a lot of coffee to like, wake me up.

I know she does that too. So we'll see you all on Thursday. Uh, and we'll do some financial modeling. Oh, Steve, I see your hand up. What's that? Oh yeah, 

**Steve:** so just one thing. So I, I copied on a couple of emails. I dunno if you're checking your emails as well. But a couple of contacts we made this weekend. Yeah, so I, since you're out of town, [00:53:00] out of pocket, I know my routine always changes when I leave my desk.

**Athena:** Thank you. Yeah, no, I'm keeping an eye on everything, so, um, and I'm back online officially, uh, until Thursday and then Friday off to start acas festivities. Uh, but the team will, uh, still be monitoring things in around on Friday. So, um, and then, uh, and then we all have a long weekend memorial day, which is pretty exciting.

**Polly:** So. Cool. Just to let you know, just to remind, um, next week we will be. Gone, um, on vacation. So we will not be on, on Tuesday or Thursday, but we'll get caught up on with the, with watching the, the videos. 

**Athena:** Awesome. Yeah. We'll record 'em. Cool. Well, thanks so much. Y'all have a great rest of your day. Um, and we'll talk to you on Thursday.

Well, I'll see. I'll see y'all tomorrow. Sorry. See you tomorrow. Okay.
