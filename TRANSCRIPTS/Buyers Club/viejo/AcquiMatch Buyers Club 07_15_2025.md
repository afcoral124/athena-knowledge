# AcquiMatch Buyers Club 07/15/2025

[00:00:00] 

**Athena:** i'm curious to hear what you guys thought of John's presentation last week. Gil? I can't remember. Were you there also? 

**Polly:** Yes, I was there. 

**Athena:** Paul was there. Gil, were you there? 

**Polly:** No. 

**Athena:** Oh, okay, cool. Um, so Polly was there. I think maybe Justin was there. I think Justin's joining maybe. 

**Polly:** Um, 

**Athena:** lemme see if Steve, Steve, John, 

**Polly:** just lemme check real quick.

Um, he said he is gonna be joining in a few, he's on a call right now. Steve is. Okay, cool. Just to let you know. So, 

**Athena:** and then Justin, I can't remember if you were there last week or not with John. Yes, I was 

**Polly:** there and so was Steve. 

**Athena:** Oh no, sorry, I was asking Justin. Oh, okay. 

**Justin:** Sorry. Yeah, no, I was, I was unable to make it, but uh, yeah.

**Athena:** Okay, cool. Well, Polly, what did you think of John's presentation? 

**Polly:** I thought he was great. I really did. I, um. You know, [00:01:00] as far as like picking out one specific thing, I mean, I, it really resonated with me about the, the, his emphasis on customer service. And of course that's always been near and dear to my heart.

Um, I don't know, I thought his whole presentation was good. I cannot give you one very specific thing. I thought the customer, uh, service thing was very interesting. I think that the, you know, the type of coaching that he does is, you know, it makes me wanna ask him like, even more questions after what ha after watching the presentation because while you're watching it, you're trying to pay attention and you don't wanna be distracted by some of the things that maybe I wished I would've asked, but didn't really think about them until after I was off.

So, but, um.

I mean, I think I, I think some of the questions that you were asking him were really great as far as just like staffing and, and, [00:02:00] um, ways about going to find people. And I don't know, just I, I was, I was paying attention. I can't give you a very specific thing that stood out, but I thought all of it was great, but, but you always have really good people on there anyway, so I learn a lot and, um, I try to be as observant as possible, so I, just because I'm not asking questions doesn't mean that I'm, I'm not paying attention.

It just, it's trying to take it all in. Yeah. No, I 

**Athena:** hear you. Um, Steve, I just saw you join. Did you have any, um, thoughts or observations or takeaways from John's talk last week? 

**Steve:** No, I thought he was great. Um. I can't remember the example of that, but I think we, I referenced him the next day when Paul and I were doing something totally unrelated to, to this.

And, um, no, I, I think he, you know, very, very well thought out. We used, 

**Polly:** sorry, we used something regarding the, um, being a co, [00:03:00] uh, being a coach instead of a consultant. Was that, so that's what we used, you and I were talking about, but 

**Steve:** can't remember. Something totally related. But yeah, the whole difference between a coach and a consultant and, you know, some of those concepts and kind of walking in and I know, I, I thought he, I thought he was real good.

Always learned something. 

**Athena:** Yeah. Um, so for Justin and Gil, to give you a little fomo, to go back to it when you're closer to ownership, um, John wrote one of the books that's actually on my bookshelf, even though I'm the book lady and I read a million books, um, he kind of reminds me of like, um. Like even pre traction, right?

Like he has been doing, helping, like both owning a business, doing it remotely before it was even a thing. And, um, then helping other business owners for so long. Like, it was really interesting to hear him say things that I was like, oh, I've heard [00:04:00] Layla Hormoze say that, or, oh, I've heard that, you know, so, and I'm like, I feel like, you know, these are, these are the people that have these original thoughts sometimes or just have been giving this kind of advice.

And then it trickles down and into the newer people that we're listening to. But, um, so John, uh, does, um, oh my gosh, I can't remember the name. It's a really clever name, but basically like also coaching for new owners of businesses when they acquire a business. So how to actually go through that process of.

Taking it over and becoming an owner and looking at the why and how to, you know, systematize things and how to focus on outputs rather than, you know, just kind of like, ah, what do I do and where do I do it? So he offered everybody a free, uh, coaching session also. Um, I know Peter was really, he, Peter was actually in the middle of reading his book when I announced him.

And so Peter's already followed up with him being a current business owner. [00:05:00] But, um, it's really good to start thinking about, like really close to ownership. I think some of the stuff, it's like, oh yeah, that sounds good in theory, but like, if you wanna hire a specialized person, and we were talking about like hiring and recruiting and what do you look for and what are those kinds of qualities.

So, um, he has a ton of really good experience and information, but I. I think what's really cool about him is he's one of the like founders. He was like one of the presidents of the International Coaching Federation ICF. So like that's pretty much the biggest body of, of coaches also. So, um, tons of knowledge and experience there.

Um, what's good for me when I listen to folks like that is just getting kind of like confirmation, you know? 'cause like sometimes you hear things and it might be the new thing or the thing on the internet, but like when [00:06:00] you hear confirmation or you know, direction from somebody that's been, or like doing this sort of thing for as long as he has that, that also feels good.

So, um, yeah, he's very well respected in these circles too. Does anybody remember EDA or anyone what the name of his transition support coaching was? Anyways, Steve, I saw your hand raised. 

**Steve:** Yeah. Yeah. It's coming back to me. Sorry. I, my, my day, my, my first call this morning was a presentation at 4:00 AM so Oh, fun.

**Polly:** I love, love those 4:00 AM presentations. It was an 

**Steve:** early start today, so it's all coming back to me. So it kinda like the e myth for small businesses, and I think that you talk about the confirmation that, hey, this is, uh, simple, but it's not easy. Yeah. Walk through a couple of different scenarios, but he was very, very much on delegation and process.

Um, you know, as far as, you know, getting, oh, I, I, I like to use the word playbooks, but basically walking in and [00:07:00] systemizing everything. Kind of just observing and understanding what the actual, what, what are you working with today, where's the lack of systems? And then he talked to a bunch of stories on all the disasters that can happen along the way too, but really kind of, and, and then, then trying to, I, I would almost say get yourself out of the business of being the operator into somebody.

Running the business through, uh, systems and processes. That's kind when I, I remember when he was speaking, I was the, like the, the old E myth started really kicking in, um, you know, really around systems. And I think I, I can't remember who he gave this, this exact example, I think he did. But like, you know, McDonald's does not have the best hamburger out there, but man, they have the best systems out there.

Um, so that, that type of concept, yeah. So he really drilled in on, when, when you walk in, it's gonna be a mess. Uh, you gotta figure out the systems, then you gotta figure out the right people to run the systems. So that was my big takeaway. 

**Athena:** Well, yeah, because he was saying like the CEO, you're like a conductor, right?

And like the conductor comes out at [00:08:00] a symphony. Concert and like, they get applause even though they're not playing an in instrument. So I, I liked that analogy of like being a true owner. That's not in the day-to-day necessarily, and you're kind of the conductor of the business. Um, so I, I'm just pulling up my notes.

I I, I got this wrong when he asked the question and he said, what's the one valid business reason? You know, what, what's the one reason a business exists? Does anyone remember what that was?

**Polly:** No. Repeat the question one more time. What, what, 

**Athena:** what's, what's the, what's the purpose of a business? What's the one valid business reason to exist as a business?

It was to create a customer. 

**Polly:** To create a customer. Yes. Yeah. And I was like, oh, you know, 

**Athena:** like, I thought it was like Tito. Create a [00:09:00] service or whatever. But I, I liked that thought too, right? The business doesn't exist if you're not creating customers. So how do you create customers and like create a product that they like, deliver a good service?

You know, all of the things that are wrapped up in that. I thought that was a pretty cool one that I took away. Also, something that, um, I've started implementing myself, although I'm reminding myself I'm not being as good about it as I should be, was he talked about, uh, keeping a CEO notebook. So every day kind of writing down, um, what did you learn?

What, what came up today? Where were you confused and how did you solve it? 'cause as you go through this journey, often you don't realize like, what day did I actually figure that out, or what was my learnings on that? But I think it's something that. You know, you all could actually start implementing now, like going through the buying journey too.

'cause there's so much that you're learning, you're drinking through a fire hose when you're going through m and a and it's like, well what did I learn today either about a business characteristic or about the process, or where was I confused? Where can I get clarity? And just kind of like [00:10:00] keeping that journal of, of your progression.

Um, or like, you know, if you're like, I remember going through this situation before going back to my notes. So, um, I'm, I've started keeping A-A-C-E-O notebook for the business, but I thought it could be cool for your m and a journey as well to just, you know, keep top line notes on, on the things that happened.

Or if you're a journaler, like spending more time writing. Yeah. Steve. 

**Steve:** Yeah, no, just is totally unrelated. But, uh, this, so this weekend we moved, uh, my youngest daughter back from college. So, uh, Polly and I drove out together. Uh, my daughter and my, and Polly drove back separately, so I did my three and a half hours or four hours of binge YouTube listenening.

So, on the way back, so you guys probably know the, the person I'm gonna bring up. Uh, I'm not, I, I, I'm not super familiar with, like, personalities don't mean much to me. I just try to learn stuff. Uh, but there's a guy, he's an investor, I guess you'd call him kind of a founder of a bunch of businesses. Dan Martel.

Yeah. So, yeah, I was, I was bingeing listening to Dan [00:11:00] Martel and, and he was talking about if you do something twice. Make a checklist all about templates and it kind of, it, it kind of really, yeah, buy back your time, but it kind of really, really kind of is very similar to John's take on the world too.

That's, I was thinking on the way back. Yeah. But that concept of you do it twice. I mean, he would, he goes down to like packing business trip. He's got a checklist sitting there. Just so you know, I got the template I can pack in 10 minutes and go. So I don't know. Just, you know, same, same concept I think, but, uh, just affirmation or confirmation that, uh, the, the folks at that level, that's what they do.

**Athena:** This book is hands down one of the most impactful books I've read in my business journey. Um, so I, I think everybody's heard of like, who not how by now, you know, it's like. When we're in school, we're taught to figure out how do I do this myself? Right? You're not allowed to [00:12:00] cheat and work with anybody else.

You have to figure it out independently. So we're just trained our whole lives to have to figure everything out ourselves. So then who not how is like, oh, how do I find a person to solve this that knows how to solve this rather than me figuring out myself? But I loved the concept, but I did nothing with it for like years.

You know? I'm like, yeah, who, not how that's a great concept, but like, how do you actually do it? This book is the how to of who, not how. Um, and he like breaks down framework, systems, processes, everything. Um, and it, it's basically how to. Not only like pay someone to do things for you, but like how do you decide what to do, in what order or what frameworks do you use?

Um, he's got a hiring process, so we've actually implemented a lot of the components from his hiring process into our own hiring process. With the video cover letter, he's like, only 20% of people will do it and you know, then you can get a good [00:13:00] read on him in three minutes rather than trying to schedule a call and doing all the things.

And he is right. You don't have to sift through thousands of applications because when you ask them to do a video, like only 20% of 'em will actually go the extra step to do a video for you to, to apply for a role. It's absolute gold. Um, so it's something that I recommend, like, and I, I send it out when you become a new business owner too, because he actually has a framework for like the replacement ladder of how do you replace yourself in the business.

And he is like, every business that I buy, I also do this for whatever the owner was doing. So he has a systematic order for how you delegate certain things in the business out to other people. Like in what order. So it starts with the admin, um, then it's the delivery, then it's the marketing, then it's the sales, then it's a leadership strategy.

So if we're all thinking of how do we go from, you know, maybe the owner was super involved and spending 60 hours a week, but how do you actually decide what things you delegate in what order to get to that [00:14:00] coveted like passive owner status, you know? So, yeah, I will, I will rant all day long about buy back your time.

And Dan Martel, I actually sent it to Will from acquiring Mines too. I was like, dude, like, why are you answering your own emails right now? This is crazy. 

**Polly:** He is, um, Dan Martel. We were watching him one night on, uh, just on YouTube, and he had a couple of really great videos on, um, AI and how he uses ai. He's a, he's a great presenter.

He is a very, he's a very captivating guy, so he holds your attention very well. But, uh, yeah, I really, I, I found that all to be really interesting. 

**Athena:** Yeah, I've, I've seen him speak a couple times. Um, he, like, if you follow him on Instagram, he'll, like, he just randomly pops up in towns all the time and we'll do a talk and like give out free books and stuff like that.

Um, and then once a week, he, I think it's once a [00:15:00] week. In his, like hometown in Canada where he lives, he hosts a hike. So anyone that wants to can just show up and like do a hike with Dan. But you have to go to this like remote random town in Canada to be able to do it. So, um, yeah, this, I'm, I'm a like, tell me how to do something.

I'll try your framework and then I'll, I'll figure it out. But like a concept like who, not how, you know, I was like, where do you even get started? Like, I agreed with the concept of what do I do? So when I found this book, I was like, oh my God. It's like, okay, I'm bought into, I shouldn't be doing everything myself and this is like how to actually do it.

But Dan started, um, uh, he started doing investing into AI tech companies as well. Like, he's going hard into AI and a lot of the business minds that I listen to, I've been kind of getting obsessed with listening to. All the business leaders that I follow, like listening to their take on AI and what's coming and like, [00:16:00] is it utopia?

Is it dystopia? Like are we at Word with China? Is China actually friendly? And like how layers into the economy, inflation, everything. So, um, but there's no doubt that AI is definitely, um, a really interesting space for all of us to consider and especially looking at the businesses. So, yeah. Fun stuff. Cool.

Well, um, I was wondering, so Justin, I haven't heard an update from you, but I was, I know you get a couple live ones. Any, any movement on those? 

**Justin:** Um, I got a little, um, I have feedback from the roofing broker. Uh, apparently we're gonna talk this afternoon. I'm really not sure what the feedback was. It was a little, it was weird.

Um, mm-hmm. It. He basically said, uh, let me know if you're interested in pursuing this further. And they were, I think this was a [00:17:00] templated response to prospective buyers where they were, um, basically stating like, he's had a really good June, which wasn't a part of the nu like I didn't have those numbers when I submitted the original ice through like T 12 May.

And he said, uh, you know, let us know if you want to evaluate the, or like what you wanna do. And, and I think the subtext though, he never actually said it in the email. There's a long email calling out June numbers, here's their receivables. What they were doing is like, if you wanna change your offer, basically like up your offer, but he knows my offer included a caveat or, or a component that accounted for a change in EBITDA that I was like, here's what we would do in that case.

And the EBITDA change, if I'm reading his numbers correctly, are like. $8,000 more than what I proposed anyway in the trailing truck. So I'm like, I don't, what are we talking about? Like, are we doing this? Are we, you know why? 

**Athena:** Right. 

**Justin:** So I'm gonna talk to 'em, hopefully on the call and, and, uh, and see [00:18:00] what that means, because I, they, this seems, it's, it's starting to get a little squishy where they're just, it's like they don't want commit.

Mm-hmm. Because they keep wanting to see what each subsequent month is going to do to his business. And I said, well, that's exactly why I've got the points in the LOI right. That, that accommodate what happens should the EBITDA change up or down? It's like, so I don't, like, if we agree to the terms and we're good with that, then we can keep moving forward.

Nothing has to, you know, it's not gonna fundamentally or materially change the LOI. So anyway, I'm confused. We'll find out what sounds 

**Athena:** like they're still dating then. 

**Justin:** Could be. 

**Polly:** Could be. Yeah. 

**Justin:** Yeah. Or they're, they're using this as like a lure to see who else is, you know. In the mix. And you know, I, I'm, I don't know, I'm getting to a point with this one where it's just like, I, like, I don't wanna keep this going forever.

This whole like back and forth and back and forth and back and forth and it's like either we have terms we're agreeing to or not, we keep dialing it in the scope's getting more and more [00:19:00] specific and finite with responses. And I'm accommodating where I can, where it makes sense. There's a point where we're just gonna be like, look, here's the deadline.

Like, if you want it or you don't, or like, you know what I mean? Like, then we're not gonna keep this back and forth indefinitely 'cause it's just I got too much else going on to, you know, keep that, that game in motion. But, um, anyway, but he's still friendly. I mean, everything's still very po like friendly and, you know, this is just kind of in my internal monologue.

**Athena:** I would um, I would put him on the spot for next steps. 

**Justin:** Yeah, I mean, that's basically what I'm gonna do. 

**Athena:** I would just say like, Hey, I'm a little confused. I thought we were negotiating this directly. It sounds like you're talking to other people, so like what's, what's your next move here? Like, how are you guys deciding?

When are you deciding, like, yeah, I kind of put my offer out to you twice now. Um, so like, [00:20:00] what's, what's the decision process look like in your timing, you know? Yeah. 

**Justin:** Yeah. I mean, I, I might get to a point where if they won't, I mean, I'll do that and if they don't commit or they won't commit to what that is, then I may just have to like, pull my head from the ring.

I'll just be like, then I, you know, I've got too much else to focus on right now. I can't keep doing this. Um, but we'll see. Like I said, it's not, it's not dead by any stretch. Um, it's just. I don't know what the status is, but, we'll, we'll find out when I talk to the broker. Well, I'll just 

**Athena:** be like, what's missing that you're not signing right now?

You know, like, you've got my offer. We've been talking about that. I didn't know you were talking to other people. It sounds like you are, like, what's, what's, what's the seller holding out for right now? 'cause 

**Justin:** yeah, 

**Athena:** he hasn't signed any of 'em. 

**Justin:** Yeah, I, I mean, I, my gut is probably, if I'm, my read is right, it's that he is, he's working diligently to make, he, he had that dip [00:21:00] in, in the first half and so he is working diligently to come out of it.

He knows what these storms coming through, he's capitalizing and that's affecting to his benefit, the valuation or, or the ebitda and therefore the valuation based on multiple. So I think he is like kind of baiting and trying to like buy time so that he can have this on paper to then make the business more attractive and, and ideally increase offers or get better offers.

That's. That's my read. It's probably what's happening. Um, which is fine, and exactly why. Again, I put that like asterisk, like, okay, cool, if the EBITDA changes we for the better, we'll deduct that proportionately from the seller's note, the performance component, like so, and vice versa. Like either way, like we've got, I've got that written in there.

So I don't know what, I don't know. I don't know what, what's going on. Like I said, I'm confused 

**Athena:** there. Yeah. There's a reason he is not signing, so I just, I would, yeah, I would, you know, a just, I feel, I feel a [00:22:00] little bit messed around, right? Like, 

**Polly:** yeah, so what's 

**Athena:** going on? Like, how can we button this up? Or what's, what's not happening?

What's missing for him? Why is he not signing it? Um. And I would, you know, just be like, I got a couple other really great deals in play, so I, I need to start choosing at this point. So you kind of take it away from 'em, you know? Yeah. I don't know if I would like pull your hat out, right. Because it still is a really exciting deal, but I would just be like, look, I, I've gotta start focusing my efforts.

I would love for it to be with you guys, but I thought we were close and it doesn't sound like we are. Yeah. So, you know, 

**Justin:** that's, that's the, the lever I was gonna pull next was like, look, I've got other businesses I'm deeply evaluating and I'm, you know, and I haven't used that with them yet. Like, I haven't mentioned that.

'cause I just didn't think it warranted it in the conversation. But there will be a point where it's just like, I am looking at other things, so I'm gonna need to make my own decision shortly if this is going to be a part of that consideration or [00:23:00] not. 

**Athena:** Yeah. I like what Renan said when he visited us and he is like, look, I wanna buy a business.

I don't know if it's your business. So you could kind of use a spin on that. Like, look, I want to buy a business. I would like it to be this business, but I've got other options and it, it doesn't feel like you guys are, are choosing me or, you know. Yeah. Move forward. So like, what's missing and is there something we can talk about at this point?

If not, you know, like, but I would ask before you get to that point, like, what's the decision process and the timeline? Because it, I thought we were closer and now it feels like we're further away, so what's happening? 

**Justin:** Yeah. I mean, I, they keep changing their own goalposts, so I don't know if they know, like they had this hard deadline before.

Well, that came and went and then they had a second deadline in less formal on this second go around that came and went. Like, you know, so I, they just keep, yeah, they're, I don't know if they [00:24:00] will commit to a standard at some point. Um, you know, I don't know. 

**Athena:** Got it. Um, but. Any movement on the financing piece or the other deal?

**Justin:** The, uh, I haven't heard back about the sp alternative stuff. You mean with like Stonehenge? I, I think I sent the some material to Matt. So he is, he is reviewing, um, probably touch base this week, I'm sure. Um, and then, uh, the other deal, the, yeah, the coworking space actually we're back from the broker today.

Uh, you know, he, he had, has not presented it at this point to the seller, but he was evaluating it, you know, just kind of reviewing it and gave me some feedback that he, how he thinks it'll be received and he thinks it's gonna be low, um, that, you know, my offer is too aggressive or, you know, in my favor, what have you.

Um, so he asked a couple, you know, points around there. I kind of, I didn't hold [00:25:00] like too firm, but I, I mean, I, I made I think very valid points as to why it was structured, the way it's structured. Um. You know, most notably for three years running, there's been decreasing revenue systematically 15% year over year, if not closer to 20%, a couple years.

Um, and he said he didn't like, he didn't think that my multiple offer would be strong enough. And I'm like, well, you can't command a premium for a decreasing declining business. Like I, you know, I don't know what else to tell you, like, or I'm not gonna pay a premium multiple for declining business. Um, if that should change, fine.

But, um, and then I said, you know, that's where I leaned kind of into the same thing that we said for the, uh, roofing business. That's like, the reason the performance note is in there is to just get levels back to where they were 20, 23, not even 22, which is was the best year. 23 was a down year, 22 or, uh, 24 was an even mo further down year.

So I said, if we can align incentives to get back to 23 numbers, then we both [00:26:00] win. And so I go, and that's how I can offer, you know, a, a larger multiple. Um, I just don't think they like that multiple. I think they're still trying to fig, like command a premium and, and I had a feeling that might be the case because again, they're not, this isn't a desperation sale.

There's no urgent, like they're not, he's like, I'll just hold onto it if I have to. So, which is fine. So maybe it's just we can't, we don't get to that point. But I did talk through some of the, um, rationale there. He goes, okay, this helps. He goes, well, let me get feedback from the seller and I'll get back to you.

So that's kind of where we are now with that. Okay, 

**Athena:** cool. Well, um, look forward to diving in deeper. Anything else? You said you're chatting with the broker today on hometown? 

**Justin:** Uh, yeah. Yeah, we're supposed to chat today. Um, oh, good. I 

**Athena:** look forward so we can, we can catch up on that tomorrow and see where that's at.

Oh 

**Justin:** yeah. He's so busy doing his like empire little roofing brokerage empire that he is just like, he said, Hey, let's talk at one. I said, Hey, we good. We talk at one. He goes, no, let's talk later. So he's like, [00:27:00] he is like going. A million directions. Um, but we'll, we'll see if I can actually get 'em on the line.

**Athena:** Cool. Awesome. Thanks Justin. We'll check tomorrow. Um, Gil, I, I think you have an interesting one that you're gonna be, it's an on market, but the sellers selling themselves, and it sounded like you have a call coming up. Have you thought through strategy for that one? Would it be worth 

**Gil:** talking 

**Athena:** about 

**Gil:** that one 

**Athena:** bit?

**Gil:** Um, it would be, but however, I have a hard stop in like three minutes. 

**Athena:** Oh no, that's tomorrow 

**Gil:** morning when we, when, when we meet. Uh, but yeah, I have few thoughts in my mind about, uh, what I want to ask him and how I want to approach, how I want to approach, especially after listening to the call that looped in with him.

He sounds very onic, very straight to the point, very one word answer kind of person. So I just need to approach that correctly. Mm. 

**Athena:** Yeah. Might be some mirroring if, uh, it's directly with the seller there, so, yeah. Excited to talk [00:28:00] about that. Um, sorry I didn't pick on you earlier then, but we can, we can chat through it tomorrow, so.

Awesome. Um, cool. Well, Steve and Polly, I know you've got some new stuff coming up and we've closed out everything else, or is there anything else live that you're working on that would be worth chatting through? 

**Polly:** I think really that, you know, we, we just decided no on the franchise and, um, of course we, we went through that whole process with you on Wednesday and, and sometimes prior that.

**Steve:** Yeah. Do you wanna call you back or try that have another meeting? 

**Polly:** What's that? Yeah, so I received an email from the broker, um, that I'm bringing it up right now, um, in my email just to make sure that I, I, uh. Read it off correctly. I remember it exactly the way he put it. Casey asked if you were open to a call with him, who is the owner, wanted to see if he could get you [00:29:00] past the franchise concerns.

I know he was kind of pulling for you to throw in an offer. So that was basically Steve and I saying the offer that they received wasn't the offer he ended up liking, wanting or the guy pulled it or who knows. But it doesn't sound to me like there's probably anything else on the table for him right now.

**Athena:** Yeah, I mean that was some pretty, and it might be worth sharing with the group and the reporting just in case anybody else considers franchises. But there was some pretty material like numbers that would be different for you as the owner based on what they were sharing. And they weren't including all the, the fees and everything.

Correct. Um, so there was a lot of detective work that y'all had to do of comparing the three different locations and, and all of that. So, um, I, [00:30:00] yeah, it doesn't sound like they have a lot and probably because you went so far down the process, they're like, wait, no, don't go. So are, are you still wanting to leave it alone or is that, is that making you want to be open to a 

**Steve:** call?

How are 

**Athena:** you feeling 

**Steve:** about that? We're like, we we're done with it. So, okay. Such a mess. Move on Justin, for, I think you're on the call still for your, just, just, uh, lessons learned. There is three different, uh, franchises. They had three different p and ls. Uh, if when you start lining up the expenses, it's a franchise, everything should match up.

Every expense should be a line item on everything. Some places call it this. Some places were different. Some it was missing. Uh, so how do you have a, a franchise store that doesn't have a franchise fee and then you're trying to evaluate the whole picture. But basically one of the three stores was doing 75 or 80% of the revenue, but he is trying to.

Put 'em all together. And by the time, just, just, uh, they probably had a [00:31:00] spreadsheet all created, just trying to line up what is what. So I think the, the main store was absorbing some of the expenses from the other stores, so it made it look better on paper. And I guess we didn't even talk about some of the add back stuff that we couldn't figure out too.

So there was, there was a lot of different, we, we couldn't, we couldn't figure, and, and the, the main store, uh, that, that, um, that, that they had, he was moving only 10 minutes away, but it's the only one that's working. So now you're buying a new location. You know, why not just buy into the franchise and patrol location up at that point?

So we kinda, it was just such a mess. It was a great ex, great learning experience. And I think all of us that go into this have been warned and think about, you know, think twice about franchises and, uh, so we said, let, let's just play this, let's play the cards out and see what happens anyway. And it's, you know, interesting business.

Oh, and to boot the, uh, founder, uh, this, this was the founder of the franchise's [00:32:00] stores himself, and he's not, doesn't have three flagships stores that are really crushing it, but he's spending more time on selling the franchises at this point. So it was really kind of one of those, yeah, it was really good pushups to go through all the exercise of trying to figure out the financials.

You get better at it. But, uh, I think we just kind of said, yeah, this is really too complex and not, and, and there was another, um, offer, I think it was a Doctor outta Tampa. Wanted to buy it. And so he, he had an LOI that he submitted and apparently when we just turned it down, apparently that LOI wasn't really a solid LLOI, so, uh, or maybe it was, there was no LOI, who knows.

**Athena:** Just, I mean, I, I, I keep laughing. I am like, it's kind of like the, those who can't do teach, like those who can't run businesses, start franchises. Like what, uh, I, my [00:33:00] mind just boggles. And also being someone like that's done licensing and, and franchising in the past and my businesses and for Guinness World Records, you know, there was so much integrity with what we did and we had, we felt like we really needed to nail it and, and get the model right and thriving before we started handing it over to people.

Um, so, but to, to move. The high performer, 10 minutes away, mid sale. I, I, the mind boggles, like, I just, I wish it's like the unsolved mysteries. It's gonna be like rolling in my head. Like, why would you do that? Why is he doing that? What on earth would you be like, Hey, let me take this store that's like holding up the other two stores and just move it 10 minutes down the road and sell, like, sell it, you know, and do that in the middle of a sale.

I, 

**Polly:** um, 

**Steve:** yeah, I don't know. Ahead. Go ahead Paul. Mm-hmm. 

**Polly:** I still come back to it [00:34:00] doesn't matter what kind of business that you have, if you're selling a product, you know you want to be the face of that product. You want it to be a great product, something that you use, something that you, that you're promoting and you know, it can be, it can be truly mapped back to you.

Using it, let's say it's even like a skincare product or what have you. Hey, I'm, I'm using this, this is doing great things for me. And it's evident that it is. I could never get past the fact, I'm like, why would a franchisor of all of these other brands and this brand not have those three stores be like his showcase stores?

**Athena:** Yeah. Well, and you know, that's the thing. It's like, as a package, the numbers looked good, it looked attractive. Like he went to the, the store locally and it looked, you know, she was happy and it looked good. Um, you know, I liked that there was three separate p and [00:35:00] ls, but when, like if you're running three separate p and Ls, you should be having the true expenses for every single store, even if one store's paying it.

Like make sure you're mapping that over to the p and ls of the other store and like how that got missed to not have all the true franchise fees is part of the, I think we got there in the end that it was part of the SDE calculation, but it wasn't on the p and ls and everything. So, um, yeah, I don't know.

On the surface, on the surface it looked like it could be a really interesting business. Right? Yeah. So it's like, this is, this is why we go through this process of like really digging into the numbers and meeting the owners and even doing the location visit is because you got information that you wouldn't have necessarily gotten otherwise.

So I think he did a good job of, of running this down 'cause it was a little bit of a. Like three of the locations and the PNLs and Polly did her forensic accounting on the p and ls. It was awesome. So well done on, on all [00:36:00] that. I think this, this would go in your CEO notebook of like all the things you learned.

Oh yeah. I was just 

**Polly:** thinking about that when John's suggestion of basically journaling your business, uh, your business journey. And this would de this is definitely one to journal 

**Steve:** for sure. I think, I think you're used to this Athena, but you know, for, for me, the, the. C comedic value of dealing with some of these owners is just so interesting.

Like we looked at that waterfront, uh, in Destin, that, uh, property that, that did all the, uh, renting out the boats. And in mid cycle of selling it, he decides, I'm gonna put a little restaurant on the property. Like, where are you coming from? You're selling your business. I'm just gonna drop a restaurant here.

Or Paul, you didn't say anything, Athena, but was it yesterday or the day before? If you remember the catering lady who had the, she came back 

**Polly:** to me. She sent me a text. She sent me a text. Oh really? What'd she say? 

**Steve:** She really, she really wants us to buy her business. And this is the one who [00:37:00] had, remember she had the, the Chinese landlord or who, who she got deported and she has to like drop money in an envelope.

So sorry. And I'm like, what in the world? But I guess that's, that's part of a lot of these small, it's 

**Polly:** part of it. Um. She said, I'm reaching out to see if you have any interest in purchasing Simpl Catering. I'm open to a reasonable offer. You would not have to be present at the kitchen every day. I went there once this week for about an hour.

We had nine jobs this week and it all went smoothly. Our staff is very competent and need little direction. I am in communication with them a few times a day. We communicate through emails and text. My sister Steph, who's the chef and I are working to work, uh, willing to work six months to implement a smooth transaction.

Salary's negotiable. If you would like to set a time to talk and ask questions, let me know. Thank you for cons considering this purchase. So she reached out to me and I responded to her really quickly [00:38:00] and, um, I think I was really kind about it. I just, you know, said I, that I appreciate. Um, you reaching out to us for further consideration, but we no longer have an interest in the catering and food service category.

I sincerely hope you find a buyer that is the right fit for Simply Catering. We wish you and your sister the very best. And she had thanked me for my quick response and that was it. Aw, 

**Athena:** that's sweet. But yeah, I, I always, I always laugh when those things happen 'cause it like the, the ex that comes back, you know that person that you dated that's like two and you're like, what are you, what?

Like, um, but sometimes they come back and you want 'em, right? Or situations changed or the thing that was like a, a deal breaker. They go away and work on it, and then they come back to you and, Hey, we fixed that thing. So I, I've heard that time and time again of deal coming back, you know, and, and, um, we actually had that with one of our early clients, like two different deals ended up coming back [00:39:00] after we lost them.

And, um, I mean. Shoot, even, even Justin thought that was lost and now you're negotiating all that. It sounds like you're negotiating with other people. But, um, yeah, I was nearly in tears laughing when they told me the asking price on the three franchises. So like, I can't remember exactly what it was, but Steve's like, should we, should we get a clip of Athena?

Like hysterically laughing, like, 

**Steve:** here's our answer. We have, we're we're just gonna send our consultant as our answer in laughing her butt off on, on video right now. There's like four point whatever million dollars and Yeah, then you start adding it up, you're like, whoa, this is like, they're, anyway, whatever.

That's bygones and, but it's, it's all learning experience. That's what I'm learning. There is some comedic value in it, um, along the way, but I think we're getting better at understanding that, you know, there's gonna be something in every deal that you're gonna go through. And just, you know, what can you live with?

And quite frankly, if we really were [00:40:00] interested in the catering business, this could have been something that would've been great for us because now the, now we've got the, you know, instead of them fronting that, Hey, we want this, well, here's what we're willing to do. So yeah, now we're in our terms. It's just not the right business and, you know, for multiple reasons.

**Athena:** Yeah. No, that's cool. Um, well, good stuff. So, um, I know you've got a, a new one that you're gonna start looking at. So excited to hear about that one. Um, yes. Cool. Well, awesome. Um, I don't have anyone else to pick on today, so unless anyone has any burning questions or topics that you wanna talk through, might give you 14 minutes back.

Oh, wait, wait, wait. Let me, let me plug Thursday. So Elliot Hollands coming back on Thursday and I've asked him to do financial statements 1 0 1. Um, so balance sheets, p and Ls, and y'all were either there or watched his sessions, so he makes them really interactive. So I would [00:41:00] definitely block out your calendars and come to that one because I'm, I'm still learning about financial statements even though I've looked at so many of 'em and he's certainly looked at so many of them doing qv.

So, and I thought, who better than Elliot to do a really fun one-on-one topic, on something that's a little bit of a. Brain melt and also not that fun of a topic normally. So, um, I would not miss that one. I think it's gonna be a lot of fun, uh, and, and educational, which you learn better when you're having fun, I think.

Um, so can we use our three p and l statements from the franchise? Look at those. Oh yeah. Maybe I'll ask him, uh, like have a, have some statements. I'm kidding. I'm kidding. But, well, no, um, he, he's, he's, he would, I I, I would guess he's probably gonna be interactive like he was last time. So any questions that you have about financial statements or how to review 'em, um, would, if we get time, you know, just kind of looking at work in [00:42:00] progress, accounts receivable, that sort of thing.

But I really wanna focus on p and ls and, and balance sheets actually, 'cause I don't think we spend enough time talking about those and what to dig into there. So come with all of your questions around financial statements or things that you've come up with before. And if you have those examples, Polly like.

Well, I bet we'll have some time that, you know, we can pull 'em up and, and chat through some things there. 

**Steve:** Two things, if, I don't know if it's in scope of the conversation or not, but two things that I personally struggle with just in my head is, number one is working capital. Mm-hmm. And number two is add backs.

So while you have financial statements, okay, now where do we go to really make this a true statement that we can work off of from a true valuation. 

**Polly:** Yeah. I'm gonna, I'm gonna second that. Those actually are two ones that I would've brought up as well, so, 

**Athena:** okay, 

**Justin:** cool. Um, Paul had, I'll third it. Why not? 

**Athena:** Okay.[00:43:00] 

Awesome. So, um, we'll start with, um. L is a balance statement and balance sheets and then how to determine working capital's. A little bit difficult with those two statements, but add-backs for sure. Um, in terms of like what's a legitimate add-back or not, or how he views add-backs. So I'll give him that brief and see what he can do with that and pull out some magic.

Maybe we'll just do a separate working capital discussion. Um, 'cause I don't think you can have enough conversations about that. And now that we, we have some past buyers clubs recordings with um, Chris talking through working capital, but now that you have more deal experience, it's like, oh, okay, now I can actually wrap my head around it and, and sink my teeth into it that I've had more deals that I've looked at.

So, um, good, these are good topics because I have to book more buyers clubs. So any other topics? That would be of interest or [00:44:00] useful to you all that either we've covered in the past and you'd love to revisit or things we haven't covered yet?

**Steve:** I'd have to give some thought. I mean, I'm personally, I'm geeking out on trying to learn how to build, uh, AI agents right now, so. Um, 

**Athena:** as are 

**Steve:** we. It's just, you know, it's, it's, it's, it's another one of those things that is simple, but not easy. Yeah. Because it's a simple concept. But, you know, the, the programming I did was, I think the last time I actually wrote code was in 1986 or something like that, 87.

So that code is like the ancient stuff. They've replaced like 10 times over already. Uh, but the, you know, the, the idea of, you know, taking just, and just on a personal basis to even organize, like, when we look at a deal, how can we do it faster, better, and everything else? So, and I think whatever, learn the learning process, 'cause it's coming no matter what, whether you like it or not, it's coming.

Either you embrace it or you gonna let be left [00:45:00] behind. So I'm, I'm, I'm thinking about it. I need to understand the concept and I need to build some myself so I understand what really goes behind the design and everything else. Because when we do buy a business, the first thing I'm gonna do is say, okay, what can we do and automate through AI agents, uh, as a strategy.

So that's, whether it's around marketing, content, uh, advertising, billing, whatever it is. But I, I'm just taking some stuff that doesn't matter if I blow it up, it doesn't matter. Uh, but that's kind of where I'm geeking out on. And so maybe a session on, you know, the future of small business and ai, how to incorporate it.

And I see John, Justin, Justin with some thoughts. I 

**Justin:** could see him squirming over there. 

**Athena:** Yeah, I, 

**Justin:** I agree. I mean, I, I work in AI with my job, my day job. I mean, we sell AI enabled data, um, to enterprise companies and fortune companies. So I, I mean, I'm, I'm in agent AI tools, not as much personally, but certainly professionally, just with [00:46:00] work all the time.

And, uh, but I, I absolutely leverage everything I can, you know, for my own needs, uh, when possible as well. I was actually just mulling over some ideas, um, for that I, that have been mulling in my head around where I could bone up or, or like more insight. And, um, but one of them is, and I don't even know exactly how to articulate this, but almost like role play scenarios in modeling based around criteria that you uncover through diligence or through the research in the diligence process.

So case in point, like. I hear a lot of like, well, you've gotta account for those things and you gotta, you gotta make sure that's in the model. But I wanna hear people, it's like, here's what we did to account for that and still move forward. For example, I'm meeting with, uh, Luke has brought, uh, one of the newer opportunities, so I'm speaking with the broker right after this, actually here in a few minutes.

Um, but they have like a 90% customer concentration in one customer [00:47:00] that scares the bejesus outta me. That was, had, had been the number one non-starter in my book for all criteria that could, you know, t an opportunity like this. But I'm meeting with them 'cause maybe there's something creative. I don't know.

I don't know what I don't know. So I'm going to talk it out. We'll see, you know, the nature of that relationship, it sounds like it is very relationship driven. So there's a lot of flags already kind of going into this. But 

**Athena:** yeah, 

**Justin:** what I would love to hear is like scenarios where someone moved forward with the business or whatever and said, here's how we accounted for that.

Here's what we did in how we structure the deal, how we. Worked through transition, how we, you know, diversified or whatever their solution was going to be and how they executed that post transit. And I'm just using customer concentration. It's like one example, but you get the idea. It's like all of these hangups that we see, whether it's customers concentration, another one I'm looking at Keyman risk.

The guy is the brand. He is the brand and he's leaving. It's like, okay. They're [00:48:00] like, how do you, what did you do? Or what did this person do to successfully overcome that? In structuring a safeguarded deal? But then also if and when they close, then what did they do to implement, you know, to actually, because I, you know, there's so much that we learn around buying the business, but then we actually have to run the thing when it's all said and done.

So I would love a little insight into how that red thread kind of connects from the structure to the execution, at least in the like early days post-transition. 

**Steve:** And I'm, does that make sense to pile on your, your, your thoughts right there? So, I, so I'm, I'm also in big tech, right? We do a lot of ai, you know, the, the platform is kind of built on AI and I do, I sell AI governance and all that good stuff.

But what's so interesting is like, there's the promise and then there's a reality. Like, you know, for example, even internally in our internal system where we can ask, uh, you know, an assist, uh, chat to go ahead and pull what I need from internal documents. And I asked a real [00:49:00] basic question that gave you a bunch of fluff back.

Like, I gotta go to Chatt PD to find out more than my own company's got on the data that's already in, there's connected. So, what's kind of reality, if anybody, if you, if you come across Athena, anybody who is actually doing something with AI in the small business, where's the low hanging fruit? Because there's the art of the possible.

There's so many things. We can do with it, but what is, you know, where's the low hanging fruit when you walk in to say, Hey, you can sure up here's some, here's some, you know, we talk, you know, we talk about the concept all the time. Find an old, stodgy, boring businesses on paper and pencil and put some technology to it.

Well, AI is like the ultimate next level generation of technology. Where can we land? And it might just be using. A, you know, ai, if they've got some kind of an email list and, and putting advertisements around to an email, whatever, whatever the case may be, just kind of practical stuff instead of all the Instagram and YouTube Promise world stuff.

Yeah. That's just my, my view. And, and you know, [00:50:00] so, but yeah, how do we, how do we make it useful? 'cause like Justin said, we're gonna take over our business and we're be like, now what? Even, even using AI to build, you know, take what John's doing and saying, okay, you gotta get these, these systems and playbooks down and how can we use AI from, you know, even if you're walking around a little recorder and saying, Hey, tell me how we do this stuff.

Get the recording, drop it in, do, do some generative AI to summarize it, and then, then do some agent AI to build, rebuild the process. So to pull it, you know, so it never, I guess, you know, there's so many things, but, but you know, that's like way out here. Where can we go in and like, bam, that's a win right away.

**Athena:** Well, uh, so. I, as you're talking, I'm like, God, there is so much that me and the team are doing that could translate to business. So we can, we can also pull out like, well here's, here's the tools that we use to help us because, you know, we're a small but like highly [00:51:00] productive team, right? And that's because we we're very tech forward in the background.

So my philosophy around it is how do, how do I use tech to replace the, the things that I don't need a specialty human for to create a better human experience? So behind the scenes, the monotonous admin things that actually is better served by tech, because as a human, you get tired and bored, right? Where tech doesn't get bored and they work 24 hours a day, but.

The interactions and the consultative part, and the intuition and the eq, that, that AI is just not there, right? Like it doesn't create context. It needs context. Um, so we use AI so many ways, but I can't, I don't even know how many Athena Botts there are now that the team have created. Like, that's funny.

That's great. How would Athena respond? Because a lot of our, our outreach is done as me, right? So it's like, how would [00:52:00] Athena respond? What's a Athena would say about this? So, um, yeah, we could probably, you ever consult with 

**Steve:** Athena Bott yourself? What's that? Do you ever consult with the Athena bot yourself?

No. 

**Athena:** Maybe I should, I should get access to it and be like, what would I do in this situation? But I just thought it was so funny because the, the, the, the team started building Athena bots and, and they would run the outputs by me. But I, I can even do a case study for how we used ai. And if you're going into a new business, like how can you use AI to help your team do better and, you know, not have to run every single decision past you because you're, you're, I review the outputs and I'm like, okay, now I feel I'm confident that the outputs are as good as I would want to see, and now y'all can fly off.

So there's a, a way in which we do it that I have oversight, I review it and then I'm like, okay, I'm good with it. Team can run with it. Right? So, um, yeah, but I like the idea of getting [00:53:00] AI experts in and the low hanging fruit. And how would you incorporate AI at a basic level in some of these businesses that have absolutely nothing?

So that gives me a lot of fun topics to think about for the future. 'cause it, it is something that we all need to be thinking about and my gosh, like between, um, offshoring certain roles, right? And getting exceptional talent, um, outside of the us. Um. And ai, I think there's a lot of opportunities with, with businesses.

Any, any business there. So, 

**Steve:** um, disruption too. 'cause the people that the employees there, they are not AI people, nor will they probably ever be. So how do you go in there and actually help them do more interesting things and not scare the heck out of 'em? Like, my job has gone. So I think part of it is, yes, we'd like to make money, but we're also kind of in that camp of we appreciate, uh, that, you know, the small business [00:54:00] community and how do you lift it up instead of shred it like a private equity would do.

**Athena:** No, it's, um, it's, these are great topic ideas. Um, good luck on the call Justin. Um, and really excited for Thursday. So I hope y'all can make it with Elliot that is Sure. To be one, not to miss. Um, and 

**Polly:** excited to talk to y'all. Oh yeah, go for it. More thought on the AI thing that I'm just sitting here thinking about like systems improving and, and everything, let's call it back of the house.

Um, improving systems, making that customer experience better. But I also think that there's an element that we're missing, um, nowadays, especially where the human element of, of actually taking care of the customer, whether it's somebody offshore that you're using that person's talent for that, or you're doing it yourself, depending on how bus, how big your business is.

I think back to a time when, [00:55:00] when. You were su, you were providing customer service to a client or to a customer, and you made sure that they were taken care of completely instead of just saying, okay, this is my, this is my box here. This is the only thing that I'm supposed to do, so you know, I'm gonna pass you off to this person, or this person, or this person.

So improving those systems, yes. I think that there's gonna be a huge focus, though, in my opinion. There's so many people that are so ticked off with customer experience now with all, all different kinds of companies and all different industries that I think we're gonna have to look at that from a human perspective because you'll never, ever completely use that, lose that human.

That human touch or that human perspective. And I think people, a lot of people are just honestly really pissed off with their experiences with companies. 

**Athena:** Oh, well, if you've been in my house the last couple days, [00:56:00] my poor boyfriend trying to move his number from one service provider to another, and it's been 20 hours, he drove three hours away to a store.

Like all sorts of, and it's just an absolute nightmare. So, I don't know if you've heard me say this before, but I think in, in addition to ai, like the real, um. Valuable businesses in the future are gonna be the ones that do exceptional concierge human interactions with people. Agreed. Right? Yeah. Um, and that, that's how we're building this business.

It's like how do we use technology behind the scenes to enable that exceptional concierge, human level experience? So like, you're not dealing with ai because I am pissed off. Like every time I get one of 'em, I'm like, agent human. You know, like I'm just screaming at it. Yeah. I don't even wanna deal with this thing right now.

But it does empower all of us to do so much more when like the way and the teams actually [00:57:00] building, we're calling it the Oracle right now. So that's a second brain of like retaining all of the client information. Um, you know, the industries, that sort of thing to do that first level filtering that actually, you know, the humans that we have are very good at it, but we'd be able to do more faster and probably more accurate by not having the monotonous work done by humans and having it done by something that we could train for that, um, which then makes the humans happier because they're not doing the monotonous, boring, like brain melting stuff.

And, and I did everything in this business before we hired all these exceptional humans. And it's, it, it's, there's some mind melting stuff that like we can do so much more and better on that human level if we use tech to replace some of the things that I don't think humans need to do. Right. And you would, right.

If anything, you'd perceive a better experience because we'll, we'll be able to improve some of those behind the scenes processes. Right? Yeah. [00:58:00] Um, I think it's a great, that gives me so much to think about. I feel like offshoring would be a fun topic too. Like, um, definitely because I have a lot of opinions about it on doing it well and not doing it well.

Where to source from and how to, you know, create a culture around it and all that sort of stuff. So, um, that could be another fun one. 'cause that can be a real, you know, um, game changer to help your onshore team to get them a really exceptional like offshore support system, which we, we have here. So. 

**Steve:** Yeah, that's awesome.

You, you can teach us how to get our, we're not offshore. The, the people are great. We're the problem because we gotta, we don't put the systems in place to and transfer what we want done. That's, that's not an easy thing to do. So you end up just doing it yourself. And, uh, so yeah, I would love to hear your thoughts on that.

**Athena:** Yeah. Well, I mean, we don't, we don't view, and, and this was something I learned kind of early on, is like everyone you hire is, is part of the [00:59:00] company. It's not like this team is treated differently than this one or anything like everyone. Is part of the company and they're treated, you know, the same, um, nobody's above anyone unless there's an actual like management reporting structure and that sort of thing.

So building that kind of culture, but, um, making sure that you're hiring from cultures that are all gonna get each other and, you know, um, I've, I've studied this a lot in terms of other people doing things and um, you know, we won't source in certain parts of the world 'cause I don't think it's a good quality of life and that sort of thing.

So I have a lot to say there that we could pull in. And, um, and I know somebody who's an amazing speaker on that, so maybe I can get him to come and talk too.

Cool. Awesome. Well, good stuff. I'm excited to hear, uh, more tomorrow. So, um, I know Luke's on deck to get you that writeup, so we'll have something to talk about there if, uh, that that comes through in time. [01:00:00] 

**Steve:** Thank 

**Polly:** you. Sounds good. We'll talk about it. Hopefully tomorrow we'll have a chance to, I'll have a chance to review it.

Um, 

**Steve:** are you around tomorrow afternoon? I can't remember. 

**Polly:** Um, yes I am. I'm gonna, I'm gonna be gone some of the day tomorrow for some coaching stuff that I'm doing tomorrow. Um, but I'll be back and, and time for our meeting. I should be Okay. 

**Athena:** Great. We'll see you both tomorrow. Thanks so much. Have a good night.

Thank you. 

**Polly:** You too. Bye. 

Bye.
