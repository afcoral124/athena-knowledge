[00:00:00]
Athena: Hello. Hello. Amazing. Hey, Kyle. Welcome to your first Buyers Club. Hey, Steve, Lisa—one, uh, even though Molly is the name. So welcome to your first Buyers Club.

Um, so super excited to have you all today. This is a special Buyers Club where I get to shut up and you get to hear from the amazing people that are on the front lines, uh, doing all the good work of sourcing deals and talking with brokers. Last week we went to the Texas Association of Business Brokers Annual Conference.

Um, Texas has one of the largest, um, associations as far as states go for brokerages. Um, and it is an unlicensed state, so it's a really interesting place where it's a bunch of independent brokers, but they created an association. A lot of the problems that they had 40 years ago seem to still be the problems now.

But the reason why we go to this event is not just to create relationships, it's to get a really good representative sample size of what's happening in broker land and in on-market. Um, every year it's shifting, especially with the popularity of business buying. Uh, this group was absolutely not prepared for the internet, so it is delightful to go and hear all the things that are happening.

But also these are folks that have been doing, um, business transactions for 20, 30, sometimes 40 years. So they have a lot of really sage wisdom and on a lot of the deals, they are the ones, uh, you know, holding the opportunities that we're looking at. So this was a research project for us as much as anything.

So, uh, Luke and Charis and Cash are going to be sharing their insights, takeaways that they took from that event and how we're gonna be enacting that as a business, but also things for you to be aware of, um, going into broker deals, uh, and how that shifts and how you can, you know, stand out and be even more competitive than we set you up to be anyway.

So, um, this is a fun one for me 'cause I get to shut up and listen to the amazing people that actually do the work out there. Um, so I'm gonna be handing over to Cash to start and you're gonna be hearing from each of 'em. So, um, we'll be recording this, but, you know, take notes, ask questions. We'll have a discussion at the end too.

Um, or we'll have time for discussion at the end. But if you have any questions or thoughts as we go through this, please feel free to jump in at the end. Um, so Cash, over to you.

[00:03:00]
Cash: Awesome. Super excited to hop on and appreciate the, uh, introduction and handover, Athena.

Super, uh, fun time. Awesome for us to be able to connect. Uh, I think a lot of the importance for us being able to dive in and understand the broker industry is a lot of the same practices that I know at least I walk through with my clients. Something that they probably hear me say all the time is that our map of the world is not the same thing as the territory. Um, and that's something that I know that we walked through. Um, and we spent a lot of time on ourselves by exposing our clients to different deals and different opportunities and different situations to help really get a better map of what the actual territory is of this world of business acquisition.

Which is also something that we—it's important for us to do—to be able to dive in head first to shaking hands and rubbing elbows with brokers who are on the other side of a lot of these transactions and help to get a better idea of, okay, what does this world actually look like and how can we use that to help serve our clients, uh, with their dreams of buying the perfect business, moving into a phenomenal acquisition.

It was an amazing time. We, uh, I suppose starting off with what the current state looks like. One thing that we kept hearing over and over—and something that some of you who are live in deals right now see—is that it is a competitive market out there. Talking to a lot of brokers, it seems like there's an average of six LOIs, um, you know, going out into deals that are on the table right now.

Which is why it's also really important for us to be able to keep creating great relationships and keep creating great plugs for us to be able to help get the best deals in front of our clients sooner, earlier, to help them act a lot quicker.

[00:06:00]
Cash: You know, there were a couple things that really stood out. I think, uh, probably one of the major things from the conference that was also the kickoff—and this might be kind of cheesy, cliche, but also really real—one of the lenders from Live Oak Bank kicked off the conference by saying, look, just like it takes a village to raise a child, it does take a village to get a deal together and to get a deal across the line. And that is something that is really true and it's something to really keep in mind.

Some of you are beginning your process of buying a business. Some of you are in the middle and you've been through the trenches. Uh, one thing that stood in my mind, it became a lot more true, is that even though these are transactions, and even though this is a transaction of buying a business, it isn't transactional. It isn't a transactional process.

It takes a lot of very real human relationships and a lot of sources to be able to plug in and make a deal a reality, whether it is the brokers being able to provide the quality deal, whether it's a relationship with the right banker, whether it's the relationship with the right tax, legal advisor—it takes a community of individuals on both sides.

And being able to make sure that we're mindful of those relationships as we're going into the deal process is something that becomes extremely critical. And I think it's something that we can take a step back and keep in mind a lot more of whenever we're going through this process, making sure that we are putting relationships first.

[00:08:00]
Cash: And I think that that really ties into something to keep in mind from the broker space. One thing that probably isn't a mystery is that it isn't just the silver tsunami of business sellers out there right now. There's also a silver tsunami of brokers as well. And one thing that really—we spend all day on phone calls with brokers, and sometimes these cannot be the best conversations that we have. Sometimes it can feel a little bit real and raw, but really being able to get out there and shake hands and see things from their world really put into perspective that it probably is best to—if we're having some kind of relationship that isn't feeling as good, or it doesn't feel like the broker is picking up their end of the ball, or something's lost in translation—after really shaking hands and getting to know these people a lot more in depth over three days, I think a framework for myself and that can also be useful for our clients is that I think it's a lot more healthy to assume that there was a slip-up before we assume negligence or malevolence, or assuming that there was some sort of wrongdoing.

A lot of these brokers are very underwater with their own workflow. A lot of them are really old school, carrying around their physical notebooks and their physical appointment books. But that is just the reality of the broker world right now. And a lot of them actually have some amazing, good intentions behind them, even if they are a little bit slower to the game on getting back to us or picking up their end of responsibilities.

[00:10:00]
Cash: There are a couple just cool quotes and stories that I think a lot of you will relate to—either those who are in the middle of their search or those who are beginning it. Talking to one broker, it really clicked into my head a situation that I've been seeing. And I know that some of my clients—I know Steve Polly went through a similar situation. I was asking brokers, what's one big war story or frustration that came to mind? And one of them really stood out, something that we don't really think about. One broker really said, look, people who are selling their business in their sixties, seventies, I love that. I've run into problems with people who are selling their business in their forties because those people typically want their price and their terms, and sometimes they end up wanting a higher price than what we agreed to whenever we got started.

And seeing the broker was frustrated about that—you know, I know we've personally been frustrated by the same situation—so it's something that we can kind of keep in mind as we're going into a deal and also be able to think about the broker's set of shoes from that front. That was actually the broker that we've worked on with some construction deals out in Dallas himself.

You know, also just kind of being able to see there were some brokers there who had worked with our clients as well. So there was a Sunbelt broker, Houston, who actually worked with Justin on a coworking space deal. And we were actually at the first happy hour there, and I was explaining to the broker what we did, and then Justin came up and he was like, oh, Justin, yeah, I know you—like, y'all are awesome.

And in that instance, the broker was awesome. Justin was awesome—the broker loved Justin. But in this deal with this coworking space, it was the seller themselves that just had some unrealistic expectations. And even though the broker loved Justin and the broker was trying to sell what would be reasonable to Justin, it ended up being that the seller themselves was the bottleneck. And that really ties back to the idea that it takes a community in order to make a deal happen. Sometimes it's not just the broker; sometimes it's the seller themselves, and maybe they need to go through an education process before they're able to actually put their deal and their listing on the transaction.

[00:12:30]
Cash: A couple of really awesome times—like I was in line for food to go get lunch, and I just start talking with this woman who's a broker in Dallas, Rochelle. And we start talking about what we do and talking about how we actually work to help educate our buyers and make sure that, you know, we're really touching base on what reality is on transactions. And she just shouts out in the middle of scooping food onto her plate, she goes, good. I hate Cody Sanchez. I'm so mad, I'm so tired of dealing with buyers who wanna come in and do a hundred percent seller financing. I really hate Cody Sanchez. And she's scooping up food onto her plate. And she was like, yeah, like this idea of sellers love a hundred percent financing, they think it's awesome—like, no, no, they don't. They hate it. I'm tired of it. She was like, I'm glad you guys are here to work with your buyers and actually like doing deal structuring. That's awesome.

So yeah, another huge funny story. Another one—just to like kind of go back to how it can be a bit of a competitive market—you know, right now there were a couple individual buyers who were at the conference themselves talking to brokers. These were individual buyers themselves. I talked to a guy named Chebe, who actually flew in from California. He was a bit more on the PE side—he had a PE background—but was looking to buy his business for himself. And he was a solo gunner, though. He was a solo gunner, and he'd been at it for 18 months. He'd been doing this for 18 months, trying to find the right opportunity.

And, you know, for him though, it was just him on the ground. And it really showed a lot of the value of kind of what we are doing and how quick we're able to move with a team behind us and a team of resources able to plug our buyers into the right opportunities. He was pretty disenchanted and was getting lost looking at the trees versus the forest. So it really just kind of reaffirmed a lot of the movement that we were seeing with our clients versus, you know, him only looking at a deal a month trying to make things happen.

Athena: I think I know which one you're talking about. So yeah, why don't you do that and then wrap it off and hand it off.

Cash: Alright, cool.

[00:18:30]
Charis: Thanks, Cash. I'm not gonna have quite as, uh, exciting stories like that. I think that takes the cake for sure. Um, yeah, broker relationships—I mean, wow. Super important topic for us to cover today, easily one of the most pivotal relationships in the business acquisition sphere. I'm excited to be here today and share alongside my colleagues our experience, our take, and our tips in what brokers look for in buyers, and just as importantly, the red flags that cause brokers and sellers to hesitate about you and potentially walk away entirely.

I have a little bit of a unique background. My career actually started in the sell side as an M&A advisor. So what I'm sharing with you all today not only comes from my experience and intel from the broker conference, but also in large part, I learned personal experience in the field of brokering as I was in their shoes myself.

So I'm on that other end of the phone vetting buyers and talking to people like yourself. And so at the end of the day, essentially a broker is a gatekeeper. And I think it's important to understand why. Like, why don't they want to talk to all the buyers in the world? Why not bring the masses in front of the opportunity? And the simple answer is there are large stakes at play. The business owner has essentially retained their services expecting that they only let real closers be introduced to them. Business owners don't want to talk to a hundred people about their business. They are primed and ready to talk to about 20-plus well-suited, serious buyers.

The owners only have so much bandwidth in their day. They're literally running a full-time business. So my job as a broker was to vet all our interested buyers. As a broker, I'm looking for why you are the right buyer or why you aren't the right buyer. And to give you some perspective on the large stakes at play—if a broker introduces an unfit buyer to the seller, that could end in a disaster. It could cause a bad experience for that owner, and it can even turn into a fatal business decision by breaking trust between that broker and that owner. So a bad seller experience can and will—I've seen it firsthand—cause a seller to break up with that broker or walk away from selling as a whole.

For context, if we're talking about a $10 million business, that's easily a $500,000 fee for that brokerage, which they don't make unless they sell. So you have to think, why am I worth risking that broker's salary, that broker's job, and that broker's reputation? This is why in large they're gonna be extremely cautious and treat this like they're essentially interviewing you to be CEO of that business, right?

So they will take you seriously if they find that you're a qualified, prepared candidate, one that can bring confidence on both sides of the deal and not cause a potential revenue and earnings fatality for their brokerage firm. It's the broker's reputation at stake, their income at stake, to allow you through the deal process. So first and foremost, important to grasp why and understand the complexities in the deal behind the scenes between the broker and the owner.

[00:23:00]
Charis: So if we start with the end in mind—how do we successfully manage that relationship and the image that the broker will have on you and on us representing you? What are some ways that we can gain from the broker's confidence and their trust that you are a real closer, not a serial shopper, a serial searcher, but a strong fit buyer? What makes you stand out in the pool of buyers that will show the sell side that you can and are likely to close on the very deal that we're learning about and interested in?

All that to say, the landscape is shaped by both opportunity and caution. It's—you know, we're talking about a market flush with capital, competition's high, and we're learning and seeing that brokers are receiving hundreds of NDAs upon submission and launching on the marketplace. So at this rate, brokers are more cautious, and with their job to gatekeep it has become even more essential to keep that trust with the business owner.

I'm gonna go through some of what I think are some really strong points that can help us collectively towards being that choice buyer and being a fit buyer, and then alongside what are some common red flags and some points on how you can be a front runner in the space.

Brokers are pretty simple. There's gonna be two buckets. You're either gonna be a yes to them or a no to them pretty early on. So that first impression is super important. And just getting to know them on a personal level, making it, like we said, a relationship before it's a transaction—because you wanna stand out on that impression level.

A couple points on being a fit buyer:
- Be clear on your financial strategy. A flawed buyer will be unclear on your financial path.
- A fit buyer's gonna have context on why they're personally tied to the deal they're looking at. A flawed buyer is a mystery—doesn't know why they're looking at this deal, what ties you into the deal, what's gonna keep you to close to this opportunity.
- Being a fit buyer, you are showing clear motivation; a flawed buyer will show unprofessionalism, have poor communication, reactive decision making.
- Lastly, a fit buyer will show that you have a strong, competent deal team, versus a flawed buyer who is kind of à la carte—family friend—like you're just pulling your personal contacts, hoping that it'll pan out for a successful deal team.

I think brokers are really gonna heavily look at these four points.

[00:26:00]
Charis: Diving in a little bit deeper on your financial strategy: you're gonna wanna be really clear and familiar with your buying power. Be prepared to speak confidently about your financing strategy. Know your liquidity, your pre-qualification, proof of funds, and what you intend in your mix—like your financing stack, your cash, your SBA, seller note. They may ask for that really early on, and so you wanna be confident and know already your financing strategy going into the deal.

On the context part—industry experience—I can't say how much that improves the first impression whenever I had a buyer inquiring on the deal. I would say it strongly partners next to the financing aspect, and also it's partnered with your financing involving SBA programs. They wanna know that you know who you are, how you're tied to the deal, what's your experience in the industry and in the operations. Having a lack of that can be seen as risky and less credible.

Alternatively, though, we gotta get a little creative here 'cause we won't always have that industry experience. So understanding and really thinking through transferable business ownership, management skills—transferable skills from your past experience where you've led and had successful stewardship—those would be important to call out and relate to the deal. 'Cause business is fractal, right? Underneath what it shows and appears to be, a lot of business has very similar operations. So call into those and tie into those personal experiences that you have and personal expertise that you do have.

And then if you're really not familiar with the industry but really are interested in the deal, you know, demonstrating your commitment to upskilling in those spaces—joining industry groups, seeking mentors and expertise to surround yourself with—those actions will help show your seriousness to the broker if, again, you don't have a strong tie to the deal.

Having clear strategic motivation: Is this an entry point for you? Is this a personal goal? Are you planning to run the business kind of as is, or do you have a vision to scale it and do expansion? Having a well-mapped strategy will signal a lot of thought investment on your part and will score early favor and trust with the broker as well. You want to personalize this deal as much as possible where the opportunity that you're looking at sounds like the one and only opportunity you're looking at, because brokers will know if you are kind of out and about and just shopping around and not showing material thought going into it.

Communication and responsiveness is a big part of that—again, it's similar to an interview process. You want to show that you're professional, you're prompt, and that you're clear on communication. You don't want to be missing appointments, slow to responsiveness, and providing incomplete materials.

And then lastly, having a competent advisory team. This, I would say, is a non-negotiable in today's landscape. You want to surround yourself with transaction-experienced attorneys, accountants, M&A advisors—key to helping you vet, structure, and close efficiently. Brokers are gonna be quick to flag solo, DIY, super green buyers—that's a big risk for them to put in front of the owner, so it can lead to missteps, loss of trust, and broken deals. You don't want to surround yourself and pull your personal contacts together, like relying on generalists or friends and family. You want a specialized M&A team around you to score those confidence points with the broker. So go ahead and drop names—be specific: you're working with M&A experts at AcquiMatch, at Live Oak Bank, Barlow & Williams. Remove yourself from the potential mystery bubble because they don't know what all you're working with in the background. I encourage—the more you can share, the more you can gain trust and confidence with that broker, because they want to be able to be confident about moving you forward.

[00:31:00]
Charis: Those would be really my high points to really pay attention to. Last thing I would just say is, you know, be collaborative with your broker. They are, at the end of the day—if you are a solid buyer—they will be on your side. They are your intel. They are your leverage to create favorability and insight to the deal that only they will know. So feel free to ask them after you, of course, cross that bridge on relationship—getting to know them just as a person—but also, you know, hey James, what do you think about this structure when you're putting an offer together? Or do you think the seller would be open to, you know, seller financing and so on? You can pass them information before you put a structured deal out to kind of leverage your intel on the deal. And more times than not, I think the brokers are kind of happy to guide you, because they want a successful closing on the deal. So remember at the end of the day, the broker's there to gatekeep their potentially $500,000 in fees. So that's the level we need to work at: we need to be impressive and we need to be transparent so that we gain confidence and trust with the brokers.

So that is pretty much my thoughts and collective experience in the broker world. I hope that's helpful. And I'll go ahead and pass it off to Luke now.

[00:33:00]
Luke: Thanks, Charis. I really like a lot of those analogies you just brought up. We got Cash with the really entertaining stories and Charis with the experience in sell-side brokerage and how to be a good buyer versus bad buyer.

So we did learn a lot going to this conference—networking, talking to a lot of different brokers, hearing many different lectures and presentations on the industry and different aspects of it. First of all, I would start off by strongly seconding everything that Cash and Charis just said. They hit on really all of the main points that we learned and kind of the state of the industry—this searcher market trying to buy small businesses.

I would hammer in again, although I know we already know it, how these brokers are operating in the world that they're in right now. With Cody Sanchez—who apparently that lady in the lunch line really hates—and a lot of other brokers do as well. There are so many non-serious internet tire kickers coming in that aren't financially qualified, trying to buy businesses with 90% seller financing and things like that. There's so many tire kickers. One quote that I heard from multiple different brokers and lenders, probably over five times, is when I asked them what kind of they're seeing in the market, what struggles they're having with buyers—'cause like Athena said, we were there as a research project trying to understand the industry more—I got told multiple times in a very energetic tone, there's no—they got no effing money about the buyers. They just got no f-ing money. Sometimes it was at the happy hour when these guys had a couple of beers in them, so they were really letting loose about these poor, unqualified buyers.

[00:34:00]
Luke: You have to understand kind of the state of the market, because oftentimes I've noticed this with some of our clients: they get frustrated with the way these brokers work, but they don't necessarily understand the full picture. And obviously we always do our best to fully explain it, but I just wanna kind of give some details here.

One broker that I was talking about, for example, he told me a story, and this is why these brokers are so hard at screening buyers and making sure they put the right people in front of their seller—like Charis told you. Right? This one buyer, he came in—great guy, real smooth talker, was financially qualified—basically smooth-talked the broker into snaking himself into a seller call where before he was telling the broker, oh yeah, 4x multiple, SBA financing, 10% down payment, I really like this business. And so the broker, as the gatekeeper, opened up the gate and put him in front of the seller, and then that buyer offers that seller 90% seller financing. And the broker's sitting there on the Zoom call with his head in his hands, shaking his head because it's embarrassing to the broker. Right? So there's a lot of mistrust because there's a lot of bad actors in the space right now.

Again, something that our clients often get frustrated with is how unorganized and sometimes unprofessional these brokers are, and I totally understand. I agree as well. I remember Cash and I—and I think all of us—had a conversation with this one lady, and this story really kind of shows the state of the market and the reason they seem so unorganized is—and unprofessional—'cause there are so many buyers, their email inboxes are getting flooded with hundreds of inquiries, so they don't have the time, nor do they need to take the care to be that organized and talk to every buyer. Because even if he doesn't respond to this buyer and this buyer and this buyer, there's 30 other buyers over here that will submit offers on that business. Right? Because it's a seller's market.

This one lady—again, speaking of the older generation and brokers being flooded with buyers—she told us, yeah, I was just getting too many emails, so I just deleted my email. Like, this is the type of brokers that we're dealing with. She literally just deleted her email. And I know it's very frustrating, but you just have to understand the sheer numbers they're working with. I often get told in the first day, sometimes in the first few hours, there's two or even 300 inquiries on a deal, depending on the deal.

[00:36:00]
Luke: So what some of you may be thinking right now is, oh, I get it. There's a ton of tire kickers from the internet out there. There's 200 bad buyers, but I'm one of the good ones. You're right. You are one of the good ones, and AcquiMatch has helped you become one of the best buyers. But you have to understand, out of those 200 inquiries, let's say 180 of them were tire kickers, but 20 of those buyers are rock solid, financially qualified, and have matching experience to that deal. They're great buyers. And out of those 20—again, depending on the deal—five to 10 of them will submit LOIs sometimes within two to three weeks.

Again, all depending on the deal. Some of these very competitive deals, there's private equity groups, strategic acquirers in the mix, and some of these groups—the PE firms and the strategic acquirers—they don't even meet the sellers sometimes. They just submit an LOI after one broker call, sometimes I've heard of LOIs being submitted without even meeting with the broker, just reading over the CIM and submitting an LOI. That's just the nature of the market.

And so this is kind of just some insights to understanding of why the brokers are how they are. I really like Cash's analogy—yes, we hear about the silver tsunami of sellers and matching that there's the silver tsunami of brokers. And having worked here with these brokers for almost a year now—what an old generation these brokers come from and how they operate. They're so unorganized and really bad with scheduling and technology. I've found peace in the fact that I realized that they're just matching their clientele. Right? The service provider, the broker, is just matching the clientele because if the seller is, you know, kind of an old, stubborn, stuck-in-their-way boomer, he's gonna interact and get in touch with an old, stuck-in-their-way, disorganized boomer broker. Right?

Because think about it—if I was a broker and I was out here advertising on TikTok, trying to get sellers to come to me to list their businesses, the boomer who maybe doesn't even have a smartphone—not to discredit his intelligence or success, he's probably running a business that's cash flowing a million dollars a year—but that boomer's never gonna see me on TikTok. He's gonna find the other boomer that's at the country club, that's advertising in the newspaper, that's doing just direct phone calls, that doesn't take scheduled calls, because that's where a lot of these sellers are. And so the brokers just reflect the same clientele, the same type of group as the sellers.

[00:38:00]
Luke: For example, there was this talk at the conference. It was pitched towards brokers—like how to improve your brokerage and get more leads. And they were suggesting all of these different marketing channels, and there were all of these crazy, outdated marketing channels that I don't even think about anymore—things like newspapers. I may have even seen like faxing machines in there somewhere. We do regularly get asked by brokers to fax NDAs over sometimes though, so this is just the nature of the market—what a generational divide there is with these brokers. We have to understand the brokers are just matching the sellers because the brokers and the sellers are the same people right now.

There's a lot of bad news of the market and how competitive it is, and I'm telling you how disorganized and sometimes frustrating it is to work with these brokers. The good news is you have advisors like us that help you through this process, and the brokers like what we do. 99% of the brokers love us and what we do. They are definitely skeptical at first, and they definitely need some talking to—we need to clear out some red flags in the beginning—but once they understand what we're doing, and like Cash said, some of the brokers there that have worked with our clients, they really like working with us and they look forward to it in the future.

So that's the good news. A lot of the brokers do enjoy working with us and what we're doing here in the market because, one, you guys hiring us, having advisors—it shows you have skin in the game. You're serious; you're not a tire kicker; you're not that person from the internet. Also as advisors, we're helping set you up on the right foot. This is part of the pitch that I sell to brokers when I'm introducing you to a broker. I tell them, oh yeah, we have this buyer, they're great—financially pre-qualified. We refer them out also to M&A lawyers, QoE accountants. Right? So they have serious firepower behind them to close on a deal. They're not showing up to you trying to close a deal with their family lawyer or tax accountant. The brokers always get a kick out of that. They say, oh yeah, that's great, that's great. So you have the right advisors in your corner, as Charis said.

[00:41:00]
Luke: And something that's kind of a pivot that we wanted to bring up is these buyer profiles. I think Charis and Cash had touched on this as well—how important these buyer profiles are to the brokers. Even though we make that great buyer profile, the website for you—you know, these brokers, they're very stuck in their ways and, as we've discussed, they hold the cards, right? They have the deal. And so we need to get through the gatekeeper. And some of these brokers really care a lot about their buyer profile and they want you to fill out their buyer profile.

Sometimes in the past we've sort of had you guys fill out the buyer profile in more of a concise way and not as much information normally because we've already established a relationship with the broker. We found out—some of this we knew before, 'cause we fill out all the buyer profiles in a very detailed manner when we're embarking on a deal—but there was a broker panel where brokers were talking and one broker was saying, if you don't fill out a buyer profile, I don't even look at you. There was another broker who was saying he basically selects buyers for deals based on his buyer profiles. So when he gets a deal to list, he doesn't even market it out immediately. He takes a look at all his buyer profiles and pitches the right buyer. So who knows—with that broker, which I'm sure a lot of other brokers work in that same way—if you had a very detailed and filled out buyer profile there, he would've found you in the file and may have reached out to you.

Now, we help you with this by making all of the information for a buyer profile very easily accessible. We already have that buyer profile link, the website, filled out, and we also have the personal financial statement pinned to your Slack messages. So that can help you fill out buyer profiles easier and quicker.

And then again, just to strongly second what Charis was saying about selling your experience as much as you can. The number two complaint that I got from all of these brokers—and lenders as well—after they, you know, cussed out these buyers for having no money, was not having matching experience. And yeah, they just kept complaining about that. And that's okay if you don't have perfect matching experience, right? Because some of you might be inquiring on a roofing company, but you don't have roofing experience, and that's totally okay. A lot of our clients are inquiring on businesses where they don't have direct experience, but like Charis said, you're very successful and have a lot of transferable skills that you can sell, you can pitch, for that business.

For example, no, maybe I haven't run my own business before, but I've run my own team with this many people under me in my company. So it wasn't entrepreneurial, but it was intrapreneurial. And you can talk about your leadership and management experience. Or just, you know, for example, you're looking at a machine shop and the broker or the lender's trying to tell you, you don't have any machining experience. Well, yeah, that's true, Mr. Broker, Mr. Lender, but I have a whole career in client-facing sales, and the main role of what this current seller is doing—he's working 40 hours a week doing sales. Right? So you just wanna flex those transferable skills. And I really like Charis's analogy—I hadn't thought about this—but saying that it's like an interview when you meet this broker. Right? And what do you do in an interview? You're trying to pitch yourself that you're the best fit for that job. And so you wanna do the same when you're operating as a buyer inquiring on a company.

[00:43:30]
Luke: There was a story that this SBA lender told about Steve Mariani where he was lecturing at the conference, and he was saying it was a large HVAC company, about 25 employees. And the lender was pushing back on him and the buyer, saying, oh, but you don't have HVAC experience, you don't have HVAC experience. And he tells the lender, well, yeah, he doesn't have HVAC experience, but this business has 25 employees. They have 15 technicians or 20 technicians. The current owner hasn't touched an HVAC system in 10 years. What this company needs is management experience and leadership experience. So these are ways you can pitch and sell yourself and really ace that interview.

Another thing that we learned from the lenders—which, again, we already knew and we've told you this before—but they had a lender panel where multiple different lenders were talking about the state of the market, their deals and everything, and as expected, these lenders are also saying cash flow and add-backs are always the biggest problem. Right? As all of you know when looking at these deals, all of the add-backs and the cash flow that the broker lists on the CIM—or sometimes that they claim it is—aren't always accurate and true. So this is why we always hammer in that the add-backs are so important. We always ask about them on the calls if there's any suspicious add-backs. And then sometimes if when we spoke to the broker and we weren't able to get the exact details on the add-back, we highly encourage you, when you meet with the seller, to be able to learn more about those add-backs, 'cause there's almost always a change to the add-backs.

[00:45:30]
Luke: And lastly, I kind of wanted to end off just on a bit of an inspirational quote—something that this one broker had discussed in the broker panel. He dropped this one quote that really kind of hit home for me—something that, not only in work, is how we operate our searches here at AcquiMatch and how we operate our company, and also I like to be like this just in my personal life. And now I'm trying to pivot and market this to you as buyers, as searchers looking at these deals: be a hunter, not a farmer.

What I mean by that is sometimes, yes, you hired us and we do all the work of getting the deal, reading the CIM, doing the write-up, introducing you to the broker—but something that you'll find a lot given the nature of the industry, these brokers—how we told you how non-responsive and how unorganized they are—sometimes they're very bad at responding even after we've already built the relationship with them, because again, they have hundreds of other people spamming their email inbox.

So I've seen some clients get frustrated by that in the past. And again, we don't want you to be frustrated. I want you to be like me. I understand—I've been doing this for longer than you guys, almost a year now. I was so frustrated at first, but now I found peace. I'm at a peaceful level. I found Zen because I know how these brokers are. I know it's on me. I have to be a hunter, not a farmer.

So don't get frustrated. Just understand the situation that that broker's in and how many other buyers are in the mix. Right? And sometimes you do have to hunt the broker. For example, when we make that introduction—we introduce you to the broker over email—again, these brokers have hundreds of emails. Or there's that one broker: I was getting too many emails, so I just deleted it. I'm sure there's a ton of brokers that are getting too many emails, so they just stopped checking their emails. So sometimes you can't just email the broker and wait for that broker to get back to you. You can't just sit there and farm and wait for the deal to harvest. You need to go out there and get your bow and arrow and hunt that deal.

[00:48:00]
Luke: So don't be afraid of a good cold call sometimes. If it's a competitive deal, a high-quality deal, and it's a fit for you—you’re really excited about this deal—don't farm, don't wait for the broker. Take off the overalls and put on your camo and hunt that broker. If he's not responding to your email in 24 or 48 hours, give him a cold call. Normally the phone numbers are in their email signature, or you can ask us to get you their phone numbers and you can give them a cold call. Like I said, this boomer generation, that's how they operate. They don't schedule calls. They just say, oh, yeah, yeah, call me at three tomorrow. And in the car, they have their phone next to 'em. And if you just call 'em, you can catch them. I've seen a lot of our clients who are willing to go hunting get a lot of success getting these brokers on the phone. So I would just strongly encourage you not to get frustrated at that and go hunt the deals.

I would recommend the triple attack. That's when you email the broker and they don't respond to your email—it's been two days almost—and you want this deal, you wanna meet the seller. Okay—get the phone number from the email signature, or ask your analyst. The Slack channel will have their office number as well as their mobile number sometimes. And so what I say, when they don't respond to your email: call them. If they don't pick up your call, leave a voicemail, and then also text them. That's the triple attack.

I also like—I prefer more—the quintuple approach. Again, I've been doing this for a year, but I prefer the quintuple approach, which is email, then call, then voicemail, then text, and then I even get on LinkedIn, connect with them and message them. And then when we're really getting crazy with it, sometimes we do the sextuple approach, which is all five of those, and we call one of their coworkers at their office. For example, if I'm trying to talk to Cash, but Cash isn't picking up, but I know I've worked with Charis on a deal before, I'm gonna call Charis and say, hey Charis, is Cash in the office? I'm trying to talk to him. We were gonna talk about a deal. So we really get creative and aggressive about it sometimes—without being spammy and annoying the brokers, of course. But again, I really like this theme of being a hunter, not a farmer. Normally the brokers will be responsive, but sometimes, even after all of the preloaded frontal work that we set you guys up on the right foot with, you still have to hunt the broker. Right? Because he or she, that broker, is dealing with hundreds of different buyers. So I'll end it on that—just my inspirational quote of the day: be a hunter, not a farmer. Thanks.

[00:51:00]
Athena: Amazing. Thanks, team. That was so awesome. And it was really amazing having all of 'em on the ground and gathering all that intel. There's a whole bunch of stuff we're actually gonna be implementing, both internally but also rolling out to you all to make it even better and easier as you engage with on-market deals.

Just to kind of encapsulate what everybody was saying—relationships go so far, right? So if the broker remembers you and they think that you're a qualified buyer and they're excited about you, and they like you, then they're more likely to want to push you forward, and they end up becoming your advocate once they get behind you and once they see you as, you know, the ideal buyer for the business.

We heard a whole bunch of horror stories about brokers selling a business and then something happened after the fact. And the brokers don't like that happening either. You know, we heard a story of a broker that sold to a buyer and immediately the business was like, shut down. All the employees fired. None of the customer service. That was a non-compete in place. And they were mortified about it. And their seller was like, really upset and like, can we please do something, our clients need help, et cetera, et cetera. So I think the brokers like a real person that has heart and is gonna take over the business as much as the owners do. But when their paycheck's on the line and when they've had all these bad actors and people that have done things, you know, it's understandable that they're so wary, especially with, you know, the Codys and the Bens and whoever out there just making this seem like it's a lot easier than it is.

[00:53:00]
Athena: So when we encourage you to take these broker calls, it is also to get that, you know, confidence up when you're talking to them and learn how to talk to them and learn how to pitch yourself. I was talking to Lisa, I think, about this on Tuesday. When you get on the call, just connecting to the why—like, why are you looking at this deal? Why are you interested in this deal? Even if you're on the fence about it, that's okay. We're not trying to force you to look at something that wouldn't be a fit, but we see something in it that we connect you to it. And I can't tell you how many times a client has been like, uh, I'm not really sure about that deal. And then they get on the phone with the broker, they get on the phone with the owner and they're like, oh my God, you know—and they get excited and they start putting an offer in. So we see a connection between you and that deal.

And then if you can connect to why you're looking at that business with the broker, it goes so far. So connecting to, okay, I see that the current owner does sales—I have a sales background and that's why I'm really excited about it. Or, I'm excited about this industry for this reason. If they understand that you're not just looking at it and like window shopping and have absolutely no reason for looking at it. So even if it's not industry experience, it's a reason.

[00:55:00]
Athena: Another—there's some other cool stuff that we heard in terms of structuring and creative things that can be done. We found some lenders that are comfortable with very high customer concentration, which is awesome. But one thing I'll talk about with the SBA structuring that I'm very excited about—'cause y'all know that's what I nerd out about the most, having lost my perfect deal because I didn't know how to structure it properly at the time.

When the seller note's in the like 100 to 200 K range—and the reason behind that seller note—so when you're putting a seller note in, and if it's just for skin in the game, then looking at the amount of the seller note and thinking, well, is there another way to accomplish this that gets the same result? So one of the things that was thrown out there was: rather than doing a 100 to 200 K seller note, put them on a salary. Pay them a high monthly amount for that year. And if they don't show up, you don't pay 'em. They don't get that money. But it lowers your overall project costs, which means it lowers your overall equity injection. It gets the skin in the game in that sense because you're just trying to get them bought into the transition support. And rather than doing it as a seller note, doing it as a salary. And I thought that was a really creative way to essentially—you know, they get the same amount of money, you get—they only get paid if they show up and they're delivering, because they can have an employment contract or work with the business for 12 months with SBA.

There's a lot of little nuggets like that that we're also gonna be incorporating. But that was the one that jumped out at me as like a tool in the toolkit with SBA financing. So wanted to share that one as you guys are playing around with the structuring. There are some other things that were pretty interesting that came up in terms of structuring and stuff like that, so we'll be sharing those.

[00:56:00]
Athena: Another thing that brokers talked about is, when you're sending the LOI, to also make a personal connection when you're sending it. So they suggested a letter, but something that we've done in the past—and Steve will remember this because they did it—but we like doing things a little bit differently: sending a video cover letter—why you're interested in the business, why you're excited about it, what your vision is. It goes a really long way, 'cause they can pass that along to the seller. So that's a fun one too. It's really about that personal connection and the relationships.

And we are really having some fun with some ideas here for how we can get even more relational behind the scenes. But, imagine this is somebody that you're like, oh my—this is somebody I wanna get their attention. They're in high demand. How can I just be delightful so they wanna deal with me and they wanna talk to me? That 24-hour response time—I can't tell you how far that goes. The quick yes or no—I can't tell you how far that goes. If you're not interested in a deal and you moved on—not ghosting 'em—being like, hey, I'm not the right buyer for this. Thank you so much for your time. Loved talking to you. Hope something else comes up. Please talk to the team if you have anything else that might be of... Those letting people know where they stand and closing it out goes so far and also helps us too.

[00:58:00]
Athena: If you're not doing your part in the relationship, that broker's not really super excited about talking to us in the future about deals on your behalf. So just know that too. It's not just that deal—it's future deals with that person. And if they were like, ah, they weren't taking it seriously, or they were a tire kicker, or they didn't respond to me, or they just ghosted me after I introduced to the seller, it makes the team's life a lot harder to try to get that relationship back.

I think that was all the main stuff, but wasn't that cool hearing from the team and their different takeaways? And there's far more war stories and just like, oh my goodness moments. And I think the thing that gets me excited as someone that's new in this industry compared to these folks that have been there for 30, 40 years is how we can help also that transition of businesses changing hands. There's so much experience with these folks that have been doing it for 20, 30, 40 years. They've seen so many transactions. And there's not young people entering into business brokering. So they get really excited when they see people like us and our team out there. You put up your hand and you're like, I'm interested in business brokering, and you have like 10 of them running over and they're like, I wanna hand over to somebody. Where do you find good brokers? And then they have this issue where it's like, new broker coming in and can't get paid for 12 to 18 months on a deal. So there's also this kind of crisis of transfer of business brokering to the next generation too.

Oh, cool. Steve, I'm glad you enjoyed that. Y'all have any questions or thoughts that came up? We've been talking at you, but curious to hear thoughts, questions, observations?

[01:00:00]
Steve: No, I love it. So I love hearing reality. Whether I agree with the reality or not is irrelevant. I love the person, Cash, that you ran into who said Cody Sanchez is like the evil empire right now, but yet, you know, the reason why that inbox is full right now and it's a seller's market is because of that—Ben Kelly and Cody Sanchez not shutting up about it and getting everybody excited. So I get the frustration—they gotta weed through a lot of garbage—but just understanding how they're thinking is super valuable in the approach, you know, 'cause we're not here to make friends. We're here to buy a business. So—

[01:01:30]
Athena: But if you make friends, you're more likely to buy a business, you know? And, like, making friends—these guys get berated with like crazy stuff all the time. And the only reason I was still in my deal as long as I was is because I was like the late night therapist for the broker. And he would just unload on me for like an hour about all the crap he was going through. He liked me, you know, and I'm like—I don't have an edge here because I know there's strategics, there's private equity, there's all these experienced buyers in the mix. So I'm gonna do whatever I can to get this guy to give me a chance.

[01:02:00]
Steve: You know, I got—80% of the people out there that are buying businesses are first-time business buyers. They're not private equity. I mean, at a certain level it is, but, you know, I'm sure they're dealing with a lot of people and, yeah, at least we have you guys to help us through it. They're probably dealing with a lot of people that are just out of their minds what they're thinking. And so I could see the frustration. And again, it's really, for me, the insights are, okay, yeah, maybe I don't agree, but it doesn't matter. So maybe I need to make some adjustments myself in speaking and try to understand what they're thinking.

[01:02:30]
Athena: I talk about that a lot—meet 'em where they're at. Something that is a really awesome tool that I've used for years when I learned it is when you talk to 'em: hey, what's your preferred mode of communication? You want me to text, email, call? They love that so much—just meeting 'em where they're at with their communication style. These little things can just make you feel like the right buyer to them just because you're making their life that much easier. They like text messages? Okay, I'm gonna text 'em. Or like with Luke, that sextuple attack—making yourself... But it shows that you're keen, right? It shows that you're interested in the deal.

And that's something that happens so much to them right now with this influx of people. There's a whole bunch of people that love the idea of buying a business without having the wherewithal to make it a reality. And I heard from the founder of Baton, which is an online brokerage platform—he, I don't know where the stat came from, but I've run it by a lot of people and they're like, feels about right—that only 2% of people that say they want to buy a business actually follow through and do it. And when you look at the industry reports from the M&A industry, the amount of people that actually close on a transaction as an individual are much smaller than existing business owners, private equity, strategics. As a percentage of buyers that close, first-timers, individuals, are much smaller. And I don't think it's just because they're being gate kept—it's a very involved, crazy process. And you guys have us with you, but a lot of people trying to do this on their own—making multimillion dollar business decisions without an experienced team when you don't have experience—is a hard thing to do.

There are people that have been searching for years and a lot of people like the idea of what Cody and Ben are saying, you know, but don't understand the reality behind it. I am just watching—'cause I've been in this space for so long—I'm watching a whole bunch of people not be able to continue with the businesses that they bought. Also, you know, they didn't ask enough questions, they didn't have the right team and support, they didn't get themselves into the right business, and they're shutting it down. So that was a rant. Sorry, Steven, you caught me.

[01:05:00]
Steve: And it actually is a question that I had for you—yeah, the team actually. Did you get any sense of—and you know, I know there's some funny stories here—but did you get any sense on the broker side that they realize what it's like to be on the buyer side? You're personally guaranteeing in a lot of cases your life savings to make sure this thing works and, you know, how many of the deals that close end up failing, and then you're seeing numbers and getting through a lot of these. Sometimes it's not what they appear in the CIM when you start peeling the layers of the onion back. So while we may seem difficult to them, at the same point, you know, is there—and I'm not saying that they're right or wrong—but was there any kind of feeling that, yeah, we kind of get what your buyers are going through too, or no, just they're a pain in my butt?

[01:06:00]
Athena: I'm gonna look at Cash, Charis, or Luke. They were doing a lot of the broker convos. Did you get any sense of that from them?

Luke: Yeah, I think, Steve, that's a great question. And I think unfortunately there's not as much sympathy there from the brokers, and I think that's part of maybe the misaligned incentives here in this industry that AcquiMatch, as a disruptive startup, is trying to change about this industry.

Something I'm thinking about is—well, one, obviously, you know, the brokers, they get paid at close; they're done after that. The seller stops being their client after that. So do a lot of them really care what happens to the business after they get paid their fee? If the deal closes and they make their money, they're out, they made their money—they're gonna go buy cars for the racetrack in Vegas like that one broker.

And I also think about it, Steve, as—I've heard the saying that in big cities, people are a lot ruder and don't care about other people as much because there are so many—just sardines packed in one can. And then in a small rural town, everybody's a lot nicer and cares about each other because there are so few people and you know everyone. I would use that same analogy to this seller's market right now. There are so many buyers—this broker, you know, doesn't care about you as the buyer 'cause there's like a thousand other buyers in the mix, so they don't have to care. Sure, maybe there are some brokers that are thinking about that, but unfortunately I don't see that sympathy in the market. And yeah, that's just my think, but maybe the others disagree.

[01:07:30]
Cash: I, uh, yeah, I mean, I met a lot of brokers with a lot of stories, right. The Sunbelt broker in Houston—he actually bought two businesses from Sunbelt. That's how he ended up buying the Sunbelt franchise in Houston—'cause he had such a good experience. Definitely knew what it was like to run a business.

I think, Steve, you also really need to look at—the reality is that most business acquisitions fail in transition. So there's a lot of that that's also outside of the broker's control and a lot more on the seller's side, which is why it's really that relationship with the seller that ends up being critically important. Yeah, I understand the question—whether these brokers really understand and care about the guarantees and what you guys are putting at the end of the day.

I don't know if that's really the full question that should be asked, though. Right? Because there's a lot of this transition success that depends on the actual current business owner and being able to set up a successful transition period. Most transitions don't die in the red paint after years. Most businesses die in the immediate transitions due to a lack of either forethought or follow-up on promises that were made. Which is why we make such a big priority on getting to know who these business owners are, setting up those relationships—'cause that's got a lot to do with this as well. So that's just kind of some thoughts that I have on the variety of broker experiences and what it actually takes to de-risk that transaction at the end of the day.

[01:10:00]
Athena: I agree with these two. And I think it's a good question to ask directly. But Steve, my inference from all the broker conversations I've had over the years is that they would prefer experienced buyers, right? Because there's less of a—the, it's an investment. You know, they don't really love the SBA process; they don't love working with individual buyers. They would rather somebody just show up with a fund and be able to, like, get it done and know what they're doing. I had a broker when I was like, okay, what, you know, how do you feel about buyers? And he's like, if they're writing me with a Gmail address, I don't take 'em seriously. And I was like, that's—but some of the highest net worth people I know write from Gmail addresses. So like, that's weird.

Many of the brokers are just like, why—why are you doing this? It's kind of this—not necessarily understanding your position, but confusing. Not understanding why you would want to do this when you're not an investor.

Okay? So it is the David and Goliath thing. Right? 'Cause their paycheck relies on somebody that knows what they're doing and getting it over the finish line. I heard a stat that 50% of the deals that aren't closing is because the diligence process wasn't managed properly. And the diligence process is on the buyer. So they've probably lost so many fees or had so many things happen to them on behalf of buyers not doing things well that maybe there's a lack of empathy there because they're like, well, I lose my fees. You know, my financial livelihood is dependent on this too.

But I love that question. We're actually reaching out to a couple friendly brokers that we know that also have a good landscape of the industry to bring 'em into Buyers Club, so they can talk openly and you can ask them questions. That would be a really good one to ask them.

[01:12:30]
Steve: I get it. I'm on the sell side all day long for 30 years, and so I get it. I want that perfect unicorn that has got budget, bleeding neck right now, and, you know, I want everything to line up. The reality is every single deal, I don't care how perfect it ended up, was messy along the way. So, you know, what I want and what I deal with to make money are two different things. And I try to understand too, my customers—what are their current economic challenges? What are their current global challenges?—to put in perspective. So, like you said, eloquently, meet them where they are, not where I want them to be. And then I go back to—I so appreciate the candor on hearing what they're thinking, what they're saying, because I gotta have that in my mind on my next broker call. This is what I'm going into. I gotta reposition to make sure that I stand out. So that's the value for me.

[01:13:30]
Athena: Yeah. I love thinking it—you know, I almost gamify it too, rather than being frustrated by it. This is something that I love that Luke does—he loves the difficult broker calls because it's an opportunity for him to turn them around, and he feels like it's a win when he does it. I kind of do that too. When we get on the phone—we're just talking on-market right now, but off-market—you know, they're getting hit up left, right, and center every five seconds from people and super wary and salty and everything. And I will just hit 'em with Athena-style kindness and I'm like, my goal is for them to be like, okay, I can't wait to have the next conversation. And that was fun. And I like this person. If I can get them to like me, then they're probably gonna end up trusting me as long as I follow through and I show up in a good way. And everybody—it doesn't matter who you are—you like working with people you like.

To get a salty broker, focus on winning 'em over. Sometimes the way that I would chill 'em out is like, man, it's hard for you guys. You have to sift through a lot of crap, don't you? And they're like, oh my God, you get me. So that alone can create an affinity. Having fun with it: okay, how can I win this guy over—or this gal? They've got a tough job. They're trying to wade through hundreds of people without a CRM, by the way. Most of 'em do not use any technology to manage this and find it very difficult.

[01:15:00]
Steve: So I'll tell you the last thing here—what changed from this call, being honest, I'm glad I joined this call, is I was about to drop a note on somebody to say thanks, but no thanks, and instead he texted me during this call, hey, any decision here? I actually texted PO: do not send that email right now. I'm going to, after this call, pick up the cell phone, call him and say, hey, here's where we are and here's why. I'll send you something formally, but I don't wanna blow the relationship 'cause he'll have more things to follow. And if it comes just an email over—so impersonal—I'd rather just have the conversation, whether it's good news or bad news. I think, listening to this, I think he'd appreciate that more, to have the actual conversation. And also I'll throw some sympathy in there too, saying, I don't want you to submit anything we've submitted to your seller, because I don't want you to blow that relationship between you and the seller. But I want to give you something formally so you can—you know, I appreciate the fact he does it by the book. Again, I learned something today, which is good.

[01:16:30]
Athena: Awesome. Steve, I love hearing that. Cash, were you gonna add something on—

[01:17:20]
Athena: Honestly, just being like, hey, thank you so much for the time, I really appreciate it—I know it's limited. I'm not the right buyer on this one. Wishing you the best, hope you find an amazing buyer, hope we get to chat again. And if they want feedback, they'll ask for it, and then you can give it to 'em. But you don't have to give them a whole song and dance—you know, like when you're breaking up with somebody, it's like, just rip the bandaid off and have the conversation. Team can help you with that too.

[01:18:30]
Athena: Oh, amazing. Well, this was fun. Really well done to Cash, Charis, and Luke too. It was an awesome summary. You guys should have seen 'em on the ground—I was so proud. And like, every person I spoke to was just like, your team is awesome, super excited about your buyers. I had a lender there that was literally dancing around—we're about to close our second deal with him—and he is like, I'll be your hype man. Everybody needs you guys. So the overall sentiment is like, if you're a first-time buyer and you have people like us—really smart decisions. So, not to toot our horn—you guys are already clients—but that's going a long way and shows your commitment to this process that you're getting the right people behind you, around you as you go through it too.

So Tuesday we'll be back with deal reviews. So if you guys are working on a deal and available, please jump on—love talking through that stuff with you live and in front of everyone. We've got a couple asks out for next week's Buyers Club. I'm actually gonna be doing an Acquiring Minds webinar next Thursday as well on building rapport with brokers and sellers. You guys get all of it straight from the source, but if you want to jump on that, it's gonna be one of the presentations that you're very familiar with—the pink slides and all of that high energy—so feel free to join. But we'll of course share all that with you directly and via the team. You guys are lucky that you get actual coaching on how to do all that throughout the process.

So stay tuned. We'll announce next week's Buyers Club. Team has some awesome deals that they're working on with you. Loving seeing the movement from everybody too. And have a great week and weekend in the meantime. Thanks, y'all. Bye.
