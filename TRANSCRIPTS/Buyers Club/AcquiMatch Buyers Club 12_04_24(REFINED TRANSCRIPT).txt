Title: AcquiMatch Buyers Club

[00:00:00]
Luke: Hey, Andrew. Hi, Alex.

Athena: How's it going?

Alex: Good. How are you?

Athena: Fantastic. We're excited for today. I think Polly might be on there, too. Um, so. Really excited to have you guys. This is not, um, all of the clients. I wanted the team to all be here as well, but we're going to record this. So I'm going to take you guys through the agenda today.

Um, and then we're going to have this as a standing meeting every Tuesday and Thursday. It will be the 1st of what I hope are many opportunities to bring all of you together and for us to support you through different things. Hey, Polly. Cool. I'm going to share my screen. Can you give me screen‑sharing permission? I took myself off from being the host and then I will get our little agenda started.

So cool. Thank you. All right. Can everyone see my screen? Yeah, cool. All right. So, um, welcome to the very first AcquiMatch Buyers Club. Um, like I said, we're going to meet every Tuesday and Thursday at 4 p.m. throughout December. And if you like these, then we want to keep it going. So, um, the reason why we wanted to do this is to give you a consistent time to get help with your acquisitions.

Uh, we wanted to expedite your journey with shared knowledge and learning opportunities also. Um, and then we thought you should be able to connect with each other that are in a similar stage. So all of you are completely awesome people. Um, and you can learn a lot from learning through each other also.

So we wanted to create a space for all of our clients to get together. All of you are serious because you're all here. Um, and honestly, I wanted more face time and to be able to stay connected with you all too. You know, wanted to be able to share knowledge and support there. So we've got our full team on today.

I wanted you all to meet them because I know some of them you haven't had the opportunity to meet yet. They're not going to be joining every single one. So in future Buyers Club, it'll be me and Luke and Ryan. So, Ryan, you're already familiar with. He's the one sending you all the deals and that you've been interacting with. He's our vetting director. But our newest member of the team is Luke. Luke, do you want to unmute and say hi quick and tell us where you're tuning in from?

Luke: Hey guys. Nice to meet you. I'm calling in from Southern California. Like, like Athena said, I'm pretty new on the team, so it's been fun so far working, looking at businesses for you guys and looking forward to doing more of that for you.

Athena: So, Luke is part of the vetting team, he's got a really impressive background in investment banking, um, and has also, you're going to be hearing from him more, he's done some of the videos for you also. Um, Ida is also a part of the vetting team, she is more support. Uh, Ida, do you want to say hi? Tell us where you're calling in from?

Ida: Hi, guys, nice to put faces to all of the deals I've been doing. I do all the chasing. I'm from South Africa. It's nice to meet everyone.

Athena: Ida is the one that is making sure that things get expedited. So her job primarily is chasing—she's chasing owners, she's chasing brokers to get all the information that we need so we can get write‑ups over to you. And Ana is our newest member of the team. So she is going to be my support and right hand. Ana, do you want to say hi?

Ana: Hi, guys, it's really nice to meet you. I'm located in Colombia. I hope that I will be able to help you and give you full support if you ever need it.

Athena: Awesome. Cool. And then, um, you all know Ryan, you speak to him pretty regularly. Uh, and then Anca, who, uh, is moving full time into operations and support. So she's going to be spending a lot more time on dialing in our systems to make them even more efficient and effective. So I wanted everybody to kind of say hi before we dive in.

Um, so what we're going to be talking about today, just some housekeeping in terms of like, how these will run, um, what to expect on these meetings, what's coming down the track. We're planning some pretty cool things. Um, we're going to do introductions with all of you so you can all meet each other and then wanted to spend some time at the end, kind of brainstorming topics that would be useful for us to cover in future sessions.

So you can start thinking about those things now and then we'll just do a little wrapping up. So first housekeeping. Um, we're going to be, uh, bringing in, uh, ideally, you all will have financial modeling templates that you can work on, LOI templates, um, things that we can talk about with your deal that would be useful for other people to learn through and maybe have feedback on, because you're all at fairly similar stages.

So you'll be able to learn from each other and through each other. So, um, what happens in Buyers Club stays in Buyers Club. It's really important that we maintain that confidentiality. Um, I'm so tickled with that pun and I'm probably the only one because it's so cheesy, but I think it's good to remember.

Right? So everybody has signed confidentiality agreements as part of working with us. So it covers what we're covering here. Most of what we'll be talking about won't be specific to the deals. And if we have documents that are related to the company, we might, you know, have you blank them out, but, um, everyone is working on completely unique deals.

There's no overlap. There's no competition. Nothing discussed here should be discussed or shared outside of the club because everybody's under NDA. So we want to make sure that that's all protected on these deals and circumvention is strictly prohibited. So that means if you see a deal and you want to go after it and you do go after it, that is like banned for life kind of material, so we don't do that. We're not—this is a safe space, trust space. So, uh, nobody really has, uh, overlapping kind of areas and stuff like that. But I just want to say it so there's no confusion down the line. So it's called circumvention if you circumvent people and try to go after a deal yourself.

So this club is for learning, collaboration, networking. Uh, for specific advice about your service or your deals or tech support, you're still going to keep using your individual channels. Nothing is changing there in terms of the support we were giving you there. We just wanted to give you an added layer of support.

Um, and if you can't make a session, that's no problem. We're going to record every one of these and upload it to the resources section of your dashboard. Um, we'll do a little summary of topics that were covered so you can dive in if there's anything in particular, and we might be like, oh, my gosh, we covered that recently on a Buyers Club meeting. You should go and dive into that to learn a little bit more and also we'll tell you what's going to be on deck in future ones if we're going to do a specific learning opportunity.

Um, and like I said, if you, uh, you know, nothing changes outside of this. Ryan, and the team are still available for 1 on 1 calls, but we wanted to give you a weekly reliable opportunity for questions and support.

So, what are we going to be doing on these? Some of you are in business buying communities, you know how helpful it is to kind of see other people's deals when they're working on it. So if you have an active deal that you're like, gosh, I would love to spend some more time talking about financial modeling, um, or, you know, what I should be including my—or something came up and I want to discuss strategy.

You can do that with us individually, but think about, like, would it be helpful for somebody else to learn through this? And maybe bring it here. And then, like I said, I'm going to be on as many of these as I possibly can. So, you know, I'll be able to dive into the modeling with you. The team are all really great at doing this too.

Um, so then we also want to collaborate and learn. So we want to, you know, have you be able to share ideas, ask questions, get feedback from the group. So everyone can chip in and you'll hear different perspectives and insights rather than us just talking at you. We're going to be doing focus topic sessions.

So, um, me, Ryan, Luke, or guest experts will pick topics every week to, um, go into deep dive with you. So you get some more kind of deep dive time. So it might not be something that's necessarily active in one of your deals right now, but we want you to upscale as much as possible so that when it does come up, you kind of know what's happening there. So things like working capital, capital expenditures, using ROBS as a potential funding option, all the different kinds of magical seller notes, things like that. And I want you all to think about like what additional topics would be really useful for us to cover and we'll brainstorm that a little bit later today.

Um, we'll also do industry updates. So, you know, we want you to stay informed of what's happening in the market, and we'll share any changes. Like, if the SBA does any changes in terms of how you can use SBA, if interest rates change, uh, any trends that could impact your search. Um, and like I said, start thinking about topics that you'd like to learn in the future, and we'll take a few minutes to brainstorm as a group later.

What's coming for Buyers Club is we're actually going to bring in some expert sessions as well. So we obviously have a lot of expertise. But we also have really great people that we work with and know that have expertise that we'd love to bring to you. And we're already asking them to come and do, uh, special topics with us.

So things like walking through a Quality of Earnings (QoE) report. What's in it? What should you expect? What should you wait for after that will be done during QoE. Those sorts of things. We're going to do a session on that, legal advisors and LOIs, and we're working hopefully to get some cool, you know, templates and resources for you, or tech specialists.

So we want to bring in folks to these sessions that you can, like, have a small intimate setting where they're going to teach you some stuff, but also you can ask all your burning questions as well. Um, and then obviously we're bringing you all together. So how do you keep the conversation going with each other?

We're going to be creating a specific Slack channel just for clients. It's going to be private, only for clients. Um, you'll be able to ask questions, offer advice. Um, we want you to be able to network and stay in touch in between sessions. So that's not going to be in absence of your individual channels, where we can do tech support and that sort of thing.

But, um, I, I've run many communities and I knew the 1st question that y'all are going to be asking is how do we stay in touch with each other and chat. So we're gonna be creating that hopefully this week. There's a little bit of tech behind the scenes that we need to figure out. Um, and like I said, we're gonna be building some more resources, templates, guides, tools to support you in your search.

Because what's most important for us is when we find you the one that you have everything you need to be able to win that deal and close that deal. So, okay, I've talked to you enough. I think it's time for some introductions. Uh, so you've met the team. We don't have all of our clients on this call. A lot of them weren't necessarily available.

So there's only a few of you, but don't worry in future sessions there will be more. But, uh, if you want to go around the group and let's start the knowledge sharing already and say your name. So, um, I'm going to share my screen and I'm going to ask you to tell me where you're located. And, you know, is there a big lesson, epiphany, or helpful tip that you've had in your business acquisition search process so far that you think would be useful, or something that was like, oh, my gosh, I wish I knew that before, that you can share with the group.

So I'm going to stop sharing my screen so we can see everybody's faces, but, um, so Andrew, Alex, Polly, Lindsay, all of you are the folks that will be able to do introductions now that we've done the team. Anyone want to dive in and go first?

Andrew: I'm happy to go. Um, hey, I'm Andrew Holder. I'm in Oklahoma City, located in the state of Oklahoma. The city part doesn't give it away. Biggest epiphany, I wouldn't call one particular thing, really just getting a lot more confidence in the modeling out and really trying to really understand.

I've got enough reps in now where I'm understanding how everything kind of flows with each other. And that's been really critical for me and knowing what lever to pull, just to kind of get it to tell me what I wanted to tell me. Also, with having the awareness, that's not always reality. I'm convincing a spreadsheet to tell me what I want to hear.

So, that's been really helpful. It's helped me a lot with that. Ryan's helped me a lot with that. Um, so that's that's been a big. Um, factor for me, I don't have a finance background. I have. Real estate finance background, but I do not. Um, small business finance a little bit different. So that's been a big, big hurdle for me.

Athena: I love that Andrew. So for those that might be a little bit earlier on in the modeling process, how did you get through it? Like, I'm sure it was frustrating at 1st. So what did you do to keep going?

Andrew: Um, I think just kind of recognizing, I mean, 1 of the biggest things for me was how a could be, like, what our finding, what our modeling is isn't always necessarily what the bankers’ modeling is going to be. Right. In regard to, you know, pre‑tax, post‑tax salary. Things of that nature, looking at that debt service coverage is that can vary depending on, you know, you want to have certain standards for yourself.

And if you can meet those, if you have the guidelines that are already set up in that tool, you know, at least the 1.5 DSCR, it's almost certainly going to cover any kind of DSCR requirements that a bank is going to have, because it's going through several passes, you know, taking out the taxes beforehand, doing all those things that some different banks don't always do on their models.

Um, and so it just kind of gives you a good buffer zone too, in the event that, you know, something might go sideways in the deal. Or at least I would think that that would be the case. Not there yet.

Athena: Nice. I love it. So what I'm taking from that is when you do your own modeling and using the template, which is super conservative, then whatever bank that you speak to, it'll probably cover the eventuality. So you can feel confident at least that if you're modeling in that one, that there'll be enough buffer to go out to the lenders. Is that right?

Andrew: Yeah, and I mean, a big deal too is the, you know, thinking about obviously we don't, you told me this and I agree full heartedly. You don't want to project anything further than a 3 percent bump based off. I mean, you're going to have certain some degree of a J curve. And at the same time, that's a very conservative estimate. I think we're all in the situation because we feel like we 3%. So, when you're building those out, have that as your base model, but also it's okay to go and make a copy of that and play with that, assuming that you can make some good headway in that business and hopefully be much more than that 3 percent in reality.

Athena: Yeah, love that. Um, so J curve, I think we've talked about this with all of you, but just in case we haven't is a term that describes the dip in revenue and profit. Usually that happens in year one, either because there's, you know, some fluctuations in terms of the sales, you might lose a customer, or you might be reinvesting into the business.

So your revenues and profits kind of go down, and then as you reinvest and as time goes up, then it goes up like a J. So, um, when you're doing your modeling, you wanna make sure that you're factoring in that there might be a drop in year one. And there typically is, this is typically what we see. Um, and then, you know, that's different than what the Internet's kind of telling you. They're not telling you about this. They're like, buy a business and it just cash flows like crazy. But there's some stabilization that happens after you take it over that you should be preparing for when you're doing your financial modeling.

So really good insight. Andrew. We're excited to have you here. Thank you. Yeah. Who would like to go next? Where are you? Who are you? What was a big epiphany or learning or, or tip that you would love to share with everybody here?

I can go next. Amazing. And also Lindsay, tell us about what, what's, what's active for you right now too.

Lindsay: Yeah. Um, so Lindsay, I'm in Austin, Texas. Um, I am actively marching towards, um, a landscaping deal here in the city. Uh, it's a design and build company. Um, you know, my tip or realization, I think, was, um, being able to imagine and see yourself in the business and really, like, putting yourself in the shoes of the owner versus.

Um, seeing everything as a problem I needed to be able to solve, including, like, what my day would feel like, you know, I can do that. I could do that. But do I want to do that? I think it sounds really basic and really simple, but when you've been searching, you're like, really wanting to make this change, it's really easy to go into problem solver mode, and by the time you're, you know, knee deep in a deal, you're like, wait, I've bent over backwards to try to make this happen. And it might be a good deal, but it's not a good deal for you.

Um, and I think that I don't know that I learned that lesson the hard way, but I, but I, I think until you can really imagine what it's like to own that business, it's, it's so important and you shouldn't abandon it. And so something that, that I've, I did with every review was I had a box that I'd fill out when I got it from their team of, you know, effectively my deal box, which is largely what we sent to Ryan. But, um, I did not do anything else. I didn't make any decisions until I filled out my box and like, how many of those things were still yeses or a 5 out of 5. If there was any two out of fives, do I really care about it? We didn't make any decisions until my husband and I didn't make any decisions until we did that. So it's really easy to abandon that. Um, and I think that's what kept me honest.

Lindsay: That would be my, my, my learnings.

Athena: I love that. When Lindsay and Kevin told me that they have their own little scorecard that they do to keep themselves from going into the falling in love with the deal. Um, and, you know, the first couple that come through, you do try to, like, fit yourself into it. And we had that. Um, also, uh, Lindsay and Kevin actually closed on an opportunity we found them in October. So this will be their 2nd takedown when this one closes, hopefully in a couple of weeks. We're looking at right—fingers.

Lindsay: Fast. Man. I guess my other learning is like, accept the chaos. It will happen. It's like, when do you close business? Like, I don't know. Um, I, I think that has largely a lot to do with how you fund your deal, but, um, you know, hopefully in the next few weeks, but before the holidays, it would be a little holiday gift to myself.

Athena: Yeah, um, Lindsay has a ton of learnings from speaking to lenders and lots of different lenders and like overcoming objections from lenders and stuff like that. So they've got a ton of really great experience here. Um, but the scorecard approach, I think, was really strong and it really stood out from them and how they approached it was like, really being honest with themselves and and helping us to refine their deal box by going through that process and then coming back and giving us feedback in terms of, you know, what, what would make a really solid deal for them. Because as we've talked about with everybody, it's like theoretical until you start looking under the hood on things. So I'm excited to have you here, Lindsay.

Um, okay, cool. So who would like to go next? Where are you? Who are you? And what's an epiphany tip or learning that you'd like to share here with the group?

Alex: Hi, I'm Alex Anderson. I am in Minneapolis, Minnesota, or a suburb thereof. Um, you know, the only tip that—so I'm very early in on this. So, the only tip that I can really, really think of, um, which is just sort of what I've been doing lately is when something is confronting and, um, just like, just push through. Like, there's, there's a whole, like, we could procrastinate and we could do all these other dances, but like, just—you might not know the terminology or whatever's going on. Just push through.

Athena: Yeah, lean on us and lean on our new little Buyers Club, too, to get you over it. Like, you're staring down the barrel at the biggest investment, probably one of the biggest decisions in your life. It's going to be scary. We're here for you.

You're doing great, though. Alex, uh, like you're learning super quick and you're moving through it. So it's been impressive to watch. So thank you for being here. Thank you. Cool. Polly or Jason, uh, who wants to go next?

Athena: Hey, so we're doing introductions with everyone—who you are, where you are, and if you have a piece of advice or an epiphany that you had about your search or a tip that would be useful to share with everyone here.

Jason: I was going to take some notes, but I think we got that covered.

Athena: Yeah, we'll have transcripts, notes, recordings for everyone on the dashboard after this too, for sure.

Jason: Yeah, I figure as much as we've got five note takers in here. Anyway, my name is Jason Brewer. Um, I am out of Atlanta, Georgia. Uh, I actually tracked down Athena through the contrarian thinking. I was like, I need that solution in my life. This is harder than I thought it was going to be. And he's going to be my wayfinder. So I've been in this group for about three, four months. Uh, I've been trying to find a business because I was 1st in real estate and then interest rates doubled and I was like, that plane doesn't work.

Uh, so I've been trying to potentially acquire a business. 1st, I had a very small net, then I expanded it. I think 1 of the biggest, uh, epiphanies that I have, um, to, uh, realize is this is going to be harder than I anticipated. I am a very ambitious person. Uh, I am one of those people that says affirmations to himself in the mirror, and I'm not going to hit that date, uh, which is fine.

So just kind of got to update those dates. And, uh, also, as I start to use the financial models, uh, I'm trying to, uh, kind of what the theme is suggestion, get more creative and how to structure some of these deals. Uh, I'm a big stock market person. So literally, if I don't see the revenue going up year over year, and if I don't see the profits going up year over year, I'm like bad deal move on.

Uh, so, uh, she's been very helpful with that, uh, Ryan as well. Uh, so I, I really appreciate their, their input and, uh, I like groups like this because, um, you know, I get to know that I'm not alone in this, this process is a little nerve wracking, uh, life hits you with, uh, some curve balls. And, uh, this group has kind of helped me kind of stay on track and aim towards my north star.

Athena: Love that Jason. Yeah, nothing like accountability, like something like this. So, um, so, uh, one of the things that came up with a deal we were looking at with Jason that I think would be useful to share with everybody is post‑COVID adjustments so they can mimic drops in revenue, but what actually happened with a lot of businesses is that after, you know, business basically stopped for some people in 2020–2021 and then in 2022, there was a lot of catch up that happened, especially in like, construction industries or anywhere where there was like, a backlog of things, or, you know, materials were really hard to get for a long time.

So if you're looking at 21, 22, 23 financials, you'll see 21 here, 22 will have a big spike and then 23 will drop and then you're like, Oh gosh, there's a revenue drop. What actually happened was a normalization. So 22 was like catching up on all the backlog of things that they didn't do in 2020, 2021. And then 23 went back to normal levels.

So when you see that, don't freak out. Think seller‑forgivable performance‑based note opportunity, right? So this is a tool that you are able to use only under certain circumstances with the SBA, where you can incentivize the seller to stay in, help you get numbers up to, um, a number that was achieved in previous business history.

So when you're using SBA, you can't do anything called an earn‑out, which is just incentivizing the owner to like spike sales. That's what private equity does. But if the company has achieved it in the past, then there is history. So now it's to your benefit to incentivize the seller to help you get those levels back up to what they were.

So actually that post‑COVID spike is an opportunity for you to make a more competitive offer that protects your debt service coverage if those numbers are not met after you take it over. So let's say, you know, 21, you had 8,000,000; 22 you had 10,000,000; 23 you went back to 8,000,000. You can make an offer based on the 8,000,000 baseline and then say, okay, if we can get revenue up to 10 million in the first year after takeover, I will pay you this additional money. And it's called a forgivable performance‑based seller note. If we don't achieve those levels, then that amount is forgiven and I don't have to pay you. So you're not at risk of like screwing up your debt service coverage ratio, SBA.

So I see the spike in 22 and the drop in 23 and I get excited because now I've just unlocked a tool that I can use, which is a really exciting tool because it protects you, incentivizes the seller, it's allowable by SBA and there's there's no risk to anyone apart from the seller. By not helping you get that business back to that level, they just won't get that money if they don't help you do that. Did I explain that in a way that made sense to everybody?

Okay, cool. So that's, that's what I'm excited about doing in these future sessions. And like, I'd love to do a future session on, um, different forms of seller notes. Cause there's like three different types that you can use. And one of those is that performance‑based forgivable note. And you can attach it to all sorts of things. You can attach it to customer concentration. You can attach it to, uh, key employees. You can attach it to anything that might be a risk in the business, which actually the SBA likes. Don't they, Lindsay? We've had some experience with this.

Lindsay: Yeah. I was just going to say, like, I don't think I will ever do another deal without one of these. Um, it's such an incredible incentivizer on both sides. Like you're both incentivized to make sure that that that performance level stays where it's at without it feeling contentious. It removes a layer of distress. It's like hey, we both want this to work right? Because it's your money. It's our money. Let's do this together. And then I have—there's been such a level of calm about the transition post close for my husband's business because of that note.

Um, you know, the, the, the panic that comes of like something happened with a client. It's like, well, that's fine. We've got a deal that kind of ensures us against the loss. And that went into the model too. I modeled down to like, I think it was a 20 percent loss and that ended up being the bar for how much of the note it needed to be because we had some customer concentration that we had to account for.

And like, it, it ends up getting both sides to the table of like, what's fair. Um, but, yeah, I don't think I'll ever do another deal without one.

Athena: Yeah, so. It's almost better to have that variability in the revenue for that reason, because you can't—if the business has just been on a steady growth and there's no like future or there's no past performance that you can tag that performance‑based note to, then you can't use it. Right? So a little bit of variability, especially if there's like a spike in any year, is a good thing. What we don't want to see is a continuing downtrend. So if you see that 21, 22, 23, then we want to look back a little bit further and see more historically what's happened with the business. And hopefully it's been, you know, slight increase, spike in 22 or 21, depending on when that COVID spike was, and then back to normal levels, but like a steady decline is something that is a concern.

And it's either like market decline or the business is just kind of losing market share and that might not be repairable. So, um, the numbers tell us different things based on what's happening and it gets exciting to use a performance‑based note, especially—had that deal just been structured. And this is something Lindsay knows well, and something I talk to you guys a lot, like, don't depend on the lender to structure your deal because.

You know, a lender sees customer concentration and they're like about, you know, but like, they're not thinking of performance‑based note, um, because they, they don't get to include that as part of their loan amount. Right? So the more loan that you're taking from the lender, the more they make off of it. So performance‑based note is actually just a loan between you and the owner.

Um, so they don't get the interest on that or anything. So they're not going to suggest necessarily doing your performance‑based note because it's like less money for them and/or they see customer concentration and they're like, whereas if you have a performance‑based note attached to customer concentration, and it accounts for the amount that revenue would be lost, like Lindsay was saying, then it protects you and it allows lenders to feel like it's less of a risk for them to take this on if the business can still stand up should a key customer leave.

So, it's, it's an amazing tool that I love so much, like Lindsay said, and the post‑transition, you know, kind of comfort and having you both bought into it is pretty cool too. And if the owner walks or doesn't do their job, like you're not—you don't have to pay them that money, you know?

Lindsay: I would also say Jason, something you've said of man, if it's not like constantly climbing, like I don't—I'm out. I've actually learned from quite a few lenders. They see a ton of deals where it does look like that. And it's because there's a lot the owner can do right before selling to like, make it look better. And they're intentionally doing it that way. So I don't think there's any, like, curve that pre‑close that looks ideal.

I think it's digging into, like, what's really happening. Um, because I think in both of the businesses, like, the first one we were just talking about, 2022 was stellar and then, like, a lot of catastrophes happened in 23, but, like, they're leveling out. Um, and so far, that's proven to be the case with the clients now that we've gotten in there with them.

Um, similar with the second deal. Um, there was a change. It is explainable. You can see in the books what the seller has done. And if you ask those questions and dig into like, well, why is, why is margin like 10 percent bigger from this year to this year? What explicitly did you do? If they don't have an answer, that's a red flag.

If they have an answer, they should be able to prove it. So, and having all of that already asked and answered prior to the lender conversation only helps you as well.

Jason: Yeah, that's a good point. That's kind of the, what I've seen in some deals where the revenue is going down, but operational efficiency is going up. So the SDE’s staying the same, which I'm like, are they out of levers to pull at this point? So they're looking for operational efficiency to keep, you know, SDE up so they can sell the business. And to your point, Lindsay, like, you got to kind of dig into that number a little bit.

Lindsay: Yeah, they just cut all their costs. So, when they hand it to you, it's mangled like—you know, I don't know. There could be a million explanations. Those are bad. So it's worth digging into.

Athena: In my experience and Lindsay, maybe you can echo this, but it feels like 98 percent of the owners are super honest and like not doing anything like that. They just—it's really hard to manage the books of like a multi‑million‑dollar business. So, usually it's explainable. It's worth exploring in a conversation, rather than eliminating a business just based on the numbers that you see, like, initially. Would you agree with that, Lindsay?

Lindsay: Oh, I would totally agree. Um, I think some of the ones—

Lindsay: I've got from you, I think from, from prior teachings, I would have immediately eliminated, but they ended up being incredible options once you dig into the why. Um, so, yeah, I would agree. I, I know there are instances and stories of owners being dishonest, but I think that's why this group, this community, the AcquiMatch team is great. Like they'll spot that before it gets to you. And if they don't, I think that's where like between you and the lender, whatever, you know, QoE you're doing, you'll, you'll be able to fish that out, but don't kill a deal before you get there.

Athena: Yeah, I'm excited to dig more into like the QoE report and like what you actually get in that and like what, you know, what's important pre‑LOI to look for. And then what do you get—like, you know, there's, there's different checkpoints, obviously, like having the lenders look at a deal first, you don't spend any money after you do an LOI and the lender will do a pretty extensive check. So if there's any major red flags, then you can eliminate the deal, if necessary, before you get to the point where you start spending money.

So then the next thing after a lender green‑lights it is then getting your QoE report, which, um, you know, I know it's it's an expense, but gosh, it feels really good to know that every penny that they said hit their bank account over the last couple of years is exactly as it is. And, you know, and then, you know, that team can, you know, show you any variabilities or fluctuations and help you with, you know, SDE adjustments and stuff like that.

So, um, we've had various experience, but I think that the providers that we work with now are pretty, pretty good. Have you gotten your—you've gotten the QoE report from your second one? Huh?

Lindsay: Yes. Much better referral—my 1st QoE was not, not a good experience. Um, I would, I would highly suggest anybody lean more towards people that offer fixed‑fee services than an hourly for these things. Doesn't mean anybody doing hourly is not good. It's just you have no control if they're not. So I learned that the hard way—to negotiate that bill down pretty aggressively. But, um, yeah, I, I think it's helpful to make sure that somebody who knows how to look at those things can tie out the cash.

Like, that was a big thing on the deals is making sure you can account for every dollar. And it seems kind of intuitive, but, but I didn't realize like the value of, of paying, “Hey, there's like a thousand dollars I can't account for.” That's not a big deal, but if there's a pattern of it over a couple of years, it's like, well, where did that money go? We need to go track that down. And I would never have known to look for that. I would never have tried to see it.

And during periods of transition, especially if you happen to do a stock sale, which I know is not the norm, but if you do, behaviors like that are really difficult to track down because you effectively hand over accounts from one person to the next. Um, which is also something I have experience with, but, um, it gave me a lot of peace of mind to know that what I was looking at is accurate, I can trust it, and you can even leverage some additional report, depending on who you're working with, of, like, “Hey, some of my early conversations had some weird, um, there were some nuances I couldn't quite uncover from the owner. Here's what I'm looking for. Will you please flag any instances of this to me?”

Um, and so on the 2nd deal, I needed him to pull out all of like the personal expenses that actually ran through the business, which actually ended up finding me a lot more SDE for me—the bank doesn't need to know about. Um, but that's for me to know what kind of a deal I'm getting. That has nothing to do with the books, the tax returns that the lender is going to use. So I'm walking into a way better deal on paper than on paper it looks like.

Athena: Love it.

Luke: Cool. This is fun.

Athena: Um, so with the time that we have left, I would love to hear what topics or discussion points—in addition to you all being able to bring, like, I want you to feel comfortable bringing your modeling or bringing an LOI or bringing a QoE report—like those things to talk through with the group and see if anybody sees anything too. Um, but in addition to that, what topics or areas do you feel like are blind spots for you right now that you would love for us to cover in future ones.

Andrew: You already, you already said this, you know, by just kind of seconding what you said—working capital and the cash cycle is always a very interesting topic, especially if it's got a long cycle. Some of the stuff I've, you know, looked at that you all have sent me—even the manufacturing space—I mean, it's just a long cash cycle and you might have half a million dollars of inventory sitting in the yard and how to structure that. That is just such a—that's a foreign concept to me and understanding how to, you know, not just a working capital, even like on the revolver, like a revolving line of credit and how to get that set up. And, uh, you know, at the level that would be necessary, you know, coming in with no experience and, you know, already being levered up with an SBA loan and going to a local bank to go revolving line of credit, you know, we're looking at those things and discussing ends and outs.

Athena: Yeah, I love that idea. Also, like, I can't emphasize it enough, but the brokers—like, some more sophisticated buying techniques and deal structuring is coming into small business land. But you'd be amazed at how many of these small business brokers, like, don't understand the concept of working capital in the deal. They think it should be separate.

So there's education that we have to do with you through that, where you're going to have to educate the broker and, and fight for this and negotiate this. Right. You either lower the purchase price or you have working capital included in the deal, because the business is not a going concern without that working capital functionality. So the reason why it is able to generate the profits and the revenue that it does is because it has that working capital capacity. So, to not extend that to the next owner means that they're kind of back at zero, which means that you value the business less, because if you add in the working capital on top of the purchase price, then you're overpaying for the business.

So, um, it's a really important discussion and something that, like, unfortunately, with a lot of the brokers that you're dealing with, they've been able to keep working capital separate in most of their deals for the majority of the time. So, I was just at—not just, I mean, it was a couple months ago now—but when I went to the Texas Association of Business Brokers annual meeting, there was a gentleman that did an education piece on working capital and for—I was listening to the brokers in the room and they were all grumbling at first, like “working capital is separate, blah, blah, blah.”

And by the end they were all like stunned, you know, it was the first time they were learning the concept of why working capital is required in order for the business to be valued at today's value. So yeah, absolutely want to dig into that. Spend some time on that. Might see if I can bring in an expert, but we can certainly start having that conversation and help you all with, with, you know, at what point do you start negotiating that and having the conversations? Um, and how do you have them so that you can make sure that you're not overpaying for a business, but still maintaining that relationship in a good way? A lot of times, it's just educating them so they understand, you know. Um, so we would add—

Lindsay: No, I would just add, he's making a really good point. I'm kind of in the middle of this now. It's—negotiating the number of the working capital is one piece, but then also making sure that you have in your agreement how AR is being calculated. Um, it seems obvious, but especially with longer‑term contracts or contracts where like it's percentage of completion, or there's not like a tangible deliverable to tie AR to, it gets really hairy, especially if the business owner has not been historically tracking AR that way.

So like right before close, they could, they could put whatever in and that's—that's your AR number now. So it's been a little bit tricky figuring that out for myself. Um, the number is one thing, but defining it in your agreement is another.

Athena: Yeah, and also allowing for variability. So, like, when, um, we had a client that put net working capital and made an estimate and rather than setting the exact amount, because the deal ended up taking so long, business ended up improving revenues by so much, which also increased the working capital by double. Right? So it was like 400 at the time of signing the LOI, but it was 800 by the time the QoE report came through.

Had they not included that in the LOI—the net working capital an estimate—then they would have had to come up with an extra 400, right, rather than agreeing at the LOI stage that, you know, we're making an estimate right now and it's going to be net working capital included in the deal. So, um, and also there's a lot of things. So, yeah, I agree. That's, that's a meaty topic I want to dive into. For sure. So thank you for the suggestion, Andrew. Anyone else—things that you'd love for us to cover or experts that we can bring in or topics that are feeling like blind spots.

Andrew: Just going to parrot back to you again, the quality of earnings—like what Lindsay was talking about—and just kind of walking through what one of those looks like and what they're looking for and how we can be a better hawk in looking at that stuff prior to. So we're, you know, as much as we possibly can be, not surprised by those findings. Um, if that's even possible without somebody doing a deep dive, but just trying to look for, you know, someone that can give us some “here's, you know, 5 or 6 things you can look for that are red flags that you need to get checked out.”

Um, just so you can kind of have an idea of what those problems might be that you might encounter during the diligence timeframes. I think that'd be very helpful to have somebody in to come and talk about that. That's not, that's not something you can find out there on the interwebs as much, you know, you can find examples of other learnings, but that's not what I've been able to find.

Athena: Yeah. Um, we actually already got a yes from, uh, Chris who Lindsay used on our second deal. So we're going to see how soon we can get him scheduled in. Um, he's going to do just that. I was thinking like, you know, five top tips to get right before you sign an LOI. Um, and then he'll, uh, we're still gonna work out the specifics, but I envision I'll have him, you know, walk through a QoE report that's been anonymized, so you could see what goes into a QoE report and what things that you will find out afterwards and what's important before.

So, um, I—they're fascinating and they're very in‑depth and they cover a lot of different things if you go with a provider that just does QoE. So I think it will hopefully also give you confidence and why paying for something like that from somebody that just does QoE is really important as opposed to, “Oh, my CPA said that they can do some analysis,” and like that can go terribly wrong. It can be really expensive if somebody is learning how to do something on your money and like not knowing how to do it.

Um, you know, the—the, uh, yeah, so, uh, especially in the community that a few of you are in, they're like, “Oh, the lender can do your financial due diligence.” And like, I wholeheartedly disagree. I think this is one of the most important things that you can spend money on throughout the process is just verifying all this stuff. So, um, great suggestion. Love it. Um, and yeah, the brief of like, what can you look for in advance, um, that would be able to be discoverable before a QoE—that would be like a deal breaker, something to work out—I think it's a great suggestion.

Cool. Um, anyone else? I was thinking like doing some, um, like the seller notes discussion, like, you know, what are the different types of seller notes that you can use and how to structure a deal? And what are all the tools in the toolkit to be able to like structure a deal? Um, and spend some time in the modeling template. We're going to be doing a like 2.0 version of that. We're working on it. Um, something that's a little bit more straightforward, but in the meantime, I think it's, um, a really good template to use so we can spend some time there. So what else would be good for y'all and be worth your very precious time to join or rewatch these sessions?

Lindsay: I think something that could have been helpful, and I think this varies by the person, but how to manage your lender or lenders. A lot of them are going to ask for the exact same thing in like a slightly different format. Um, I was so not prepared for the amount of like typing and retyping and re‑submitting documents.

That is a really simple way to like get yourself organized up front before you start like, kind of doing your pitches, I guess, to the lenders that you reach out to—like, what to ask for. You know, even like the revolving line of credit. A lot of lenders actually offer that depending on the type of institution they are. And if they don't, what do they offer and what are those questions that you should have ready. I mean, it might be helpful to just kind of hold that all together and have that be part of the kit, um, to, to be prepared because it's like a lot of them have you submit them through a portal and you filled out their form, but you need those questions like five more times.

It's like, create the template, save it, and then you can kind of, um, rinse and reuse as you go to different lenders and. There's just a whole time‑saving component there that's worth taking some time on, I think.

Athena: I love that Lindsay—such a great suggestion. Also something Lindsay said that like has stuck in my mind. She has a lot of one‑liners that I think about a lot, but she was like, I have never had to defend wanting to buy something so avidly before.

Can you speak more to that really quickly because I think it was, you know, people, people don't realize before they like go through this process but—

Lindsay: Yeah, maybe it was, it's just my experience, but I've never had to—usually you want to go buy something as long as like the baseline numbers check out. It's like, yeah, sure. Here you go. Here's what it costs. Some of these lenders just grill the heck out of you. Um, and they should, right—like they're about to invest in you. I think they're doing their job, but I don't think I fully understood the seat that they were in when I got started. And they're all totally different personalities as well.

And you kind of need to learn up front what kind of person you're dealing with and what's going to speak to them. Um, like, the, the two lenders that my husband and I use—totally different. Um, so it was a matter of what kinds of questions are they asking me and why so that you can anticipate their needs. The easier you make their job, the easier it's going to go for you. I learned that maybe on my lender 3, but I think it's, it's, it's, it's questions like, well, um, “Why do you want this business?” “Okay, but you've never done that before.” “Okay, well, what are you going to do if this happens?” Like, they'll just throw you curveballs to see how bad you want it. And I think that that's a good test of how hard you work to answer the questions.

But once you're past that initial, like, grill, they're your advocate too. They want it to close. They get paid if it closes. Um, but being really prepared up front can kind of make or break your experience.

Athena: Love that. Thank you, Lindsay. Super helpful. I might pick your brain for some tips when we do that particular session too, or maybe, maybe maybe a guest spotlight and just grill ya experience.

Lindsay: I can show you what I ended up like creating for myself and maybe you can adapt something like that. But it was like, it was, it was a lot of answering the same thing a lot of different ways.

Athena: Yeah. Yeah, for sure. And like the defending why you're the person to buy this business is like a big one that comes up again. So it's something that we try to talk through with all of you when we present a deal. It's like, here's what we're seeing is the through line between your experience and this business. Right? So, like, really getting solid in your own conviction that, like, yes, I can do this, even though I haven't done this before and here's why. Um, because that's what's coming next once you really want to, like, move and get funded on the business.

So I know we're coming up on time. Um, like I said, for the next one, hopefully we'll, we'll have a channel set up that we can connect to all, um, in Slack so that we can have these little discussions or share these little things that we're finding as we go through. Um, if you have any ideas on like additional topics that you want us to cover, like, please send those questions.

Um, and then as we get more of these people scheduled, or we have some topic ideas, um, we will let you know in advance. Um, anything we can do to make these more useful for you, do let us know. I know time is super valuable for all of us. We want to make sure that showing up is actually worth your time and helpful to you.

Um, and then if you have any, like, deals that you want us to review—financial modeling, LOIs, et cetera, et cetera. Um, send it to, uh, the email address that Anca is going to say now, cause I can't remember what it is.

Ida: AcquiMatch, um, at Undisputed Ventures, but I will drop that in everybody's channel, individual channels as well.

Athena: Amazing. And then we're going to, when we get that channel set up, I think we're going to just have a quick little form that you can fill out if you want us to spotlight you during one of the sessions too. So, was that a good use of everybody's time today?

Athena: Amazing. Well, we'll summarize all the learnings today. Um, we've got a million note takers as you all saw in the group. We'll repost this and then we'll let you know what's coming for the next one and then, like I said, we're already reaching out to, uh, folks that can come and drop in and do, like, deep dive sessions with you and answer questions, too.

So more to come. I'm super pumped. Thank you all for being here and being clients. And we're so excited to help you all get your dream businesses. So more of that.
