[Error #1 - Category: Misheard Acronym]
Location: Line 2 / Speaker: Host
Transcript excerpt: "Building Your Personal Buyer brand in AC of Searchers."
Issue: “AC of Searchers” is not a known term in ETA context.

Impact: Medium

[Error #11 - Category: Omission/Truncation]
Location: Lines 213-215 / Speaker: Athena
Transcript excerpt: "…they actually deliberated for longer than they should have like on."
Issue: Incomplete/truncated phrase (“like on.”).

Impact: Low

REMOVALS

[REMOVAL #1 - Type: Small Talk/Tech Check]
Location: Lines 31-34
Speakers involved: Athena, Host
Content excerpt:
"Athena: Okay. Can you see the slides? All right.
Host: Looks, yeah, looks great.
Athena: Amazing. Okay, cool."
Reasoning:
Purely technical check and pleasantries; no business content.
Context impact: None
Recommended action: REMOVE lines 31-34

[REMOVAL #2 - Type: Admin/Housekeeping]
Location: Lines 15-26
Speakers involved: Host
Content excerpt:
"…we're recording the session… a link to the recording and a link to Athena Slides on Monday… use the Q and A button… we'll do Q and A at the end…"
Reasoning:
Operational webinar logistics; not relevant to acquisition/branding substance.
Context impact: Low — Removing does not hinder understanding of the business discussion.
Recommended action: REMOVE lines 15-26

[REMOVAL #3 - Type: Admin/Housekeeping (Duplicate)]
Location: Lines 1734-1737
Speakers involved: Host
Content excerpt:
"…reminder that this was being recorded. All those great slides and the recording will go out… Watch your inboxes on Monday."
Reasoning:
Redundant admin info already covered earlier; no substantive content.
Context impact: None
Recommended action: REMOVE lines 1734-1737

BORDERLINE SEGMENTS (Requires Review)

[BORDERLINE #1 - Requires Review]
Location: Lines 1338-1358
Content excerpt: "Damien wants to know how Athena overlaid herself over the slides… when you hit share… person overlay over the slides… waiting room video… it’s a branding thing for me…"
Business relevance argument: Demonstrates presentation/branding tactics and on-screen presence strategy; ties to “pattern interrupt” and personal brand.
Personal content argument: Technical Zoom how-to is tangential to acquisitions and deal-making.
Recommendation: KEEP — It supports the session’s theme (branding/showing up) and provides actionable branding/presentation tips.

[BORDERLINE #2 - Requires Review]
Location: Lines 82-90
Content excerpt: "…scan that QR code… link to October 9th… using EQ to win over sellers and brokers…"
Business relevance argument: Directly related to the series’ Part 2 on EQ, a relevant acquisition skill.
Personal content argument: Event promotion is meta/logistical rather than educational content.
Recommendation: KEEP — It signals the upcoming, relevant deep-dive on EQ in dealmaking.

[BORDERLINE #3 - Requires Review]
Location: Lines 495-501
Content excerpt: "I want a Barbie pink Jeep… Not everybody’s going to want a Barbie pink jeep."
Business relevance argument: Serves as an analogy for targeted positioning/differentiation; supports brand concept memorably.
Personal content argument: Personal preference anecdote; not directly about deals.
Recommendation: KEEP — It’s a concise metaphor reinforcing the core branding lesson.

SPEAKER ATTRIBUTION VALIDATION
- Overall, turns and responses align (Host introduces, Athena presents, Host moderates Q&A). No clear misattributions found.
- Line 1204-1206 odd phrasing likely ASR error, not speaker swap.

PATTERNS/NOTES FOR ASR IMPROVEMENT
- Consistent difficulty with brand and proper nouns: AcquiMatch, FTSE 100, McCombs/UT, First Internet Bank, SMBash, McGuireWoods, Barbara Huson, Alex Hormozi.
- Occasional jargon/proper-name distortions: “buyer” → “Briar,” “Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo,” and numerical unit confusion (“days” vs “hours”).
- Acronym confusion: “ETA” misheard as “AC.”
- Recommend boosting entity dictionaries for common ETA/M&A ecosystem names and lenders; add post-processing for frequent phrases (ETA, SBA, LOI, buyer profile, FTSE, McCombs/UT Austin, First Internet Bank, SMBash, McGuireWoods, Hormozi, Huson).

CONTEXT PRESERVATION CHECK
- Removing lines 15-26 and 31-34 eliminates non-substantive webinar logistics/tech checks without creating gaps.
- Removing lines 1734-1737 avoids redundant admin note at close.
- All personal anecdotes retained serve clear business/branding purposes and maintain flow.
