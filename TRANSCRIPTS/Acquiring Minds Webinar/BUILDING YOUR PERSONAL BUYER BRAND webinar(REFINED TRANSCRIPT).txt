Purpose: Webinar on Building Your Personal Buyer Brand for ETA searchers

Will Smith (Host): Okay, welcome everyone to this webinar on Building Your Personal Buyer Brand in ETA for Searchers. My name is Will Smith. I'm the host of the podcast Acquiring Minds, and today's speaker is Athena Simpson of AcquiMatch. You may have heard Athena's name in a few Acquiring Minds episodes. She's helped guests on the podcast buy their businesses. She was a searcher herself, so she understands what it's all about, the risks, the costs, the heartbreak, the joy. I'm gonna hand the mic over to Athena in just a sec to do a proper introduction of herself.

Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): Uh, amazing. Let me go ahead and pull up my slides for you all and get presenting. I'm so excited to talk about this topic. Uh, it's something deeply personal to me and also something that you all are super up against right now. So we're gonna talk about that. Um, but before we get into that, who am I? Hi, I'm Athena Simpson. I'm the founder and CEO of AcquiMatch. We are acquisition matchmakers and we help turn first time buyers into business owners, one match at a time.

And just a little bit about me. 'Cause when I'm in talks, I'm like, who is this person? Should I listen to you? Um, I'm a 5x founder. I love starting businesses. Um, I have 25 years experience building, scaling and advising businesses. I've helped thousands of startups and founders start, scale and raise capital. Um, I've advised everything from Fortune 500 to FTSE 100 investors, government clients, uh, on their operations, innovation, investment, scaling across the globe. Um, former entrepreneurship lecturer at the McCombs School of Business here in Texas at UT. And as Will mentioned, I am the former fellow searcher, failed searcher. I've got the battle wounds. I'm gonna tell you that story in a second. Um, and I'm super active in the ETA community. I love this space. I love what everybody is doing. I'm so passionate about it, and I think it's such an amazing opportunity. Um, founded AcquiMatch in 2023. And fun fact, I have actually been teaching branding since 2012 when I was at Guinness World Records and I was creating products that we licensed and franchised out. Well, Guinness World Records is a brand—that's literally what its business is. So we had to teach people how to protect it, and I had to get them bought into why they should protect it. That made me fall in love with branding and it's a concept I've been teaching to founders and businesses and yourselves, um, for quite a long time.

So, um, this is actually part one of part two that we're gonna be doing. So go ahead and scan that QR code real quick. That's the link to October 9th. We're gonna be talking about using EQ to win over sellers and brokers. So today we're talking about the brand and how you're showing up. And that session is gonna be about how you're actually interacting, um, and using EQ because it's just as important as understanding the process is actually building that relationship and rapport throughout.

Today, what we're gonna be talking about is how you become a buyer of choice 101. So like branding 101 as a searcher, and then talking about how your strengths can actually be turned into weaknesses. How do you actually do it? And at the end, there'll be time for plenty of questions. Um, I'm gonna stay on and answer all your questions until Will kicks me off. So I'm here for it. I think we might go over an hour potentially. So, uh, cancel your next meetings if you're liking this conversation and have some questions. I wanna get 'em all answered. Um, okay, so what's going on right now?

The internet is going crazy for business buying and everyone's being told you can do this for zero money and you buy businesses and you get to go travel and sit on the beach while these businesses cash flow businesses or cash flow like cash to your bank account. Um, that is not the case at all. Reality is very different. However, what that means is there's a whole bunch of people that are getting these messages that are interested in business buying, which then—this industry, I liken it to entering the world's largest poker tournament and anyone can enter, right? So the small business buying tournament, you as a first time buyer—and this entire presentation is gonna be speaking to first time buyers, right? Because that's where the branding is really gonna come into play for you—you’re at a disadvantage 'cause you're up against people that have the experience, that have the team, that have the money to actually get deals done. And they've done it in the past. You're up against strategic investors. You're up against people that raised funds to do their search. You're up against private equity, you're up against people that have bought businesses. You're up against me and my team who search on behalf of clients as a first timer. And your goal is to try to get to the final table, right? And most of you don't have enough playing experience to even know how to do that. And then when you get to the final table, how do you do that? Well, psychology is a big part of poker, right? Psychology, perception—brand is gonna come into that. So think about that as you're going through this. This is one of those things that's gonna give you an edge in this tournament.

Real quick, my lesson in this: when I was searching, I found my perfect business. I saw myself running it. I had the experience and skillset to be able to take it to the next level. I had an amazing relationship with the owners. I had an amazing relationship with the broker. They were all cheering me on, even though I, I was first timer, didn't know what I was doing and asking price was $8 million. I was like, how did I even end up looking at a deal this big? I started out on a hundred thousand dollars laundromats like the rest of you probably did too. So it was this big girl deal that I had no idea what I was doing. There was no advisors or anyone like me or, you know, content out there on how to actually structure this or what to do. And it was an amazing deal. So there were 14 other buyers in the mix, most of which were experienced buyers of businesses. So I was, you know, the David in this Goliath situation, but they wanted me to win because of the brand that I put out there and how I interacted with them.

Um, and when it came down to it, they're like, look, we believe that you can buy this business and would be a good owner of it, but there's a question mark of whether you'd be able to finance it or not. And I was like, don't we figure that out after LOI? And they're like, no, uh, there are people that can actually buy this business and have the money. I was like, okay, what do I need to do? Go talk to broker. Introduced me to the banker that he liked. And he's like, if the banker tells me you can do it, then I will keep you in the next round after the cuts. He's like, okay, go to the banker. He's like, what do I need to do? And he basically told me I need to raise $3 million to make up for the risk that they were gonna have on an air ball like this. It was high growth business, lots of risk. Lender, I, you know, was looking out for their own interests in this. I didn't know it at the time. Went to the broker and I thought I'd done such a good job at building up the brand. I was like, Hey, so I know I'm the chosen buyer, I just need some time to go raise $3 million. And he’s like, okay. Um, you can have until Wednesday. And I was like, but it's Friday before a three day holiday weekend. And he’s like, I don't know what to tell you, Athena. There's other people that can actually get this deal done.

So here I was thinking that I was the strongest person in this mix and I was now at a situation where I was gonna have to raise $3 million in five days over a three day weekend. And I did it. I, I, I went out and I raised that money and I thought for sure I was gonna get that business. And I ended up not getting it because my offer was 2 million less than somebody else in the mix that knew what they were doing with structuring. And they actually deliberated for longer than they should have. They really wanted me to be it. But they ended up choosing someone that offered them 2 million more. Um, I wouldn't have even gotten to that stage had I not focused on my brand, the story, the interactions I was having with them. Um, I had no business being in that, but I did because of how I showed up. Um, so off the back of that, I ended up starting this business because I was the right owner of that business, hands down. But I wasn't the right buyer. And that's really important to me. That's why I am here. It's why I do this. It's why I started my company. I think there's a lot of first time buyers out there that are gonna make amazing business owners, but they need to be helped to become the right buyer. And that's what you need to think about. You need to be thinking about how am I the right buyer of this business in addition to the right owner.

What you're up against. There's not great perceptions of first time buyers out there, especially since the internet has caught wind of this. You are being viewed through the lens of a first timer that probably has no money. They're gonna be a headache. They're not gonna have the grit to get this done. They're gonna get scared. They don't have the right support behind them. They're not gonna be able to close. These are the things that brokers and owners and lenders are thinking about. You, you have the, the deck stacked against you even being a first timer that's never bought a business. So this is the perception that you have to overcome with your brand.

You also need to think about where you stand in this, right? Like, I can't tell you how many people are like, broker was mean or shut me down or didn't respond to me. Like, know your place, right? People are broker bashing, but you probably don't know what you're doing. And when they put up a listing, they get 200 inquiries in the first hour. Many from qualified buyers that have done this before. Okay? So eat a piece of humble pie. We're gonna go through how you can actually show up as somebody that authentically is a first timer, but as someone that gets chosen. You are being vetted every stage of it. How you interact, how you show up, your timeliness, how people feel about you. So it is important that you're thinking about that with every interaction that you have with every service provider, lender, broker, et cetera. They are vetting you. Do you have what it takes to get it done? Because 20 to 50% of deals that don't close after LOI are due to buyer issues and competency, getting scared, et cetera. So you're more than half the problem, right? And they know that and their paychecks are relying on that. So let's talk about how to become the right buyer through the lens of branding.

Every time you interact with someone—and look at this through the lens as a business owner too, right? Like personal brand and business brand. There's a lot of these things that, that, um, can relate. When you put out a piece of, uh, content. When you interact with someone. When you reach out to someone, the automatic response is always, so what, when someone sees a piece of, uh, like advertisement. So what, what's in it for me? People do not care about you. They care about what you can do for them. And it's not that people are bad, that's just literally how we're wired for survival, right? Like, what's in it for me? How can I take care of myself first, even if people are big hearted and look out for people, et cetera. So if you could think about the psychology of what people are thinking when you interact with them, you can use that to your advantage. How can I communicate what's in it for this person? How can I think about what's important to them as I go through this?

People wanna be a part of something. People wanna know why you're doing what you're doing. When Kennedy had the space program and they were trying to put a man on the moon, it was, it was a crazy idea at the time, right? He was touring the space station, um, and like where they were working on getting a man on the moon and he saw a man mopping the floor and he went over to him and he said, what are you doing? A man said, I'm helping put a man on the moon. That mission was so well understood that the person cleaning the floors understood their unique contribution to something bigger than themselves. When you can think about why you're doing it and what you can do for somebody else and how you can paint that big picture of what the mission is and how that person's involved in it, you give them purpose, you give them meaning, you get them excited about you. I wholeheartedly believe that I was able to raise $3 million because people wanted to be part of doing something absolutely crazy and incredible and support somebody that was crazy enough to go out and try to do it, right. Um, people get excited about that.

So that's—when you're thinking about brand, it's not logos, it's not imagery, it's how you make people feel. Brand is the personality that people think of when they interact with you and how you get them bought in to the mission is a big part of that. And this is like marketing branding 101. You cannot get somebody to buy something from you—and make no mistake. You are, you are selling. If you are buying a business, you are in the business of selling. You have to sell yourself to the owner, to the broker, to the lenders, to everyone that's interacting with you to get this deal over the line. And if you don't like selling or don't see yourself doing selling, you probably should question whether you should be a business owner. 'Cause even if somebody's doing the sales, guess what? Chief Revenue Officer, you gotta make those loan payments. You are in the business of selling. People will not buy from someone that they do not know, that they do not like, and that they do not trust. So when we know this, then we can think about when we're interacting with someone, how do I get them to know me, be familiar with me in the first place? Do they like me? Am I being likable? And this isn't like, I don't talk about anything that, um, I don't believe that you should manipulate people or lie. Everything that I'm talking about is authenticity, right? Which comes down to trust. If you're not being authentic or if you have a motive that you're not being clear about, people will automatically not trust you. They're not gonna buy you or choose you as the buyer if they don't trust you.

So when all first time founders, uh, got this wrong, right? And I did too until I understood this concept. As you, you know, think of yourself as—this is a business enterprise that you're taking on, you are going through an exercise to become a business owner. Whether you're starting one or buying one, there's still an element of thinking of what is my brand and how am I communicating that and how am I getting there? When new brands start out, they'll start talking about how great they are. And remember people are thinking, so what? It's like, cool. You're talking about how great you are. Like I don't care.

Um, there's this amazing book called Building a StoryBrand, which talks about the role you play in someone's world when you want them to be a customer, when you want them to buy from you. They are the hero and you are the guide, right? So think about Cinderella. Cinderella was trapped in her horrible house with her sisters and her mothers. They tore up a dress, they were making her do all these chores. She desperately wanted to get out. Um, and here shows this guide, right? And she's like, Hey, um, so I can Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo you, I'm gonna put you in this pumpkin over here. You're gonna go meet a man that's gonna change your life and you're gonna get out of this horrible situation. This guide had arrived and told her how to get out of the horrible thing or get the success that she wanted, right? And I guarantee you, if the fairy godmother was selling the Bibo boo, Cinderella would've been out there like auctioning off her mice friends for like animal testing to make it happen, right? So if you connect to what somebody wants and how you can help them do that, they're gonna do whatever it takes to get you there. So in this sense, obviously as a first time buyer, you're not the guide, but you are someone that could show up and help your hero get what they want. The owner that wants to make sure that their legacy is maintained. The broker that wants to make sure that their client is handed over to somebody that's gonna look after them and they're gonna get their fee after 12, 18, 24 months of working for free for this person, right? So think about that. Position yourself as the guide and how you're helping someone get what they want or avoid failure as opposed to you being the hero. And I can tell you what, if you do that in your life and in your business when you're doing marketing branding, it is such a shift.

Additionally, you wanna think of the value perception of you or what you're selling. And in this case, you're selling yourself, right? So people want to buy what they perceive as having value. Well, what creates value? I stole this from Alex Hormozi, this was in his a hundred million dollars offers book. The whole series is incredible, very great, uh, frameworks for businesses. The value equation is talking about what is someone's dream outcome. They want to, you know, sell a business. If we're talking about a broker, they wanna get that fee, then we multiply that by what is our perceived likelihood of achievement. So when a broker's thinking about who they're choosing, they're thinking about who's most likely to help me close on this business. I need to choose the right person that's gonna get me that achievement of my dream outcome. And then we divide that by the time it's gonna take that person to do it and the effort and sacrifice they're going to have to make. So as a first time buyer, you are adding time 'cause you're figuring it out and you're adding effort and sacrifice 'cause they're gonna have to help you figure it out along the way. It's harder for them to work with someone like you and that's gonna lower your value because it's going to decrease their perceived likelihood of achievement, of getting their dream up, right? So when you're thinking about these things, how am I connecting to what their dream outcome is? How am I connecting to what their likelihood of achievement is? What that means, how they get their achievement? And then what is the things that I can do to decrease the time and effort and sacrifice of interacting with me? And that will increase your value. Okay?

So we're talking about brand, right? And, and I do not think that a brand is your logo or whatever. I mean, obviously it's a component of it, it's your personality. What many of you are doing is you're putting yourself out there and you look like everyone else, okay? I can rattle off your searcher website right now. We believe in honoring legacy and protecting what you've built. And we're looking for 500K to 1 million in SDE, stable and growing business in existence for at least 10 years in a, like, stable or growing market. Like your criteria is all exactly the same. So when someone's going to buy a car, right? Like, here's a lot of the options right now when someone's going to pick a buyer out of the mix, if you're showing up like this, you're not standing out, you sound like everyone else, which in effect lowers your credibility, right? Because you're just cookie cutter, putting yourself out there with your, you know, whatever capital website and it looks, you know, and you got those like blue, blue and gray colors. And unfortunately it's not gonna help you. So when you're building a brand, you wanna think about like, how can I be the exotic car in this scenario, right? And it's not out of an authenticity. You need to be the right—this car isn't gonna be for everybody, right? I, I, I wanna, I want a Barbie pink Jeep. Like that is the car I want. It's the dream car I've had since I was a kid. I want it someday. Not everybody's going to want a Barbie pink Jeep. So you gotta be the right car for the right person. But the more you like, think about how am I standing out and being me and making myself unique so that when that person is like, ugh, that's—that's the buyer that I want, that's the person I want taking over my business. That's the person I wanna work through with this, you're denying yourself that opportunity by putting yourself out there like everybody else out there, okay?

How do we do this? First, before you build a brand, you gotta know your audience and who you're selling to, right? This is something that a lot of first time founders get wrong and something that a lot of people get wrong. They think of, okay, well what do I think will be good? It's like, well, you might not be your audience, right? So who are your audience you're dealing with? Brokers, sellers, and lenders. These are, these are your stakeholders. What are their objections to you as a first time buyer? And what are you gonna do about it? Okay?

So the first and biggest objection is, do they have money? Can they actually finance this deal? How you overcome that as a first time buyer: well, go and get SBA prequalification. See if you can get someone to say what your buying power actually is and have a lender look at you and share that upfront. Do your homework. Know what your buying power actually is. Know how to structure it. This is where I really fell down on myself. I didn't know what I was doing or what my buying power was, and there wasn't anything out there at the time. There's tons of resources now. Have your personal financial statement ready to go and put in front of them. And if you're hiding that because you don't have any money, stop searching right now and go figure that out. If you don't have money to buy a business, you should not be buying a business. So either you need to figure out how to use other people's money and have that backing before you get into this. Or go and work, save up your money and come back when your balance sheet's gonna look better. Because I tell you what, it is not something that should be faked down the line and it is not something that you can figure out. Like go figure it out. And I know it's tough because people were being told you could buy a business with zero money, but honestly, I don't think it's a responsible thing to do. So have a real, real look at your money situation too.

Um, the signal that you have overcome this objection is that brokers introduce you to their sellers and lenders get excited about working with you, right? So there's gonna be signals that we're gonna see when we overcome those objections. And I've just picked a few to go over. There's clearly a million, but these are the main ones.

The next objection that people have is, is this person going to get it to the finish line? Do they have what it takes? And I can tell you what, you are gonna be tested unlike anything probably that you've done in your life when you try to buy a business, right? You listen to all of those episodes. There's, there's challenges that comes up so often and you're staring down the barrel of a multimillion dollar personal guarantee and potentially bankrupting yourself and losing your family home if you don't get this right. Your demons are gonna come up, right? And oftentimes it's those demons that stop the deal from going forward when you're a first time buyer. So you are being vetted through that lens. They wanna see if you have the grit and resiliency it's gonna take to get a deal done. And that will also tell them whether you have the grit and resiliency it takes to be a business owner. 'Cause I can tell you right now that having a W2 is like being on vacation. A paycheck just shows up in your account every month, right? That is not a luxury you get as a business owner and all of the decisions in that business are on you as a business owner. It's a crazy thing to wanna be a business owner and be like, take responsibility for all of these people's livelihood and make sure that I'm making the right decisions every day to make that happen. It's terrifying. There's nothing wrong with being in a W2 and earning a paycheck. It's a wonderful relaxed life. Business ownership is not relaxed. So if you think it's just like buy a business and have someone else operate it, no sir, it does not happen that way.

So anyways, they know that, right? And they've seen a bunch of people come show up, think it's gonna be easy, they don't get it to the finish line. So when you wanna overcome that objection: first, communicating clearly and quickly. If they are asking you for something, get it back to them as soon as possible. You always wanna be putting the ball in their court, which shows that you will have momentum and you will prioritize this. Corporate time and deal time are two totally different timelines. So get out of corporate time, get into deal time, and it signals to somebody that you care and that you're gonna do what it takes when you are responding quickly and getting back to them quicker than they're getting back to you. I like it when somebody always has the ball in their court because it means like I'm lobbing it back. I'm not—they're not waiting on me.

You wanna read the room with EQ, okay? Just knowing how a deal is done is not going to get you over the finish line. There's so much rapport, relationship building, EQ that is required to do this well. So much so that we're gonna do a whole other series on this on October 9th and talking about this, because honestly, it's the thing I spend the most time with the clients on is how to do that. How to do it right. You can tell a story of persistence, something you overcame, grit that you had to get them to buy into you, okay? Maybe you haven't been a business owner before, but what's your hero's story? What did you overcome? What's gonna demonstrate that you have grit? I can tell you what—I don't think anybody else has raised $3 million in five days to buy a business. When I did that, like everybody was like, God, if you did that, like what are you gonna do as a business owner, right? Like it showed that I fought. And I have all sorts of—like, one of my favorite things is a phoenix rising from the ashes. Like I will pick myself back up again. I will face challenges head on. I'm a buffalo, I run into the storm. I'm not a cow, I don't run away from it, right?

Um, and get the right team and advisors. Rent, buy, borrow credibility where you need it and understand where your limitations are. Buying a business is a completely different skillset to owning a business. And unless you're wanting to do this multiple times over, then get the right people around you who can help you get the win. And that signals credibility. It signals that you have skin in the game. It signals that you're serious to the stakeholders. Um, and the signal that you are helping that, that people think that you have what it takes to get it over the line is they start making effort to help you. That broker gave me time to go raise 3 million. I can't imagine being on the other end of that phone call and this girl's just like, Hey, so can I make some time to go raise $3 million? And he's like, what? Like, and he actually gave me time, you know. So when they start making effort to help you, they believe in you. They believe in what you can achieve, they're excited to be involved, right?

And then the last objection I'm gonna touch on today is, will they make a good owner? Leading with your values in conversation, talking about why ownership matters to you, connecting yourself to the business that you're looking at. I can't tell you how many brokers are like, what? Why do you want this business? Like you're in tech and you're looking at landscaping. There's, there's, I think this like, uh, Gen Z like, like vibe buying businesses or vibe coding or whatever, like vibe thing. Like you just get a vibe and you wanna like buy—I’m not using it well 'cause I am, I'm an elder millennial. Um, almost, almost X. Um, so yeah, but like there's a lot of vibe buyers out there and it's like, well, why do you actually wanna buy this business? So you need to connect yourself to the business even if you don't have relevant experience. What about you is going to be relevant for this business? What's gonna make you a good owner of that business and truly audit and understand why you'll be a good owner?

Look, not everyone should be a business owner, and I think you really wanna get real with yourself. As I mentioned in the previous, it is—it is tough, right? All your demons come out, all your weaknesses are shown to you on a daily basis. It is tough. It is really hard to keep going. You need to understand what's gonna make you a good business owner and be able to communicate that. And if you feel like you're not quite there, go out and get the skills and experience to help you get there. Show consistency and professional presence. So like, if you're talking about being a business buyer and I go to your LinkedIn and all I see is you talking about being an amazing tech salesman, there's a disconnect. So now I'm like distrusting of your brand because there's not consistency. Um, how you show up and interact with people also makes an impression, right? So as a business owner, how you interact with people, your team, customers, et cetera, like you're being vetted on your interactions with people. And then the last thing is like really start obsessing about business ownership. I get really scared at how many people that have never been a business owner are trying to buy a business and are not just learning about how to buy a business, but they're not learning about how to be a business owner. And I tell you what, like you got a bunch of great advisors around you getting it over the finish line, and then you become a business owner and you're on your own. You're on an island trying to figure it out. So start learning and better yet, go work in a small business. You want landscaping, go, go be a landscaper for a day. Um, that'll give you a hell of a lot of credibility with the stakeholders that you're actually taking those opportunities to try it out before—try before you buy. Um, so the signal that this is working, that people think you're a good owner is that sellers talk about you as the buyer they can see running their company. Um, brokers tell you that the sellers like you, the lenders wanna back, right? Like it's—the J curve is real. It's real that people will take the business after they buy it. There's so much challenges that come up. So like making people believe that you're gonna be okay with all of that after the transaction is really important.

Okay, real quick, I'm gonna whistle stop tour, turning weaknesses into strengths. So you're—I tell this to my clients all the time—your weaknesses are actually your strengths. There's always a way to reframe it, right? People like supporting the Davids, people like cheering the little guy on. So you can think of, well, let me be real with what my weaknesses are and how do I turn 'em into strengths? This is not something you can turn into a strength, right? Rule number one is don't be rude to people. Don't be an a*****e. We turn clients away. If people are rude to us, lenders will turn you away. The brokers don't wanna deal with you. I can put the most amazing business in front of you and have you become the business owner. And if you're rude to people, you'll ruin that business. People don't wanna work for someone that's mean to them. Customers don't wanna interact with someone that's mean. So kindness is something you can do for free. And this is something that I think as a whole country we need to think about, right? Like if you're riding people and tailgating them and honking at them and being mean to 'em, like you're showing up that way. And if you have all that anger, stop searching, go get a therapist, heal yourself, right? And it comes up, we have triggers. I have a business therapist. I think everybody should as a business owner, like you're gonna be tested. But if you automatically just show up and you're rude to people, you need to go deal with that first before you look at business ownership. Because it doesn't matter how good the business is, you're not gonna do well with it and people aren't gonna wanna work with you. I was just on the phone with a lender the other day and he's like, Nope, won't touch 'em. Like, we won't either. So you're not gonna get very far if you're not nice to people.

Um, it's okay to be industry agnostic, but you need to stand for something, right? So something that I used when I was going through my search journey was my parents' story of, um, they were business owners. Um, they had a really successful construction management and construction business. When they wanted to retire, they shut it down. Then after that, my dad had a heart attack. He's okay. Um, but they were out of the country. So they ended up spending a lot of their nest egg on medical expenses. And now that nest egg isn't, isn't so plentiful. And knowing what I do now, they could have sold their business. Um, so when I was looking at businesses, I wasn't sure what I wanted to look at, but I knew what was important to me was, was taking over something from somebody and helping them get rewarded for all the hard work that they put into it. And me doing it justice as the new owner. And I told owners my story and that connected them to me authentically. It wasn't—it wasn't not real. It was 100% real. And I'm so angry I didn't know about all this sooner to help my parents, right?

Um, this is a big one. Like, do not pretend you know more than you do. And I'm looking at you people that are setting up your like capital or ventures, companies, you know, websites, that sort of thing. And hands up, I did it too. I—Unrestricted Ventures was like my thing and it did me a disservice because they were like, so who are your investors? What's your fund? Dah, dah, dah, dah. Like, I wasn't a fund, I was a person. So, you know, like, I get it. You feel outta your depth. You feel like you need to show up like a, like an expert. And honestly it does you a disservice because when they start digging into it and you don't know what you're talking about, it makes them trust you even less as opposed to like, hi, I'm Athena. Um, I am a multiple, you know, founder, business consultant. I love being a business owner and I wanna be a business owner. And I'm, you know, first time doing this so—that people can get behind because it's like, okay, you're being real with where you're at, but like, hey, here's what I'm doing about it. I'm learning. I'm getting the right advisors, I'm doing everything I can to make this as easy as possible for you. It's okay to admit when you don't know what you're doing. And actually the best business owners are the ones that do that.

Um, okay, I'm big on pattern interruption if you couldn't already tell by like the leopard print in the background and the pink. Um, so when I lived in London for 10 years, I dealt a lot in the finance industry. We all wore black and we were miserable there. And as I was leaving London, I was like, man, I don't even have any light left in me. I'm never dimming my light for anyone again. I choose to dress this way. This stuff makes me happy. I'm not doing it to get a reaction out of people, it's just what makes me feel good. Not everybody's going to like somebody that has a bunch of big cats behind her and wears leopard print and, um, but you make yourself a magnet when you are authentically you and you choose whatever it is that's a pattern interrupt, right? In the sea of blue websites of, you know, buy-side advisors, like here we are in pink and leopard print. Like it's intentional. We call ourselves acquisition matchmakers—intentional, right? I wanna be a pattern interrupt because we are not like everybody else, which means I'm going to attract people that are interested in what we do and how we work, and I'm gonna repel people that are not my people.

Quick story for you. Right after I raised that 3 million, I was like, that was awesome, I wanna do that again. And I got really excited about independent sponsor models. Went to the Independent Sponsor Conference, knew that there was gonna be a whole bunch of finance people there, thousands in fact. And from my days in London, I was like, it's probably gonna be blazers and sport coats and blue and black and blah. It's like, okay, I showed up in leopard print dress and rhinestone cowboy boots. Did a lot of people not take me seriously? Absolutely. Did a lot of people come over to me and they're like, you're different. What's your story? I'm like, I just raised $3 million in five days. They're like, tell me more. I walked away with so many people that were like, you're awesome. I wanna back you when you get a deal. Please come and talk to me. Those people have given me a ton of time and advisory and actually been amazing support to my clients as a result of that. I attracted people that were interested in me. I repelled people that were like, ugh, that print. Like, okay, um, not my kind of person. You know, I like injecting fun. One of our values is the joy in the journey. So, um, that's all to say is like, be yourself, but authentically yourself. And don't be worried about looking differently than everybody else. We all know, um, Jared Johnson, right? He's First Internet Bank, SBA lender because he has a big cowboy hat on. You see him at every event, you know who he is. Um, that's a pattern interruption. It's okay to do that, but make it authentic to you.

Um, you're not a fund. That's a good thing. Your weakness is your strength. And I can't tell you how many of my clients are chosen, even though their, uh, offers are less money because they are an amazing person—because they engaged with them authentically—because that owner wants them to be the owner, not the a*****e PE guys, right? It's a good thing that you're not a fund. It's a good thing that you're not, like, private equity and experienced investors. That's what these owners want to take over. So put yourself out there as a buyer and tell everybody. A lot of you are in hiding, right? You have a lot of real estate on your email signatures, LinkedIns when you're talking to people. The way I was able to raise money that quickly was because I was literally—as soon as I found out about business buying, I couldn't shut up about it. Like, I don't care who you were, I was talking to you about it. And then I had a bunch of people that were interested that I remembered and I was like, I'm gonna go back to them. Tell everyone, you never know what can happen, but if you're not telling anyone, are you really serious about this?

So remember this, if nothing else: when you interact with people, when you send 'em a message, when you have a conversation with them, when you put a piece of marketing material out there—what do you want people to think as a result of receiving that? What do you want them to feel and what do you want them to do once they get that? Okay? So for this webinar, I want people to think, wow, I didn't realize I could be myself and be effective in this. I want them to feel relieved and excited and ready to go out there and put it out there that you're gonna be a buyer. And I want you to become a business owner. I want you to do the things that are gonna help you be a business owner as a result of this, right? So when you're thinking about what do I want people to think, feel, and do, then it makes you more measured and, and clear and consistent in how you're interacting with people.

And lastly, you can borrow credibility, right? Build a team to overcome your weaknesses. My team included. When we reach out to brokers and lenders on behalf of one of our buyers, it's instant credibility. Um, so there's a bunch of great people out there. You—leopard print and pink—might not be your flavor. That's cool. There's some other ones that have the blue that you might like.

Real quick in the brand toolkit—what should be in the brand toolkit. This is like minimum: have a resume that's relevant to being a business owner. Better: make a buyer profile, and I'll show you some headlines in the next slide. We'll be sending out the slides too, so you'll have all these headers. Um, but a buyer profile that demonstrates why you'd be a good buyer and a good owner. Best is if you have that buyer profile, you've put it in your LinkedIn headline that you're buying businesses and your bio. So there's consistency because guess what? You are gonna be Googled, right? And they're gonna be looking for it. If you're not putting it out there, are you genuinely serious about searching?

Nice to have, but not at all necessary, is a website. This is something that I think a lot of people think they need for credibility. I don't agree. If you have a buyer profile, if people experience you as someone that's credible and that can get this done, then the website, you know, okay, whatever. But like, make sure your website is you and different and, and communicating your story and your journey and your mission. Um, but you don't need one. And I had this with a lot of founders that I worked with when they were starting businesses. They're like, I need a logo and a website. I'm like, no, you need to see if people are gonna buy what you have to sell. Y'all need to go out there and do that too. Are people buying you? Um, also you can put it in your email signature like, Hey, I'm buying a business. If you know anyone, please talk to me. Like just these little things make such a big impact. And better—know your audience, right? Business cards. Brokers are boomers, sellers are boomers. They like business cards. They like handshakes. So you should get out there and network with them and communicate with them in the way that they like. Business cards—they love it. I was going to these events trying to meet business owners and they're like, do you have a card? I'm like, what? Why? So I get it. Millennials and Gen Z, like, we don't do business cards. So I've got the Millennials and the Gen Z taken care of on the back. They can scan the QR code. They don't have to take my card, but before you do a website, I would do business cards. Quite honestly.

Okay, I'm not gonna go through each one of these in detail, but like I'll explain the concept behind the two. When you're putting a buyer profile together, you wanna put together your acquisition criteria. Importantly, like how are you gonna finance this thing, right? Get pre-qualified. I'm pre-qualified for this amount. Cool, that covers it off right there. Then what are your goals with business ownership? The business characteristics that you want, what kind of owner transition that you're looking for, and what industries you're interested in. Buyer profile is you, right? What's your career history? The key attributes that are gonna make you a great owner and your values and vision. So you really wanna have both of those. And we do that for all of our clients. We put this together onto a profile that we then send along every time we engage on behalf of our client. So really what you're trying to do is: what is the financial capability of this person? What are they looking to buy and why? And will they be a good owner of this business? Do I believe that they will have what it takes to get it done? And communicate that in your buyer profile.

Just some quick tips 'cause I'm conscious of time. I wanna leave time for questions. Canva is literally the best $10 a month business investment I have ever made. Guess where this presentation was made. Guess where these business cards were made? I am not a graphic designer, but Canva makes stuff look so much better. Um, so like you can make your buyer profile on that. You can do business cards, you can do just about everything there. Um, it's an amazing investment. Also, um, 10th grade language. Jargon is not your friend. Um, so again, people feel like, oh, I need to demonstrate that I have all this experience and credibility and I know what I'm talking about. If, especially if you come from like tech or corporate and you're looking at getting into like blue collar businesses, jargon is not your friend. So if you need to, run that stuff through GPT on your buyer profile. We intentionally take all those jargony words out, like change management and blah blah blah—like all this jargon that comes up in corporate world—and like make it real, so a 10th grader can understand it. Um, and lastly, you know, Will pointed this out. You're gonna be Googled. What are they gonna find right when they go to your Facebook or when they go to your Instagram or when they go to your LinkedIn, what are they gonna find out about you? And is there consistency with the brand that you're putting out there as a buyer?

Okay, um, super quick. Not a pitch on me, but some of you are probably like, what do you do? Um, we help first time buyers find and buy businesses. You might wanna do this if you wanna keep your W2, if you want that credibility, geographic constraints, uh, you don't wanna do this by yourself. We've got an amazing team that go out and search for you and help you get a deal over the line. We spend a whole bunch of time understanding you and creating your profile. Um, we've been doing the numbers and we actually save our clients 30 to 45 hours a month, right? You only have 30 days a month. So we're actually increasing the amount of time that is spent on your search. So that was a cool stat that came up. Um, and I heard this from Dylan, the founder of Baton, which is a great, uh, new tech platform for brokering. Um, and they did a study and they said, you know, only 2% of people that say they wanna buy a business actually do. So there's a whole bunch of intention out there, not a lot of follow through. So we exist to help the 2%. Um, reminder October 9th, uh, we've got the part two of this webinar. So if you enjoyed this and you wanna hear on how to build relationships that are gonna help you win over those sellers and brokers through the way that you interact with them, please come along to that. Um, that QR code takes you to our website. And now I would love to answer any questions that came up. Um, and that was so much fun. I'm so excited. Uh, I got to share that. So thank you for your time. I know it is limited.

Will Smith (Host): Wow, Athena, that was epic. That was, that was also a first that I received an email during the webinar from somebody in the audience saying, Hey, I'm in the webinar right now. This is awesome. Really, really great energy. Of course, Athena.

Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): Oh, that's kind. Thank you.

Will Smith (Host): And, um, and just totally practicing what you preach. You, you eat your own dog food, you are pattern interrupt. You care a lot about brand. You, you do all—everything that you just taught us, uh, you are the picture of. So it's, it's very powerful. Um, yeah, I, I mean I ha—I was just, uh, just the stuff about brand I, I just love. Um, but just a couple things if I could that landed with me that I thought were great points. The attraction/repulsion thing. You know, attract people, repel people. Your McGuireWoods experience where you attracted people that were into your, your vibe and not those who weren't. It's just—if you don't know anything about brand, if you don't know anything about kind of putting yourself out there into the public, everyone's first reflex is to be liked by everyone. You don't want to turn off anybody. But you know, once you know something about branding, you realize that, that if you're everything to everybody, you're nothing to no one. So you have to eventually stand for something. Um, otherwise you will just be lost in the sea of, of nondescript. Um, so in some ways you just have to embrace the fact that, that if you're gonna do this well, you're gonna invariably maybe repel some people, um, which is okay. And you want that, that's—that's an indicator you're doing something right. You know, you shouldn't be for everybody. You're not gonna enjoy working with everyone. Um, and, and yeah, like, I, I think it's okay, but we, we obviously have trauma around being liked and there's survival and that and that sort of thing, but it's an indication that you're onto something good if, if like, some people are like, I don't like that. I don't think everybody's gonna like my flavor. It's too much for some people. Like, that's good. I'm, I'm cool with that.

And I just love how you—the looking for signals of things. So no one's gonna—it's like, what to be looking for? 'Cause no one of course tells you, Hey, you're doing this right and doing that right. You're looking for these indirect signals. So encourage people to review all the signals that you had at the bottom of the—all those relevant slides. That was awesome. Um, I could go on, but I don't wanna steal from the audience's questions. Um, so let's get into those. Um, we knew we'd get this question. You already touched on it. Should you have a website? Expand on your thoughts there, please.

Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): Yeah. So, um, like I said, you are selling something, right? You're selling yourself in this and building a website before you know what your pitch is and how you get people to convert. Um—oh, did I lose you there? Okay, good. Um, I see it as a false product. Like you feel productive by building a website, but it's not actually doing the thing that will get you the outcome that you want, which is to be a business owner. If you want the outcome, then you should be putting yourself out there, having more conversations, seeing if you can get through the brokerage to the owner. This is the first thing that we have clients do when they work with us. It's like, regardless of whether you—like, okay, you might not love the deal, but I need you to also practice how to get through the gatekeeper. So if you're building a website before you've had those conversations, and you know what unlocks access to the ultimate prize. Building a website is just—it makes you feel productive, but it's not actually doing something. Also, you probably, when you build it, aren't gonna have the SEO capabilities to make sure that when they Google your name, it's you that's coming up. If you genuinely feel like it would help you, or you can do it very quickly and it won't distract from the overall outcome, sure. But make sure you're making it authentic to you. You're telling your story, you're speaking to your hero as to like what you're gonna do for them, right? All of these concepts should be portrayed in the website, but I honestly don't think you need it. I really don't. You create a really great PDF buyer profile that you can send along, that's more than enough. And remember your audience—that like most of 'em don't, uh, you know—even getting 'em on Zoom, sometimes they don't do it. They, they jump on the phone or whatever. So you wanna make sure that you're communicating to your audience. Um, yeah, I think a good PDF buyer profile is more than enough.

Will Smith (Host): Great. Thanks, Athena. You still—you still got me?

Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): Sorry, my—um—

Will Smith (Host): I do, yeah, I'm still here. Okay, great. Um, okay. About, uh, AcquiMatch, do you only help first time buyers?

Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): Yes, as of right now, because we have a methodology for how we take people through things. So if you are like an experienced—uh, actually I, there's a caveat. I have a client who bought a business seven years ago, and the playing field was very different back then than what it is now. And they're like, I have no idea. Like, it's a totally different like, landscape, so I need help. So in those situations where people are okay, uh, going through our methodology of getting you to become the right buyer, then that's good. But if you're like, I'm experienced, I just wanna buy this type of business, we'll refer you out to great partners that can help you do that.

Will Smith (Host): Uh, how do you suggest to build a visible buyer profile if you still have a day job. There's a couple of variations on this question, but the point is that they don't want their—I guess that they don't want their current employer or their boss to know that they're out there looking for a business to buy to then quit.

Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): Yeah. Okay. So, um, we actually—a lot of our clients come to us for that reason, right? So we're able to anonymize people and, and add that credibility without completely putting them out there. Um, I'm gonna pull up one of our buyer profiles real quick to show how I did this, if that's okay.

Will Smith (Host): Mm-hmm.

Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): Um, this is just—uh, actually, let me make sure I've got it in the—I still got my slides up. This is a, like John Doe and it's not, um, it's not an actual person, but, um, you can create a profile that you send along to people, um, you know, when you're engaging with them, but you're gonna have to be you when you go to these brokers. So if you're like, I need to stay undercover, then building a website's kind of—per that, that's why I like the buyer profile PDF that you send along, 'cause you're gonna have to engage with them. Um, but when we do this for clients, we don't put last name. We don't put identifying information about them. So we'll talk about, um, you know, their experience, the kinds of businesses that they worked at, but we won't say specifically the company name. We won't say their last name. Um, and then when we reach out, you know, we're, we're talking about this person—eventually you're gonna have to come out to this person. Um, but this is all basically anonymized and it gives a ton of the information that you're gonna need, the acquisition criteria, this person's personal goals, business characteristics that they're looking for, owner transition. And then on the right is the profile, right? Like, tell me about you, your story, your career history, what your key attributes are, your values and vision. None of this says who this person is. Um, but you can still tell a story without doing that. Um, industries of interest and then the fact that they've been pre-qualified, et cetera. Those are the main key things. But, um, I would say—at some point you're gonna have to tell people, right? So then I, then I would have a deeper conversation with yourself of like, are you really gonna do this? You know, if you're scared to put it out there that this is something that you want to do, um, you're gonna have to when you go through the diligence process, right? Like, it's, it's gonna be tough. So you can keep it secret, but it's gonna be really difficult to do if you're doing it on your own. Um, and I don't think you need a public persona necessarily, uh, if you're engaging a lot directly with like brokers and, and, you know, engaging with listings and stuff like that.

Will Smith (Host): Great. Um, Damien wants to know how Athena overlaid herself over the slides.

Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): Isn't it such a cool feature. Okay. Other fun feature on LinkedIn—or on Zoom—that people don't realize is you can put a video up, uh, when people are sitting in your waiting room on Zoom. So my poor team, like they all have this in their waiting room, and it's me being like, hi, welcome to AcquiMatch. Here's what we do. Um, but like branding, right? Uh, when you hit Share, there's some options and it will show you on the right hand side that you can like, do a person overlay over the slides. Um, but that was a—it's a branding thing for me, right? I know I'm very animated as a person and that helps me when I do these presentations. So it's an intentional choice to overlay myself over those slides too.

Will Smith (Host): Great. Uh, my wife and I have already purchased one business that we're currently operating and are actively engaging with several others to add to our family long-term HoldCo. Love it. I wanna build a website promoting that we are actively looking for businesses to buy. So they do wanna do a website, but wanna display the businesses that we do not want and give ideas of the businesses that we would like to look at. Um, I think—says the questioner—I think this transparency will be refreshing. Does this come from a negative place in terms of branding to say, I don't want—Is that putting negativity out there and does that tarnish the brand? Should everything just be positive, you know, sort of affirmative?

Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): No, I—I think it's like, okay, so when I—I have this like, fun presentation where I actually teach branding as a concept and stuff. And the strongest brands in the world know who they aren't. They know who they're not for. They say no to things, right? But it's, it's all in how you position it. Um, I'm pretty sure even on our website on the buyer page, it's like, who we're not for, right? Um, so it's okay to do that and it helps people like to self-identify and like, it's, it's part of that magnetism thing. It's like, here's what's important to us. Here's what is a good fit, here's what's not a good fit. Um, so just like saying—rather than like, we don't want it or whatever—you can, you can make the language so like, Hey, uh, so we're not open to everything or everything's not gonna be a great fit for us. Here's what's not a good fit. And absolutely, and I think you should do that and say what you're not interested in. Actually, interestingly, when we go through, um, our process, we have clients go through this really exhaustive like, um, business characteristics questionnaire and spend a lot of time on industries. And we don't have them choose what they want. We have them choose what they don't want. Because like when people are industry agnostic, it's like, I need to know what your nos are. 'Cause I don't want that—the big old team that I put the slide up—I don't want them spending time on deals that if I put it right in front of you, you're gonna be like, oh no, I'd never do that, right? So like the hard nos are more important really than the maybes because it's like, well, maybe I'd be open to that. Okay, cool, we can work with that. But I had a client, um, who—like their family had a septic business and he's like, Nope, never again, nothing in waste. Don't ever put anything in front of me that has waste. And I was like, cool, that's great, you know? So, um, I think you can actually be a lot more effective knowing what your nos are than what your maybes are.

Will Smith (Host): Great. Uh, can you say something about, uh, your fees and how you guys get paid, what your cost—and where you're based?

Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): Yeah. So we help clients all over the US. We only work with US clients because we spend a lot of time helping you with the structuring, um, and the financing, uh, side of things also. Um, so we do a, uh, flat fee depending on your search, and you'll pay the majority of that upfront. That's your skin in the game. It gives you credibility with the lenders. Um, and then there's a small fee that, uh, we will get when you close. Um, we had to structure it differently to make sure we're SBA compliant. So fun fact about our fees is you can apply all of them to the equity injection when you close on the business, provided you work with a lender that understands, uh, us and, and how we add value. Um, but you're essentially prepaying your down payment with us. Um, and everyone depending on the search that we're doing with you gets the same fee. So we don't do percentage based fees because I think that then incentivizes me badly and incentivizes my team badly. Um, so everyone will get the same focus rather than like, oh, this person's going after a bigger deal, and I'll get a percentage of that. Those aren't SBA compliant either. So, um, long story short, the way that you can decide whether you wanna have a chat with us is we'd like to see people have at least 200,000, um, available to invest in a business. Um, and then that won't break the debt service coverage ratio with our fee. Um, and Austin on our team can have a conversation with you and kind of find out more about your search. Um, we're a white glove concierge service, so it's a, uh, a service that we're providing to you. So we need to find a little bit more about what you're trying to do before I can give you that price. But if you've got at least 200 available to invest, then the fees will be fine with you looking at businesses.

Will Smith (Host): Great. And if—I'll just underline something you said there, Athena, about your fee being flat. It doesn't vary from deal size to deal size or person to person. That is a little bit uncommon in M&A land where maybe other buy sided brokers have a model where they—it's like, could be like a Lehman structure or something where they, um, are earning a percentage based on deal size, and so there's gonna be some incentive for them to bring you a bigger deal and/or work for the clients that are shopping the biggest deals.

Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): Yeah. And most of the percentage—but like, if you work with a percentage based firm, you're probably not gonna be able to use SBA money to pay that. You're gonna have to pay it in addition to what you're doing, uh, equity injection-wise through your deal. So, um, we protect your buying power, essentially, which is pretty cool.

Will Smith (Host): Yeah, that's very powerful. Um, yeah, everybody—so people asking about the fees—so, you know, you heard Athena. Get in touch. Um, okay, uh, let's see, couple more here. How would you advise a young woman without a finance or MBA background to position herself as a serious buyer in a search fund process? What strengths or experiences tend to differentiate women or non-traditional backgrounds—I guess non-finance backgrounds—when competing with the typical male MBA crowd? Great question.

Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): I love this question so much. 'Cause here's—here's a pattern-interrupt answer, right? Um, women, we have such an advantage, such an advantage in this space because we're already a pattern interrupt. And I can tell you wholeheartedly that all of these wonderful men that are in the ETA and finance community want to support women. So in effect, you are already a pattern interrupt at an advantage being a woman. Um, and I'm gonna get into some general—like, so a lot of what I am interested in is psychology, how we're wired, survival, et cetera. Um, there's some really great, uh, work by Barbara Huson. Um, she wrote a book called Rewire for Wealth, but essentially like women are wired to protect our resources, right? Like we gotta protect our family. And back in the days when men had to go out and hunt, we had to make sure we were protecting the camp. So men are actually wired to take risk because that's how they survived, that's how they passed on their DNA. Women are wired to protect. So investment, finance, that sort of thing is a natural—like that—that's why I think we don't see a lot of women in the finance space, um, is because it's, it's just not a natural thing. It's very unnatural for us to be like, let me put everything on the line, you know? Um, but that being said, men are very competitive. They're wired to be competitive, whether they actually are in effect or not, but their wiring is to be competitive with other men and to protect and help women, right? So when we know this, and it's not like, oh, I'm being looked down upon because I'm a woman, actually, it's an advantage because I'm not seen as a threat to men by like walking around. They're like, Hey, cool, what are you doing? How can I help? You know? And honestly, this is—this is what I get. And when I showed up in leopard print and rhinestone cowboy boots, you know, men were super great at interacting with me. It was women that were giving me the cold shoulder and not treating me well. And I, I think we've been conditioned to think that we are in competition with each other for limited spots. And the more that we can actually support each other and cheer each other on, um, the better. Um, Becky is doing a great job of like bringing women into this space. The SMBash guys are like always trying to get more women to the events, that sort of thing. So there's no, uh, limit on people wanting to support and back women. Actually, uh, at the Independent Sponsor Conference, for example, I got a bunch of—like, I tried to request meetings with a bunch of investors who wrote to me after the fact, and they're like, I love backing women. Like, women don't take the kind of risks that men do, so they end up being very solid investments. So I say all that to say, reframe in your mind that actually what you're perceiving is your weakness is your absolute superpower. You're already a pattern interrupt, and your rarity is something that people wanna support. People want more women as business owners. They want more women to invest in. They want more women to be doing this. So using that to your advantage.

I don't have a finance background or an MBA either, you know, like, um, and impostor syndrome is real. Like I was teaching entrepreneurship at one of the top business schools in the country because I, I have battle wounds of entrepreneurship, right? Like I have, I have the experience. So what you need to dig into is what's your story? What's your qualities? What's gonna make you a good business owner? What have you experienced or done in your life that you could communicate to people? And that's what's going to attract them to you. If you feel like you don't have, um, you know, experience yet, then go out and, and collect that experience. Go shadow people in their businesses, go volunteer. Go find opportunities to give yourself that experience and those stories. So people are like, okay, I, I see what you have to give. So if you've done marketing your whole life, like use that to your advantage and be real about that. Like, what did you achieve? Um, so I hope that answers it, but like, I guess, I guess the headlines are you're in such a sweet spot, honestly, being a woman in this space. There's not enough of us here. Um, I love championing other women and shouting 'em on and, and here's that being kind thing, right? Like, if I see a woman dressed like in a cool outfit, I'm like, oh my God, I love her outfit. You know, as opposed to like, what is she wearing? Um, so we can—we can be that energy out there and supportive of each other too, and build each other up because the men are lining up to help us.

Will Smith (Host): That was awesome, Athena. Um, can I say something that you, you made me think of that, uh, is unrelated to being a woman, but it is related very much to the insecurity as a buyer. And if you feel like all these other people with finance backgrounds and MBAs are out there and you just don't have the knowledge that they do, um, I think it's fair to say that what a seller might be looking for—I'm sure if you, the more knowledge the better, of course. But what they're looking for is your ability to learn. So if you can demonstrate, um, not that you already know everything, but you're somebody that can learn quickly and, and, and cares about learning—even in your interactions with them over the course of weeks—if they can perceive a delta that you've, that you've gone from not knowing something a couple weeks ago and you're talking to them again and now you know more, um, you know, they, they don't really expect you to know everything already. Um, but if you can—but, so if you can somehow broadcast that you're somebody who can learn—that, that's what they're asking. Not does this person know HVAC? No, they're asking, can this person learn how to own this business? So however you can think about broadcasting that you are teachable, that you learned, et cetera—

Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): You get it? Okay. So I'll build on that 'cause I'll, I'll tell you exactly how to do that. Uh, Alex Hormozi defines intelligence as the rate at which you apply new knowledge—actually putting it to action. So those of you that take everything from today and you go and do something about it tomorrow, technically are more intelligent than people that get the knowledge and do nothing with it. The most addictive thing to somebody later in their career that's looking to hand over their legacy is giving someone advice and seeing them go do something with it. So one of the things that I— and we'll talk about this in part two, like how to endear yourself—and whoever the woman was that asked the question, like, please come to that. Because again, we have a distinct advantage with how we can create relationships. But having them tell you their story will endear them to you, versus being a finance bro and going in and being like, what happened to your margin in 2022 in May? Is actually something to do—like it's, it's gonna do worse for you as opposed to like, Hey, how did you survive COVID, tell me how you got through it. You know, like, what did you learn from that? Having someone tell you their story and what they learned makes them think like, this person is gonna be a great person to hand over and they're hungry for knowledge. Ask for feedback. Like I tell my clients every time you put an offer in and it doesn't get chosen, find out why. And then the brokers are like, that's great. I love that you did that. Like, I hope the next one we can do something together. You know? It—it’s addictive and, and, and it's frustrating. So, you know, the—I'm gonna talk about the "pick your brain" sessions and the asking for coffees and stuff like that—like people that are in demand and don't have a lot of time, but have a lot of knowledge. Like, it's frustrating to give someone advice and go watch them do absolutely nothing with it, you know? So people want to continue to help you when you go out and do the thing that they—they're like, go try this. And you're like, okay, I tried it. Here's what happened. Give me more.

Will Smith (Host): Yeah, yeah, absolutely. Um, everyone, there's a link again to the webinar. Um, and yeah, so—and we have it called Tactical EQ to win over sellers and brokers. Um, and that is on October 9th. So register there. Uh, Athena, we gotta let people go. Um, any last thoughts before we do?

Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): Um, no, this has been a lot of fun and, and I hope you guys are seeing that you can have fun and, and be effective in this space. You know, like we don't all have to all be dry and boring and serious and whatever, like being yourself, um, is one of the ways that you win. And it—it's one of the gifts of business ownership. I get to choose how I show up. I get to choose the people that surround me. I get to choose the customers that I have. So like, thinking about your brand and what's important to you and what's unique to you will actually set you up really well. 'Cause that's, that's kind of the gift of ownership, is you get to choose. Um, so choose something that makes you happy. Choose something that gives you energy. Choose to show up in a way that, that you know, like makes other people happy too—the right people.

Will Smith (Host): Amazing point to end on. Athena Simpson. So fun but also serious. Really, really valuable, meaty content here today. We look forward to October 9th for part two. Uh, everybody, it's Athena Simpson, it's AcquiMatch. Uh, reach out to her, her team, her website if you're interested in potentially working with them. Uh, Athena Simpson, thank you so much. So, so great. Um, this ends the webinar. See you y'all on October 9th. Bye.
