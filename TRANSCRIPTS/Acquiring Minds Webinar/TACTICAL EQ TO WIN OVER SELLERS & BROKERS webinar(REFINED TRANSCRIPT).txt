Will Smith (Acquiring Minds): Welcome everyone to this webinar on tactical EQ to win over sellers and brokers.

Will Smith (Acquiring Minds): My name is Will Smith. I'm the host of the podcast Acquiring Minds.

Will Smith (Acquiring Minds): Today's speaker is Athena Simpson of AcquiMatch.

Will Smith (Acquiring Minds): You have heard Athena's name in a few Acquiring Minds episodes. She's helped a few guests on the pod buy their businesses. She was a searcher herself, so she understands what it's like, the risks, the highs, the lows. I'm gonna hand the mic over to Athena so she can introduce herself here in a second.

Will Smith (Acquiring Minds): The usual housekeeping first, we're recording. You'll get a link to the recording, uh, and the slides, uh, in the next day or so, probably actually toward the end of the day tomorrow. And if you have a question, um, put it in the Q&A. Uh, use the Q&A button here in Zoom. We have the chat turned off. We're gonna let Athena run, and then we'll do Q&A with whatever time we have left. But feel free to put those questions in as we go as Athena goes. And I think with that, Athena, please introduce yourself and take us into your presentation.

[00:01:28]
Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): Amazing. Thanks for having me again. Will, I have so much fun doing this and so much fun with you. So, uh, thank you for the opportunity as always. I'm gonna go ahead and share my screen here. I think this was a fan favorite last time, so I'll put myself in front of the slides. It is an amazing Zoom feature. Um, those of you that know me know I get a little animated, so it gives me fun times to do it. So can you see my slides? Okay. Amazing. Uh, so welcome.

Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): Let's talk about tactical EQ. Um, my name is Athena Simpson. I'm the founder of AcquiMatch. Um, I also call myself an acquisition matchmaker. So we basically help first time buyers, uh, become owners one match at a time. There's gonna be a lot of dating analogies, but think of what you're doing out there, scrolling and, uh, matchmaking.

Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): So, um, a little about me before we get started. I am a five time founder. Some successes, lots of failures, got the battle wounds, um, and 25 years’ experience building, scaling and advising businesses. I've helped thousands of businesses, uh, founders, future entrepreneurs, start, scale and raise capital. And I've advised Fortune 500, FTSE 100 investors, government clients, all over the globe, uh, across operations, innovation and investment. Um, and I taught entrepreneurship here in Texas at the McCombs School of Business. It's something that's very close to my heart.

Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): Uh, so much so that I am a very active member of the ETA community. I think entrepreneurship is one of the greatest things that you can do in life. Um, and buying a business where somebody has figured out product market fit and how to get their customers is even better having been in startup land. Um, and I am a former fellow searcher, as Will mentioned.

Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): So, um, I actually lost my perfect business that I was like so made to be the owner of, um, because I didn't know how to play the game. Even after raising $3 million in five days to prove to the banker and the broker that I could do it, um, I got outbid and I didn't know how to structure on a deal of that size. Um, and so that led me to my passion, which is helping other amazing people that would be great business owners, avoid that, right?

Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): So when you're looking to buy a business, you're learning two skill sets, entrepreneurship and searching for a business. So AcquiMatch, we started it two years ago to help first time buyers through this process of finding, winning, and closing on their perfect business. Um, and so today, I've always wanted to say this, I'm a big Hormozi fan. Uh, I have nothing to sell you. Um, right now our client load is completely full. We're not taking on any new clients for the foreseeable future. So I'm just here to help.

Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): Um, and there's a lot of stuff in here. I was telling Will, right before we, we went live, I could speak for hours and hours on this. Um, so I've tried to distill it down, uh, for you. There will be a cheat sheet going out with the replay. Um, there's a lot of information that I'm gonna be going through. So Will had a great idea of doing a cheat sheet checklist kind of thing. Um, so just know that's gonna be coming with the replay as well.

Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): Um, and also this is kind of a part two. So, um, if you weren't on part one that we did about a month ago, building your brand, I highly recommend going back and watching it. It's okay if you didn't watch it for today. Um, but it is very complimentary about thinking how you're showing up in the world, and then when you're actually engaging with that EQ in your brand. So that's a QR code to the replay if you wanna check that out, if you weren't on part one.

Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): Um, so today what we're gonna cover is, uh, tactical EQ for brokers and sellers. I'm gonna start out with a reality check. Uh, this is something I do often, um, to just help you understand the landscape and where you're at. Um, and then we're gonna go through a quick recap of the brand stuff that will be relevant here. We're gonna talk through broker relationships, seller mindset, relationship strategy, and moving from transactional to relational.

Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): So let's start with a reality check. Um, this is me and my team at the Texas Association of Business Brokers event a couple weeks ago. Um, we got Cash on the left with the mustache, Caris and Luke. These are our analysts here at AcquiMatch. And their job is to go out, speak to brokers, speak to owners, vet those businesses, do an analysis of 'em, and put 'em in front of our clients and help our clients to have those winning conversations, to get a shot at making an offer there. So we all went to one of the largest broker conventions in the country. Um, Texas Association of Business Brokers, there were 200 folks there.

Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): Um, and it's a really sobering experience when you go and actually surround yourself with the broker community. Um, most—there's a big barrier to entry when it comes to being a broker because you have to work for 12 to 24 months without a payment. Um, so it tends to be a lot of folks that are upper Gen X or, uh, baby boomer generation that are the business brokers. These are the folks that you're dealing with and they have decades of experience selling businesses. Most of that experience was not when the internet caught wind of buying a business. So now all of a sudden they're having to deal with a very different buyer landscape where there used to be six inquiries on a listing. Now there's like 200 of 'em within the first hour.

Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): And their perception is that most of the folks out there are wasting their time. They don't have any money. They don't have what it takes. So I'm gonna take you through some of the things that we heard a lot of—we hear a lot of, you know, between my team and me, we've done hundreds, if not maybe thousands of broker calls at this point. Um, so I wanted to share that insight.

Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): And, and the first one really important for you all to understand, even though we think it's cool to be a searcher, the brokers do not, right? It's a dirty word. They translate it into tire kickers. So if you're on the phone with a broker, do not call yourself a searcher. Um, they don't like it.

Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): Uh, the perceptions of first time buyers—we went through this a lot in, in part one of building your brand—but they're not great, right? Especially if you found this out from the internet and you're looking at businesses, you know, maybe industry agnostic. They just think you're gonna be a headache. You don't have money, you're not gonna be able to get it done. They don't trust you, they don't like you. You're not asking the right questions, you're not following the process, basically. It's not great, 'cause there's a lot of people out there that are messing it up for those of us that wanna learn the right way and do this the right way.

Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): So this is hard for most people when they start this because we're like, well, I'm a customer. I'm trying to buy something. You should service me accordingly. No. Um, know your place. There's 200 of you on every listing and probably at least 30 that are really highly qualified buyers. Um, so you're one of many that could buy this business. Um, and if you're not showing up in the right way and you don't have the right experience and, and you're not giving them confidence, you're not gonna be one of those, you know, 30 that they've considered qualified.

Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): Um, they're also not gonna chase you. You're gonna have to chase them, right? Like they are the ones that are in demand, not you. So it's a seller's market right now. And when you understand your place, you're gonna operate differently. It's competitive, and you should play it as such.

Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): Also understand that you are being vetted at every single stage, every single conversation and interaction. You are being vetted even though you think you're the one vetting the business. So when you understand that, you're gonna act differently, right? Because this whole thing is one big interview, it's one big courtship. So just remember that you are being vetted throughout this.

Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): I use this analogy a lot to help people understand kind of where they're at. But, you know, buying a business, it's like the world's largest business buying poker tournament. Um, and there are a lot of people that know what they're doing that have gotten to the final table at the World Series, like multiple times, right? And here you are a first timer showing up at the World Series and you're like, I'm gonna get to the final table and win. Um, but you haven't played the game before. You don't know the strategies. You don't know like what the statistics are in terms of the cards or how to play people. So you're up against people that have done this. Strategic investors, people that have, you know, funding behind them, private equity, um, people who have bought businesses before, other business owners or people like me and my team, right? We are your competition if you are not a client of ours. And then here you are a first timer trying to play something that is incredibly high stakes.

Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): Um, the brokers aren't happy, they're getting p****d off, right? You're showing up and you haven't even read the SIM or you're making them think that you're just wasting their time and, you know, inquiring on a whole bunch of businesses that you have no business actually being the owner of. So, you know, I use this line a lot. You might be the right owner of a business, but you're gonna lose this game if you're not the right buyer.

Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): So everything that I kind of talk about out there is to help you become the right buyer because it's, it's happened to me. I've seen it happen to friends and a lot of you folks out there, you probably would be amazing at running that business that you get really excited about. But if you're not playing the game in the right way, you're not gonna become the owner of that business.

Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): Um, there's a QR code again. I'm gonna do a quick, uh, on the replay from, from part one. I'm gonna do a quick recap 'cause it just helps set the stage, um, for where you're at. So when you think of winning, when you think of being chosen, what is happening right now is kind of what's happening to cars. Like, you look the same as every other searcher. You know, if you're showing up and you don't, you haven't done this before, so you want to stand out. Nobody wants to buy the car, really deep down, that looks like every other car. We wanna buy this car. We wanna buy a car that stands out, that makes us get excited, that makes us feel good, that makes us feel like this is right.

Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): So when you're thinking about yourself, it's, it's all about positioning yourself as the right buyer. And you're only gonna be the right buyer for certain people. You're not gonna be the right buyer for everybody, right? Not everybody wants a gold Corvette. I, I don't even know what car this is. I want a like metallic pink, sparkly Jeep, you know, like, that's not everybody's car. That's my dream car.

Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): Think about that with businesses, right? Like when you make a match, it's not just about does it have the right amount of money in the same place that I live? Like, what makes you the dream car for this person, right? How do you connect to that business and do people know, like, and trust you? This is kind of marketing one-on-one at every interaction that you have. Every conversation that you have is about showing that, that—getting people to know you, getting them to like you, getting them to trust you. This is with every interaction you have. So the stronger you are at this of building the relationship, the better this process will go and the more that they'll feel good about you.

Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): Um, I also talked about this last time. I, I think this is one of the most groundbreaking concepts, me as a business owner, as a marketer, ever wrapped my head around. Um, so you can apply it as a business owner anytime you're marketing something or marketing yourself—the hero's journey, right?

Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): So most of us wanna position ourselves as the hero in the story, but we would get more done by positioning our target as the hero in that journey. What do I need to do to help them avoid failure or achieve success? So in this case, your seller or your broker is your hero. And what do you need to do to help guide them to that, right? And you might not have the experience or knowledge, but there's things that you can do to help them in their journey. 'Cause a broker might have been going through this with the owner for years before they even got it listed. Like they're, they're on it.

Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): So the journey, the hero's journey is, you know, for example, Cinderella had a really bad situation and her sisters and her mom were like really mean to her. And then up shows this fairy godmother that's like, Hey, so I know you're in a bad place right now. Would you like me to bibbidi-bobbidi-boo you, stick you in this pumpkin so you can like change your life for the better. And Cinderella's like, oh my God, yes. Like, put me in that pumpkin. And so she goes and, and, and changes her life as a result of that. The fairy godmother was the guide and the one that made that happen, right? We're helping our heroes or heroines get the end result that they want. So think of that with your brokers and your sellers. Like, what does success look like for them? Or how can I help them avoid failure?

Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): So when we're talking about brokers, they are your ticket to business ownership. Business ownership is the hottest club in town right now. And the brokers are the bouncers that are there to make sure that the riffraff doesn't get into the club, right? So you are the riffraff unless you figure out what the bouncer wants to see in order to get into that club. They have a very important job to do. People have hired them to keep people they don't want out of their business, out of their lives and out of those conversations, right? So think about that.

Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): Um, I don't know. I—I'm much older now. I was young in the time of electronic music not being allowed on, on the radio at the time. They didn't recognize it as a genre. So like everything was like underground and you know, you had to have a piece of paper to tell you like where to drive on the map or call up the map point and that sort of thing. And like, I always made a point of making friends with the bouncers and the club owners and the promoters because if I was friends with them and if I was nice to them, they were more likely to let me in when there was a really long line. Um, so just think about that, right? Like these are the bouncers and they have a very important job.

Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): So number one is don't be an a*****e. Like, kindness costs you nothing in life. And we've gotten to the point where we're so mean to people all the time 'cause we're so up in our own stresses. Um, but it doesn't cost you anything to be nice to people. Nothing at all. Even if somebody else is being an a*****e, right? They might have had a really horrible thing happen to them. You don't know what's going on in their world. But I will say, if you have a tendency to be mean to people all the time, business ownership is not for you. I don't care what business you buy, you're gonna end up ruining it because nobody likes working with a******s.

Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): Don't ask brokers for pick your brains or coffees, um, or anyone for that matter, right? Like, somebody's time is valuable and you are showing up like, hi, I have literally nothing to offer you. Would you like to give me an hour of your time and expertise? Um, and then on top of that, you maybe—let's say I give someone a—I stopped doing this ages ago because I realized, I was like, people wanna pick my brain and then they go off and do nothing with that information that I just gave them, right? So I gave an hour or half an hour of my valuable time and expertise that they went and did nothing with.

Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): So oftentimes pick your brains and coffees—it's like making you feel like you're being productive, but if you're not willing to put that stuff into action, like don't have a conversation with someone. The best way you can engage with brokers is find a deal that you are a good fit for and engage them on that. They are busy. They have hundreds of people reaching out to 'em. No, they do not want to have a coffee with you unless you engage with them on a deal, you're a serious qualified buyer, you—you—they like you, right? Like the tides turn when they realize, oh, this is somebody serious that I want in my buyer network. So when I have a deal, I can come to them.

Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): Um, but just please, can we just stop pick your brains and coffee chats like across the board, not just for brokers. Um, if you want someone's expertise, I, I did this a lot when I was young, right? And even now, if I want someone's time, I will be like, okay, how can I help them? Or maybe I could just offer to work for free for them. You know, I got a lot of opportunities when I was young by just being like, I'm gonna sit here and work for free and you can give me anything and you do not need to pay me anything. And they're like, well, I, I wanna help. You know? Um, think of how you can add value first,

Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): but just on that note, like, um—oh, I keep doing this. I exited out of the slides, my bad, get back into that. There's this button that's like a escape button on my remote that I always end up hitting when I get excited and it takes me outta the moment.

Will Smith (Acquiring Minds): Um, we're still with you, Athena.

Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): Great. When you, um, engage on a deal, that—that changes it for—and they'll wanna have a conversation with you, right? Like, if you're serious and, and you can have conversations and ask them questions. So like, they love it when you're like serious about a deal, a good fit for it and get in touch with them that way.

Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): Um, when you are looking at businesses, you want to connect yourself to the business. Nobody likes a player, okay? So we're gonna use a lot of dating analogies today. You can feel it when somebody's not serious. So when they're not—like they're not interested in you for the person you are and finding connections, it's just like your warm body. Same thing with businesses. Like why are you reaching out on that business? Why are you specifically interested in that business? Why are you a good fit for that business?

Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): And you wanna make that connection before you even get on the call or even inquire about the business. Because I can't tell you how many brokers I was talking to a couple weeks ago at the event and they're like, yeah, if I see somebody like inquiring on a whole bunch of listings, I won't even get back to 'em, right? So like, you need to look like you—you can be industry agnostic and still be focused.

Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): So one thing you can do is like, hey, I realize that I don't have roofing experience, but I'm a, um, real estate investor. I've overseen roofs on my house and I see that the current owner does B2C sales. I have experience in B2C sales, so I will have a, you know, knowledge gap, but I'm willing to do it. Or here's what I'm already doing to bridge that knowledge gap, right? I've connected myself to the business even though I don't have the direct industry experience.

Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): Um, and do your homework. So nothing p****s off brokers more than you not reading the SIM. Like they spent so much time—well, it depends on the broker, right? Some SIMs are like, what, what is even this one page and other SIMs, they—they went into like insane amounts of detail. And if you jump on a call with them before reading that and understanding that, or if you're asking questions that are already in the SIM, then they're thinking like, okay, if you're missing that detail, what are you gonna be like as a business owner or a buyer throughout this process, right? It wastes their time and it also positions you as somebody that is not gonna be able to do what's necessary.

Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): There's so much logistics and things that need to happen during due diligence. Uh, a stat we heard at the event was like, 50% of deals are falling apart after LOI because the diligence isn't managed correctly. Um, so they're, they're vetting you, right? If you can't even read the SIM, what are you gonna be like when it gets to diligence time?

Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): Um, this was—this was—well, communication is the key to a good relationship. We, we had fun coming up with some, some analogies, but it is very important to be responsive and communicative. Just like when you're dating someone, if you know they're taking days to get back to you, if they're messing you around, if you can kind of feel that they're like half in, half out, or maybe they're dating other people and they're not telling you, but you're like, I can tell. Um, like, just communicate, be responsive, show up.

Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): I can't tell you how far it goes that you always lob the ball back in their court, right? They respond to you and you're like getting back to 'em as soon as you possibly can. I tell my clients this, and I talk about this a lot. Corporate time and deal time are not in the same like reality at all. Deal time is like, you need to move fast, fast, fast, right? Like take up smoking and like go on a smoke break. If you're in your office, you could go out every like hour and check your email and get back to 'em. Um, it's—it's something that will indicate whether you are gonna be a good buyer and a good owner and also your interest in the deal.

Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): And to that effect, um, you wanna show them that you're serious about this. So if you show up, um, and you're—you're not positioning yourself well, you're not talking through, you know how you're looking at it. If you're not showing them why you're connected to the deal, if you're not showing them you've done your homework, you can also show up and say like, here's my resume. Here's my SBA prequalification. I have already got this deal team in place. Here's my personal financial statement. Here's everything I'm doing and things I've invested in to show that I'm serious and I've got skin in the game.

Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): You know, our clients, uh, that goes a really long way with lenders and brokers and sellers—that they've paid someone to help them through this process. Um, 'cause there's a lot of people that genuinely are tire kickers and they like the idea of buying a business more than the actual, um, reality of what it takes.

Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): Um, this is another fun one from Will: I see you, right? Like, we wanna feel seen, we wanna feel understood. Brokers have one of the most wild jobs ever. I mean, we—we were asking war stories at this event and, and Cash talked to a guy that had, uh, I can't remember which side, but like buyer and seller and someone stabbed each other, right? Like, they go through some wild stuff when they are a broker. Maybe not to that extent, but you know, now they have to sift through hundreds of people.

Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): Um, if you talk to them about that and like, Hey, I, I know you have a really tough job. Like, I understand you. I know there's a lot of people that are not serious, they're not qualified. I do not intend on being one of those people. Um, you know, and, and they appreciate that. And I always—I always joke and I laugh, you know, like this is part of the EQ thing. You can be a human and have a real relationship and like, Hey, uh, wow, the internet really likes business buying right now. Like, that must be tough for you. And they're like, yeah, you know, and you're automatically like breaking down those walls and, and you see them in that and people that feel understood, like you better.

Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): Um, on—on my very big deal that I was one of 14 offers on, um, the broker—every, almost every night during that deal, I would be on the other end of the phone listening to the broker tell me all his grievances with all the horrible buyers out there. Like it was a lot of my time listening to how horrible all this stuff was. But he liked me because I did that for him and I was kind of his confidant through it. And guess what? I was the only one out of 14 buyers that was allowed to meet the sellers in person, right? Like being a human and treating people well and making them feel understood is—is—it can go a long way.

Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): On top of that, like ghosting someone—ghosting a broker when they've done work to, you know, get you an NDA signed, get you a SIM, maybe have a call with you, maybe even introduce you to the seller. Do not ghost them. Like everybody here I think understands a sales process, right? Like, if you have somebody that engaged you and took your time and they just ghost you, you're like, well cool, I'm not talking to you again.

Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): Um, if you're not a fit, let them know early and let them know why. You know, so like, hey, I really appreciate your time and effort, but I'm not the right buyer and here's why. But I would love to engage with you on future ones. I really liked working with you. I appreciate all the work you put in. This goes so far with them because most people think it's transactional. They're just like, I got a SIM, I had a call. I don't need to let this person know I'm no longer interested. Like, why are y'all doing that? That's not cool.

Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): Caris from my team—she's former, um, sell-side. She actually sold her parents' business in university. That's how she got into the industry. It's pretty cool. Um, so she was doing a lot of recon with these brokers and kind of seeing what was going on with them and from her own experience. Like remember that somebody's paycheck is dependent on one person making it through the finish line. And they will have done sometimes a year, two years of work, maybe even longer to get the seller there. And you need to show them that you're worth the risk—worth them betting their six figure paycheck on.

Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): And then on top of that Will rightly pointed out, there's only so many introductions that a broker can make to a seller without exhausting them and/or making them like, you know, look incompetent. So if they just introduce anyone to them, the seller's gonna get run down. Or, I mean, I heard a lot of stories this last—at the—at the event of losing listings over introducing the wrong buyer, you know, or a buyer that did some wild stuff on the call or didn't know protocol or, you know, didn't seem serious. And the sellers were like, what are you even doing? Why have I engaged you? Right?

Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): So are you worth the risk and an introduction? Think about that, right? Like, if your multi six figure paycheck was reliant on somebody that you were talking to, how would you be scrutinizing them and vetting them? And are you gonna treat them differently now as a result of that—understanding the risk they are taking by introducing you and putting you through the process.

Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): So you gotta also remember the broker wants the deal to close too. So treat your broker well, show them you're serious and you can close and you can turn them from a gatekeeper into a champion. I can't tell you how many of my clients have brokers that are like strategizing with them to try to figure out how to get a winning deal and get it over the line. And once you're in LOI, once you've signed the LOI, the broker works for you. The paycheck comes from your payment, right? So even though they do represent the seller, you are the one that's going to help them get paid. They want the deal to close. That's why they're there. They're an intermediary helping the deal get over the line. So they're not an adversary, they're just doing their job of making sure that the riffraff doesn't get through and that they're choosing the right person to actually get it over the finish line.

Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): So, um, this is a fun dating story, but, um, I had this girlfriend when I was single and like she would always get asked on a, you know, second date—guys were just always enamored with her. And I was, you know, women talk a lot when they're single and they're dating and it's like, what are you doing? And she's like, well, I just always make sure when I go on a date with someone that I make sure they have a great time. You know, I ask them a ton of questions, I laugh, I'm engaging, I'm like open in terms of energy. And so it always puts the ball in my court because they always want a second date because I showed up in a way that made them feel good and made them have a good time.

Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): But then she got to be the one choosing. So I, I was, you know, most of us when we were dating, or at least me when I was single, I was going on a date and I was like, what's wrong with you? Show me all your red flags right now. I don't trust you. Like, and you can feel that energy on the other side. So like, we've heard all the horror stories of deals going wrong or bad brokers and you're probably getting on the call like, what am I not figuring out? What—how are you gonna screw me over? What's the seller doing that's—I'm trusting? So like, you know, that energy doesn't feel good and it's not something you wanna engage with.

Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): And when I started flipping, I was like, okay, rather than looking for what I don't like in someone or trying to spot the red flags, let me flip to let me look for what I like, you know, and let me have fun. Like I was a standup comedian. I love laughing and joking and that sort of thing. Like let me show them that side of me. And, and sure enough, you know, like I got different results, uh, from that. I'm now happily in a, you know, home in a relationship. Um, but it was a very painful experience for me. And I think that very much applies to building relationships in general. So when you're engaging with that broker, if you show up in a way that gives them a good experience of you, they're gonna want to move you to the next stage.

Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): We just had a—a newer client get on a broker call. Broker was like, there's a process. You're not gonna meet the seller, dah dah, dah, dah, dah. And he showed up so prepared and like knew his strategy was to win him over. And by the end of it, the broker was like, okay, so I'd like you to come do a two hour in-person meeting with the seller, literally in the same call, right? So this stuff works.

Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): Um, this is one of the wordy slides. So take a snapshot of this one and it will be in the, um, checklist as well. But you're not—not on that first call with the broker just to understand the business. You wanna understand how the broker works and this can go very far with them. 'Cause they all have a different process. So, um, do they prefer you to text, call, or email? How would they like you to interact with the seller after you've been introduced? Some are hands off, some are like, don't ever speak to them without speaking to me first, right? If you ask them this stuff, then it shows like how much you, um, care about keeping the relationship with the broker good. Rather than being like, let me get you out of the way so I can get into the nightclub, you know?

Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): Um, and this bonus question here at the bottom: is there anything I should have asked you that I haven't already? This hands down has gotten me more intel on businesses than any other question I've ever asked because they're just answering your questions. So they assume you've read the SIM or they assume you have all the information. So at the end of it I'll be like, Hey, is there anything I should have asked you that I haven't already? And they'll divulge all sorts of stuff. Like, oh, there's, you know, a lawsuit happening right now, or, oh, you should know about this thing over here. And it's like, oh my God. Like, of course. Um, so that—that, if you take nothing else away from this talk, start asking that question. You can do it in interviews, you can do it in all sorts of places, but it's—it's brilliant and they like it and it makes 'em think. Um, and it also makes 'em feel like you're asking them for advice. So it's good.

Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): Okay, quickly—seller mindset. So we're shifting tack now. And you have different tactics with your brokers and with your sellers. Picture where your seller's at through this process. They're not selling a business, they're ending a relationship. This is like getting a divorce, right? It's one of the most painful things they'll probably go through and it's fraught with a lot of emotions. So imagine what your seller is going through. It's endings—endings of relationships with customers and their team. They have to have a bunch of secrecy. They—they might even be hiding this from their spouse, which feels out of integrity for them. They're under intense scrutiny like they've never experienced before when they thought they built something wonderful and it's being picked apart and their whole identity is coming into question. For many of these folks, they've only known this business and this work, so who are they after this process, right? And then there's the valuation of their life's work, which, you know, to them it's like, this might be their only retirement plan. This might be their 401k, and they're being told that it's not worth what they thought it was gonna be. This is a really emotional thing, and for those of you that have been through divorce or have had friends that have gone through it, you know, it's—it's—it's awful, right? And it's kind of similar.

Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): So what I help—I—I like using dating analogies when you're dealing with a seller to kind of think of where you're at in the relationship and what you should be doing at different stages of the relationship. And I'll caveat this by saying, um, you know, oftentimes you might be gate kept, um, from the broker, you won't be able to do these sorts of things. We do off market deals with clients too, so you get a little bit more time depending on where the relationship came from. So obviously mix and match and take what you can from it. But just always be thinking about like, how well do I know this person? Where am I at in a relationship?

Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): So buying a business is like dating with the goal of marriage, right? We're serious. Our intentions are serious, they're noble, we're not players. We wanna find the one. Um, so think about that as you're going through this. How might you approach that in dating, right? To build a foundation for a successful partnership.

Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): The first time you meet a seller, think of it like a coffee date. All you're trying to do on that first one is decide whether you like them enough to move into the next stage. Then you can start your courtship, right? So putting effort in to see if it's the real deal. You're behind the scenes, you're reviewing financials, you're doing research, you're starting your modeling. Really the outcome that you want from that is, can I say yes to seeing my life together with this person or with this business?

Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): Then in step three, we start getting into the real convos, asking the hard questions. How do you feel about children? What's your view on politics? All of those things that need to be got out of the way to make sure it's going to be a good partnership and you're gonna be in alignment. Um, do this in person if you can. Um, get away from the computer and go have these hard conversations in person, it goes a very long way.

Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): And then maybe we're getting to visit the house, right? Do a site visit. This is if you're allowed to. Um, and obviously, you know, there—there might be like, it might be after hours and that sort of thing, but really you wanna see, can I see myself living here? And I can't tell you how many times I was looking at a business online and then I'd go and visit the business and I was like, oh no, this is not for me. Right? Um, so it boggles my mind how many people go through this business buying process without visiting what they're gonna buy, like, until so late in the process. Like you could feel so much from like, is this—is this my vibe? Um, obviously you might not be let into the house until you're engaged. You know, a lot of brokers might keep you from this, so depending on where you're at. But like, please go do a house visit as soon as you can before—before you actually get married.

Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): Um, and then there might be some sneaky stalking or in my case, uh, my boyfriend did a background check on me, which I loved because it showed he was really excited about me and he wanted to make sure there wasn't anything he was missing, right? Um, we do that. We go look at somebody's social media profiles, we scroll all the way to the end and see like, who did they date, what have they done, what am I missing? So you can do this with the businesses too. You can secret shop or you know, just do your research, but make sure you do not break NDA confidentiality. Don't notify anyone of anything. 'Cause this could get you into real trouble here. But like, see what the experience is like as a customer. Are they who they say they are? Is that something that you see your alignment with?

Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): Um, and then before you make the proposal, consult your circle, um, and your deal team and your family, um, and check in time. All right? I'm gonna whistle stop through this. So you really wanna check with people before you make this decision and make sure you're not gonna ruin your life and get the right people around you, or if your life is gonna significantly change, have that conversation with your people, spouse, family, et cetera. If it's gonna change, because this can often end up breaking a deal is that you haven't actually pictured what it's gonna be like.

Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): And then the last step is proposing. So that's sending your LOI. And it's not the last obviously, but we're getting to proposal, we're getting to LOI. I say all of this because you don't wanna talk about moving to get in together on the first date. I'm sorry this thing keeps popping up and I don't—it's showing now.

Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): Um, if you get on that first coffee date call and you start asking them why they had a 2% drop in their margin in 2022, like it's too much early on, right? If you have the time, like, just think about this relationship and if I was trying to marry this person, where would I be at? Show them you're worth the compromise. Like if you're starting to throw out seller notes before they even know who you are, why would they bet their retirement on you? And play the long game, right? Think about this like a marriage and not a one night stand.

Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): You wanna move from transactional to relational and—and doing this, this mindset of how am I treating this relationally rather than transactionally will change so much for you. So the first thing is trusting. You'll see things and you're wanting to catch things that are wrong, but like, don't make assumptions. Don't be that person that doesn't trust someone. Like you wanna verify. But I always trust someone until they give me a reason not to. And then you're dead to me, right? But I, I like having an open heart and just assuming that most people, 99% of people want to do the right thing and are good people,

Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): you can also show them that you care, right? Ask them about their story, what's coming next for them. Actually listen, remember the details that they share. My favorite thing to do with sellers is, you know, they know they're getting on the phone with me to talk about selling their business, but I'm like, hey, okay, before we get into that, like tell me the origin story. How did this all happen? I love hearing it. They love sharing it. And these are people that like, have so much experience and like wild stories. Like I care. I care about their story, I care about them. Um, show them that and go meet them, please for the love of God. Go meet them in person. Go have human interaction. Don't hide behind an email thread or your LOIs. Like this is when things shift and you really build that rapport.

Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): So if you're negotiating with them, negotiate in person, it's much more collaborative when you're like, okay, hey, let's sit down and have some hard conversations, right? If you're behind your laptop or behind your deal team, things are gonna like be taken outta context. It's not gonna go well. You're probably not gonna collaborate. So this is really important to have these conversations in person when you can, you can connect with them and it's far more effective to do it this way.

Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): Um, and if the—like, okay, I understand broker won't let you meet the seller. It's competitive. You gotta put an offer in—send a video cover letter, right? Do your research on the seller. Go stalk their social media page, find out what they're into and how you connect to them. Send them a video cover letter with your LOI and be like, hi, this is me. I'm super excited about your business. You like did something amazing. Here's why. That can create a connection. And when our clients have done it in these competitive situations, it ends up getting them further along because they appreciate the effort and they appreciate the connection.

Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): Um, another thing that's like something I love doing and I love hearing about is thoughtful gestures. So I have a friend, um, who bought a business at an exceptional multiple. Um, and he wasn't the highest offer, but he knew the owner liked to golf and he is like, I'm betting he is probably gonna wanna do a lot more golfing. And he bought some golf balls and he got chosen for the golf balls. Um, when I was on my big deal, I knew that the couple wanted to travel with their kids more. So I got them a travel map, you know, like doing thoughtful things. It's like, I hear you. And also, Hey, don't you wanna be traveling? I'm the person that can help you, like go off and travel. Um, I had a seller that wanted to start an alien themed business, so I got him a little alien light, uh, for his new office, you know, so these little things—it can cost you like 15, 20 bucks, but it means a lot.

Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): Um, and then the really big thing that you wanna be thinking about is help them connect to their why through you. They're really emotional. Um, this is a tough process for them. How can you be the person that is making their next dream possible and, and someone that they can see as their successor, right? And, and why they're doing this and extending why they did all of this in the first place.

Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): Um, last thing I'll say is consider a therapist. Seriously. Like this is one of the most challenging and high stakes situations you'll ever be in in your entire life. And when you're staring down the barrel of a multimillion dollar personal guarantee that could bankrupt you and lose your house and all of these things, you're gonna act weird. You're gonna do weird things that's gonna test you on another level. Um, so don't let that kill your deal. And I can't tell you how many people I've seen that have an amazing deal in front of 'em and this kills the deal. I'm a big proponent of therapy. I think it's amazing. I have a business therapist. 'Cause tell you what, as a business owner, you're gonna be tested too. And it's better to take you out with somebody than on your people or do something rash.

Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): You wanna become the right buyer. So often you don't need to be the highest bidder if you are relational over transactional and you connect with the owner and the business on a deeper level than just the numbers. So that's all I have to share. Um, we're gonna open it up for questions. Uh, I mentioned, um, we're not taking on new clients right now, but, and if you wanna check out what we do, um, or jump on the wait list, there's a QR code there. We're probably not gonna be having new client conversations until 2026. Um, but I'm happy to answer questions in the meantime. So thank you so much. That was fun.

[00:45:47]
Will Smith (Acquiring Minds): Thank you Athena. Uh, amazing presentation as always—your, your energy is positively infectious. Um, and there was just a lot, a lot of great material in there. Reminder. Well, I don't want to—so the handout that people are gonna get—Athena, maybe just say, say, uh, what that is again.

Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): Yeah. Um, so Will rightly pointed out there's a lot of information in there and when you're getting onto a call or meeting a seller, like what's the steps or things that you need to think about? So we're gonna be creating a little checklist, cheat sheet, uh, as a takeaway of, okay, I'm getting onto a broker call. What do I need to do before, you know, I'm about to have the seller meeting. What do I need to do before? Um, so it'll be, you know, just kind of a light version of that, um, of what we work through with our clients, getting them ready for those different things.

Will Smith (Acquiring Minds): Don't forget to ask, is there anything that I'm not asking—for example, would be one of the things on there.

Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): Yes. Yeah. Stuff like that. Yes.

Will Smith (Acquiring Minds): Great. No, I mean, there's just so much in there, Athena. It was great. Um, I think this—this could be a good distillation for everyone. So that will go out, um, Athena and her team is gonna get that to us, the slides and this—this recorded presentation will go out. Um, should be before the weekend. Okay. Uh, people saying thank you, people saying phenomenal, uh, phenomenal presentation here, Athena.

Will Smith (Acquiring Minds): So we got 10 minutes for some quick questions. Um, in a previous episode, you talked about the 2% who actually succeed in this journey. What separates the two from the 98?

Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): Wow. It is, yeah. So, um, I heard this from Dylan, the founder of Baton, um, which—they're doing amazing things out there, uh, in—in the industry and doing things differently. And he said that only 2% of people that say they wanna buy a business actually do. Um, I—the same thing was true when I—I—my background is running startup communities and helping a lot of people, you know, go from future-preneur to entrepreneur.

Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): Um, the idea of business ownership is—is often more attractive than the reality of it. So people want what they perceive as freedom, which it's not, right? Like you have personal guarantee, potential bankruptcy, all these people dependent on you. That's not freedom. It's flexibility. You know, I can decide if—if I wanna, you know, take myself to an appointment or not, and I don't need to ask anyone permission.

Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): It is often your resilience and your grit. Um, and—and taking action on things and pushing through the challenges that I think sets you apart. So you really deeply need to ask yourself if you are crazy enough to take on the sheer amount of responsibility it's gonna take to do a multimillion dollar loan, take on a business, have all those people trust you, the customers, the clients and everything. And—and most people that I see not move forward are the ones that realized, um, and maybe they won't say this out loud, but the responsibility and the totality of it was too much. And actually they had it pretty good in the W2 where they could, you know, get a paycheck delivered to them every week.

Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): Uh, so I think it's mindset. I think it's grit, I think it's resilience. I think it's pushing through failure. I think it's, you know, if I were to wrap it up, like, will you push through the discomfort? Are you okay in discomfort? And will you take action despite that?

Will Smith (Acquiring Minds): I think it's, um, it's tricky to answer because basically the—there's just so many hurdles through the process. It's a game of attrition. So people are, you know, are constantly falling out—would-be buyers are falling out all the way through. They might fall out right at the earliest stages when they feel like they can't even get themselves to send an LOI, or somebody might have more—more wherewithal from that and get further through into the process, but not that far. You know, everyone's got different tolerances and different appetites for this journey. And so people can go at—at attrition—I dunno what the verb for attrition is. They can drop out at many different stages. Um, but the point is, yeah, that—that it's hard and there's just gonna be roadblock after roadblock and—

Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): And that's normal, right? Like it's—it's—it's gonna be hard no matter what you do. It's gonna be challenging no matter what you do. If you're looking for an easy out and to buy a business in six months when you've never done anything like this before. Like, you're not being realistic with the challenges ahead.

Will Smith (Acquiring Minds): Yeah. And also as you go on this process, when you hit those roadblocks, like the—you can tell yourself like, oh, this is the hard part that makes this a path that the people who do succeed are rewarded for. Like, it's like the value is in the hard sadly. Uh, but that just is a—probably a good rule of thumb for life in all of business.

Will Smith (Acquiring Minds): Um, Jonathan says very timely. I have a big seller meeting in a couple hours and this has helped immensely. Not a question, just a thank you. So that's cool.

Will Smith (Acquiring Minds): Uh, you mentioned seven steps prior to issuing an LOI, but I see multiple sellers sign an LOI within days of offers coming in. Any thoughts on how to prioritize those steps in a very condensed timeframe? Good question.

Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): Yeah, great question. It's—it's absolutely gonna be situational. So when a client has a deal that they're really excited about, one of my first questions is, what's the competitive landscape right now? Right? Like, checking in with the broker or the seller, like, is this hot? Are there a lot of offers? In what stage are they at—where you know, what's going on?

Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): Some businesses have been on the market for a year and they're like, whoa, how did you even find me? Like, you know, no one's inquired about this in a long time. You know, you're the only buyer. You've got some time to do some of these things. When there's, you know, 14 offers in the mix and it's all from experienced, private equity, et cetera—um, you know, I usually check in with the broker about timelines, uh, how far along the other offers are, um, what's important to the seller. So if you don't even get a chance to speak to the seller, use the broker and ask them like, what's important to them? What's gonna be a winning offer for them? What have they not liked in the other offers so far? Um, what's your process? What do you wanna see? You know, like show up like an ace student, you know, um, that's gonna—going like ace the test.

Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): And then that video cover letter I think goes a really long way. And look, um, I, I tell my clients because it's uncomfortable to submit an LOI when you haven't met someone, but like the very—you get to do due diligence and you get to do due diligence like on the business once you've signed the LOI. You—if they haven't let you meet them, that would be weird. But usually what I—I see happens is like, you submit it, they like you and then you, you get to start having a conversation. Um, so building rapport throughout that conversation, you know, and you can be like, Hey, I know we're negotiating deals, but I saw this thing that your company did. It's so cool. Or like, Hey, you know, can you tell me a war story while we're going through this? You can be playful or relational as you're going through something hard.

Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): So you just need to play the situation and see where you're at. I think this also comes with experience too. The more of these you kind of go through, you can get a gauge on how quick do I have to move? Do I have to like, try to make a really compelling offer and then build the relationship after. I don't love when brokers do that, but I understand why they do it. So it just depends on the situation.

Will Smith (Acquiring Minds): Great. Couple more here, Athena. Um, well, there are a bunch more, but we only have time for a couple. I love this question. Um, if you're a—a glass half empty type of guy, are you really a good fit to buy a business? If so, how do you overcome analysis paralysis in looking for all the bad things?

Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): What I—I love—I've actually thought about this. Okay, here's the woo side of me. Um, 'cause I, I've had to lean on a lot of woo in my life. Um, you can change your mindset and you can change your outlook, your thoughts become your words, become your actions, become your destiny, you know, so that if you change—if you catch the thoughts and just rewire, um, there's a great book called The Big Leap, um, that is something that I always tell people to read, which is a starter of that your reality is of your own making, and depending on how much you believe in energy in the universe and all of that. Like I was just listening to, uh, E-Squared right now, and we see 3 billion pieces of information every second. You know, we're not taking all that in. So if you focus on the bad stuff, what are you gonna see? You're gonna see the bad stuff.

Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): Or we all have that friend that—they get cheated on in every single relationship. Like, that's never happened to me before because I don't assume people are gonna cheat. They do, right? Like, they start distrusting people and think that they're gonna cheat. We see those people out there that bad things always happen to 'em, and they usually think bad things are gonna happen to 'em and they don't trust. So there's a lot of great books out there on rewiring your mind, changing your mindset. Um, and if you only see the glass half full and you only see problems without thinking through solutions, yeah, I would do some work before you buy a business. 'Cause guess what? There's problems every day, even when you have a great business. And so for me, that's when I go into like, okay, there's a problem. Like, what's the solution—back against the wall brainstorm? What are all the things I can do to solve this problem right now? Um, you know, or I see the—the light in the solution.

Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): So, um, The Big Leap is a great book. I'm in the middle of E-Squared, but I really like it. Um, or just watch some videos and like rewiring your mind for a positive mindset, but it—it all starts with how you talk to yourself. So, um, you know, therapy is great too. I, I'm a big proponent of therapy in like every facet of our life. When you become a business owner, please get a therapist. Like it's gonna test you on every level, um, and bring up all this cool stuff that you get to like rewire and change. It's like, oh, I didn't know my childhood made me like very whatever in this situation that came up as a business owner.

Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): So, um, it's a good question and—and it shows me that you have a good level of, um, um, self-awareness, which is the start, right? So if you see that, hey, this is going on with me, do something about it. You can—you can absolutely change your mindset and how you look at things.

Will Smith (Acquiring Minds): That's great. Athena, can I—can I also share a couple thoughts on this one?

Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): Yes.

Will Smith (Acquiring Minds): Uh, thank you. Um, yeah, I, uh, I do—I do think that we all kind of assume and are told that you should be an opt—you know, entrepreneurs are optimists sort of. I, I feel like that's the kind of accepted wisdom. Um, I think that—that one of the things that you should ask yourself is not just am I a pessimist or optimist, but if—if you're a—if you're a pessimist, I think you also have to ask yourself how you—what, how do you behave in bad situ—in when things do happen? Negative things happen in your life. If you're a pessimist and a quitter, probably not a good combination. Yes, but you can be a pessimist, but also a really gritty, persistent person who like, when their back's up against the wall, pulls—pulls it out. So just be—and, and if you're—so, I think—and I, and frankly, I think that persist—you know, your perseverance, persistence, resilience, et cetera, that—the grit that we hear so much about—we hear about for good reason—that I think is the more important thing to ask yourself versus are you a pessimist? Are you an optimist?

Will Smith (Acquiring Minds): Point one. 0.2 is you can really turn, especially in this world, you can really turn your pessimism—a weakness—into a strength here because you've got a nose for risk. You've got—you're naturally inclined to think about and talk about risk all day. And so you can really stress test these deals, uh, better. You—you'll have a—you'll have a better, um, eye for where a deal could go bad or a business could go bad. That is a real strength as long as you're not looking for perfection. If you're looking for perfection, then stop now. But you probably already know that. Um, you're—you're in this webinar, so you're probably not that.

Will Smith (Acquiring Minds): Um, so—so I don't think it's—I don't think it disqualifies you. I think that not being a, uh, grit person—of grit would disqualify you. Um, and I think that you try to, you know, judo this into actual, uh, strength. And last point, and then I'll let you stop. Um, we interviewed—not on Acquiring Minds, but on our sister podcast, the Minds Capital podcast—an independent sponsor. This guy, a banker who did all these independent sponsor deals on the side, these incredible returns. He's done—bought five platforms, exited—for all four, he exited for over 10x MOIC. Ridiculous track record. So first question, how did you do this sponsor? And one of the big takeaways was he starts with risk. He is a very risk averse person. He looks at every deal as how can this go badly? And I think actually Warren Buffett talks about this. Don't f it up. Like, how can—can—like, so it's—uh, he—he starts with negativity and then goes from there. So I, I don't think it's necessarily the weakness you think it is, as long as you don't just never do anything because to your question, you're—you're—you're paralyzed by analysis.

Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): I love those points because actually, like, um, I don't see risk as negative, you know, like I—I just see that as being pragmatic. And, um, I—one of my weird things, right, is I can see a million steps ahead. I can see into the future, which is like—it's a positive and a negative because I can see everything that could possibly go wrong, which some might view as pessimism, but like, if I can play a million steps ahead, then I can think of all the things I could do to account for that.

Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): Um, was just having a conversation with my client last night, who has two really great deals in hand, you know, and it's like, which one do I choose? And I was like, normally it's like kind of looking at the upside, and both could have potential upside. I was like, all right, model it like 20% down and sit there and like, brainstorm all the things you're gonna do if you have a 20% revenue drop. Right? And—and how do you feel—like, how equipped do you feel to handle that in this one or that one? And sometimes going into the worst case scenario, it's not necessarily being negative, it's—it's—it's being responsible and it's also thinking like, what am I gonna do about it?

Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): Um, my team will know this about me. Like, I hate people that just complain and bring up problems. Like, it's a trigger for me, not my kind of vibe at all, but I wanna hear, Hey, I'm seeing this. It's a challenge. Here's the solution. I'm like, yes, go. Let's do it. So like, if you see a problem or you see a challenge or you see a flag—are you thinking like, what's the solution? Or how do I handle this?

Will Smith (Acquiring Minds): Great. Uh, what was the name—the—the name again that you recommend on mind shift? Was that Big Leap or was that a different one?

Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): Yeah, there's a book called The Big Leap by Gay Hendricks. Um, I'm reading a book called E-Squared right now, which I'm really enjoying. It's about manifesting stuff.

Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): Ooh, actually an amazing book that, um, this is a fun one. I was actually reading this while I was going after the $8 million deal and raising $3 million. Um, it's called Existential Kink, and it's actually about the things that our brain likes that we perceive as negative—our existential crisises, the things that we like, latch onto, these bad things that happen in life—and how it's actually like, how come people only have like kinks in the bedroom for like, weird stuff that would normally be like, painful and how we manifest that in life as well. And this was transformational for me, and I think it, you know, in part reading this book while I was going after that deal made me get out of my own head to go after something that I felt was like insane, right? Like, who tries to raise $3 million over a Labor Day weekend? Like, it was crazy. And I was just having so much fun with it. I was like, I named the—the negative alter ego that I had in my life that would normally like, hold me back or tell me I couldn't do it. So that's a phenomenal read. It's, you know, the existential kink that we create in our lives.

Will Smith (Acquiring Minds): Great. What a name. Uh, it was a good—good titling. 'Cause you're like, oh, what is that?

Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): Yeah. Um, and it's—it's actually all about how our mind, you know, tends to want the bad things that happen to us also. Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

Will Smith (Acquiring Minds): Uh, last question and then we'll wrap it up. Everybody—just, you mentioned business therapists. Uh, are they regular therapists specializing in supporting business owners, or is this another name for business coaches? Good question.

Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): You know, um, my—my therapist loves that I call her my business therapist. It's not—and she's like, I might need to like start naming myself that way. Um, she—my therapist that I found was, you know, trained therapist in all the modalities, but also a business coach. She liked working with entrepreneurs. So she's able to pull in, like, depending on where I'm at, sometimes I just need to talk through all the stuff happening at work. Other times I need to like, sit there and do some weird energy clearing thing that she has me do that doesn't seem like it works. And then all of a sudden I don't have that—that issue anymore. Um, so she's able to move through modalities, but I don't think it's an actual thing out there.

Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): But what I would say is, you know, a—a therapist—a lot of people don't choose their therapists in the right way. It's very much like, who do I feel comfortable with and am I gonna get growth and progress from them? Um, so somebody that doesn't understand business language is not a good fit for me because business is a love language and it's all I talk about, you know, friendships as well. It's very hard for me to connect with someone if I can't talk about business stuff with them. So, you know, just finding a therapist that you have common ground with, or a business coach that maybe has done some—some therapy training or whatever, they exist out there, you know, because the best, you know, uh, performers in the world, the—the business folks, they have people like that that advise them when they're—they need that additional support.

Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): There's no separation between our trauma and our triggers and our emotions and how we show up in business, especially when it's incredibly high stakes.

Will Smith (Acquiring Minds): Great, great stuff, Athena. Well, thank you again for a wonderful presentation. Um, nobody can match your—your energy and enthusiasm, Athena, um, really dense, uh, packed, uh, content as well. Everybody, you'll get that in your inboxes, uh, by end of day tomorrow, including a distillation of all that in the form of the checklist and the video itself. Um, and by the way, you heard Athena mention her, uh, part one—uh, this—this was kind of a part two, the part one of the series, which we did a month ago. Uh, there's the link to that, so you can go watch that and, um, get yourself on Athena's waiting list because she can't—can't help you right now. She's—she's booked—not, not until probably early part of next year, uh, will she be available. So start the conversation soon if you're serious about working with her. And anything else, Athena?

Athena Simpson (AcquiMatch): No, uh, Will, I just always want to thank you for starting, uh, this—this, you know, amazing resource for all of us. I have learned a lot from you. Everybody learns a lot from you. Um, I really appreciate what you're doing for this community and telling the real stories and giving the real, you know, stuff that will help people. So thank you. I know it's a—a very hard thing to do on your end. So appreciate you and thank you for letting me share stuff I'm passionate about in my weird and wacky way.

Will Smith (Acquiring Minds): Very gracious of you. I appreciate that Athena very much. Thank you. And thank you everyone for coming. Thanks for your attention. Uh, thank you Athena Simpson once again. This ends the webinar. Bye everyone.
