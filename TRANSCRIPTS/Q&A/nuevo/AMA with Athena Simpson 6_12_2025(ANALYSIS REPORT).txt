[Error #1 - Category: Entity Name (Company)]
Location: ~00:00:50 / Speaker: Athena
Transcript excerpt: "my name's Athena Simpson. I am the founder of AC iMatch."
Issue: Company name rendered inconsistently as "AC iMatch"
Likely intended: "AcquiMatch" (also appears later as “Acqui Match”/“Acme Match”/“Asset Match”)
Confidence: High
Reasoning: Multiple inconsistent renderings of the same company across the transcript indicate ASR confusion.
Impact: Medium – brand clarity and searchability

[Error #2 - Category: Misheard Acronym/Term]
Location: ~00:07:40 / Speaker: Athena
Transcript excerpt: "who's a good, trusted, QV provider or lawyer"
Issue: "QV provider" is nonstandard in M&A due diligence context
Likely intended: "QoE provider" (Quality of Earnings)
Confidence: High
Reasoning: In ETA/SBA deals, “QoE” is standard; later mentions show inconsistent forms (“QVs,” “Q of E”).
Impact: High – key due diligence function

[Error #3 - Category: Business Terminology Distortion]
Location: ~00:11:20 / Speaker: Athena
Transcript excerpt: "because it was para pursue and he wanted to cover his own risk"
Issue: “para pursue” is a misrendering of a common finance term
Likely intended: “pari passu”
Confidence: High
Reasoning: Pari passu is standard in capital stack structuring; later repeated as “Perry Passio.”
Impact: High – affects understanding of loan/equity structure

[Error #4 - Category: Entity Name (Company)]
Location: ~00:16:50 / Speaker: Athena
Transcript excerpt: "that's actually how Acme Match was born"
Issue: Misnaming of the company
Likely intended: "AcquiMatch"
Confidence: High
Reasoning: Company is elsewhere called AcquiMatch; “Acme Match” is phonetically similar but incorrect.
Impact: Medium

[Error #5 - Category: Financial/Terminology Error]
Location: ~00:27:10 / Speaker: Athena
Transcript excerpt: "figuring out their add-backs, what their SCE is"
Issue: "SCE" is incorrect in this context
Likely intended: "SDE" (Seller’s Discretionary Earnings)
Confidence: High
Reasoning: SDE is a core metric in sub-$5M acquisitions; “SCE” is nonstandard.
Impact: High – financial metric misidentification

[Error #6 - Category: Semantic Inconsistency / Terminology]
Location: ~00:27:40 / Speaker: Athena
Transcript excerpt: "There's a lot of reverse care kickers out there"
Issue: Phrase is nonsensical in context
Likely intended: "tire kickers"

Impact: Medium

[Error #7 - Category: Entity Name (Lender)]
Location: ~00:40:30 / Speaker: Athena
Transcript excerpt: "live vote rates all our buyers as, a's"
Issue: Misrendering of lender name and phrase
Likely intended: "Live Oak rates all our buyers as A’s" (Live Oak Bank)
Confidence: High
Reasoning: Live Oak Bank is a major SBA lender; “live vote” is phonetic ASR error.
Impact: High – lender credibility/reference

[Error #8 - Category: Misheard Acronym]
Location: ~01:10:10 / Speaker: Athena
Transcript excerpt: "she remembers every NBA she signs"
Issue: “NBA” in contract context is incorrect
Likely intended: “NDA” (Non-Disclosure Agreement)
Confidence: High
Reasoning: NDAs are standard with brokers/sellers; “NBA” is a common ASR slip.
Impact: High

[Error #9 - Category: Misheard Acronym]
Location: ~00:27:00 and ~01:10:15 / Speakers: Athena
Transcript excerpt: "NDA signed sim reviewed" / "whether she got the sim"
Issue: “sim” likely incorrect for M&A document
Likely intended: “CIM” (Confidential Information Memorandum)
Confidence: High
Reasoning: CIM is the standard document term in on-market deals.
Impact: High

[Error #10 - Category: Speaker/Entity Name Inconsistency]
Location: ~00:06:30 and ~00:29:00 / Speakers: Athena and “Anke”
Transcript excerpt: "Anka, who is our operations manager" vs. speaker label "**Anke:**"
Issue: Inconsistent spelling of team member’s name
Likely intended: One consistent spelling (likely “Anka” given intro)
Confidence: Medium
Reasoning: Initial introduction uses “Anka”; later speaker label shows “Anke”.
Impact: Medium – clarity on who is speaking

[Error #11 - Category: Entity Name (Company)]
Location: ~00:55:00 / Speaker: Austin
Transcript excerpt: "here at Asset Match"
Issue: Misnaming the company
Likely intended: "AcquiMatch"

Impact: Medium

[Error #12 - Category: Misheard Acronym]
Location: ~00:54:00 / Speaker: Austin
Transcript excerpt: "folks that don't qualify for SVA style transactions"
Issue: “SVA” is incorrect in financing context
Likely intended: “SBA” (Small Business Administration)
Confidence: High
Reasoning: SBA is the relevant program for these deals; “SVA” has no meaning here.
Impact: High

[Error #13 - Category: Organization Name]
Location: ~01:07:15 / Speaker: Athena
Transcript excerpt: "the, uh, Texas Association, a business brokers annual meetup"
Issue: Organization name garbled
Likely intended: "Texas Association of Business Brokers (TABB) annual meetup"
Confidence: High
Reasoning: TABB is the known state association; phrasing sounds like ASR fragmentation.
Impact: Medium

[Error #14 - Category: Semantic/Omission]
Location: ~00:36:00 / Speaker: Athena
Transcript excerpt: "It was in Dallas, uh, Austin is like. We only take on one client at a time"
Issue: Ambiguity whether “Austin” is the city or the person; sentence truncated

Impact: Medium – potential confusion

[Error #15 - Category: Business Terminology Distortion]
Location: ~00:58:45 / Speaker: Athena
Transcript excerpt: "I'm sure there's some flex there in terms of, um, it"
Issue: Minor truncation/omission of a noun after “in terms of”
Likely intended: “in terms of [deal specifics/industry/financials]”
Confidence: Low
Reasoning: Spoken filler likely clipped; not critical but slightly confusing.
Impact: Low

[Error #16 - Category: Semantic Nonsense]
Location: ~01:17:45 / Speaker: Athena
Transcript excerpt: "show you some of the amazing people we have Aren in the scenes"
Issue: Phrase is nonsensical

[REMOVAL #1 - Type: Small Talk/Personal Aside]
Location: ~00:55:00
Speakers involved: Athena, Austin
Content excerpt:
"Athena: ... my dogs are going crazy. I think someone's at the door.
Austin: No, you're good. I'm like, I can't hear it on side."
Reasoning:
Purely personal aside about background noise; no business relevance.
Context impact: None—removing does not affect adjacent content.
Recommended action: REMOVE these 2 lines around ~00:55:00.

[REMOVAL #2 - Type: Personal/Off-Topic]
Location: ~01:00:10
Speakers involved: Athena
Content excerpt:
"…you can't read it, but my necklace says savage. Like, I am sweet, but I'm also mama bear…"
Reasoning:
Personal fashion/joke aside; not necessary for business understanding.
Context impact: Low—the surrounding broker-incentives discussion remains clear.
Recommended action: REMOVE the “necklace says savage” sentence only.

[REMOVAL #3 - Type: Small Talk/Joke]
Location: ~01:17:15-01:17:30
Speakers involved: Athena
Content excerpt:
"…Thanks for… expertly guiding us through the questions. That was really helpful. Probably more fun than watching me, like, you know, my forehead read the, the questions as they came through"
Reasoning:
Humorous aside about reading questions; no business content.
Context impact: None—closing still makes sense without this joke.
Recommended action: REMOVE this sentence.


[BORDERLINE #1 - Requires Review]
Location: ~00:38:00
Content excerpt: "…we had a lot of fun phone calls about being a business owner and tubing, you know, here in Texas…"
Business relevance argument: Used to illustrate rapport-building approaches in off-market outreach.
Personal content argument: The “tubing” reference is a casual personal activity unrelated to M&A.
Recommendation: KEEP—serves as an example of building seller trust.

[BORDERLINE #2 - Requires Review]
Location: ~01:12:00
Content excerpt: "…I'm lucky if I get to spend time with my boyfriend in the evening 'cause I'm like working…"
Business relevance argument: Illustrates time demands and non-passive nature of ownership.
Personal content argument: References to boyfriend and evening schedule are personal.
Recommendation: KEEP—supports a key point about lifestyle trade-offs for buyers.


Notes on Patterns/ASR Issues
- QoE consistently misrendered (“QV,” “QVs,” “Q of E”)—watch for QoE normalization.
- Company name is inconsistent throughout (“AC iMatch,” “Acqui Match,” “Acme Match,” “Asset Match”)—should be standardized to AcquiMatch.
- Multiple “pari passu” distortions (“para pursue,” “Perry Passio”)—common ASR slip in finance jargon.
- Core acronyms frequently misheard: NDA→NBA, CIM→sim, SBA→SVA.
- Lender name misheard: Live Oak→live vote.

Speaker Attribution/Flow
- Potential confusion where “Austin” could refer to the team member or the city (around ~00:36:00). Recommend review to ensure clarity.
- Name inconsistency for operations manager (“Anka” vs “Anke”).
