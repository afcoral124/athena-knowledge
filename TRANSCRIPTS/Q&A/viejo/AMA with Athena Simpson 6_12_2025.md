# AMA /6/12/25

[00:00:00] 

**Athena:** Hello. Welcome, welcome. Uh, got a few people joining, which is kind of exciting. We've never done any one of these before, so we're kind of excited to see what comes up in this and really, um, doing the webinar with Will. I've been a huge fan of his ever since I discovered him, as I'm sure all of you are.

So, um, you should already know me. I'm assuming everybody came here from the webinar. Uh, I heard a bit of my introduction, but my name's Athena Simpson. I am the founder of AC iMatch. Um, and I brought a few of my team here so you can see some of the faces behind what we do. Um, and for today with this, ask me anything we just wanted to offer some time.

There was a lot of questions we weren't able to get to in the webinar. Um, so it's time for people to ask questions so you can ask questions, uh, about. Your own personal situation if you want. I'm really big on trying to give back and, and just help people, whether you work with [00:01:00] us or not. I wish I had more access to that kind of sell when I was a, a searcher.

Um, so you know about how to figure out your deal box or sourcing or analyzing a deal or SBA structuring. I know we started getting in the weeds with like, what can be counted, what can't. Um, and it's this really fun thing right now where the SOPs changing every minute. So we're staying on top of that as much as we can.

So happy to answer, uh, all your questions around deal sourcing and that sort of thing. Um, there was also some questions around how we work. Um, so I'm just gonna get a little overview 'cause I didn't want to really make the last session a sales pitch. Just wanted to leave you all with information about what are some of the services and options that are out there.

Uh, especially for first time buyers. Um, you know, I, I felt left out when I was in my search process. Um, and that's what drove me to create this company. So what we do is very, very different from a lot of the folks that you're gonna come across that either do [00:02:00] sourcing or buy-side advisory. And the thing that makes us different is I, I call what we do acquisition matchmaking.

So imagine you want to, you know, find a partner and you don't wanna sift through Tinder and look through all those things, and it's like Tinder's serving you up people that aren't necessarily a good fit. So you go to a matchmaker and you say, I want a six foot four blonde with blue eyes in finance and a trust fund.

And the matchmaker's gonna be like, okay. Let's get to know you a little bit more, and then I'll go and see if I have any options like that. When we know that that is like the fraction of the percent of the population, the matchmaker might come back and say, Hey, so I found this five 10 brunette who you share the same values.

You guys grew up in the same place. I think you're really gonna get along. You should go on a date. So we do that for business buying for first time buyers, because when you're a first time buyer, especially if you've never been a business owner, this idea of business [00:03:00] ownership is a theory and it's one that's really exciting, especially with what's going on in the internet.

And everybody's selling this dream of buying a business and putting in an operator and going and sitting on a beach and cash flow is just hitting your bank account. Um, and that's not the case at all, right? Like, I'm, I'm not an influencer. I'm very reticent to put myself out there, but I know I need to as a founder.

Um, that's why a lot of the, the businesses that we come across, they don't do the marketing. They wanna do the work. Um, but anyways, this dream that a lot of us are, are buying into of autonomy over our life, of our schedule, of generational wealth, of being able to be the one that makes the decisions, it's so enticing and exciting.

Um, but when you're doing this for the first time, and if you've never been a business owner or worked in a small business, you are working off a theory. You're working off an assumption. So what we do at Acqui Match is we spend one to two months getting to know our clients and [00:04:00] really deeply getting to know what's their values, vision, skillset, what's gonna, you know, be a good life for them in five, 10 years?

How does business ownership fit into that? What are the skill sets that they can bring to business ownership? What are their interest areas? Um, and we do that because, you know, I've, I've been a consultant, uh, for, gosh, 20 years. I've consulted every stage startup founder company you can imagine. And honestly, if you're not a good fit for what you're doing or if you're not in the right thing, you're, you're gonna solve the business.

So you could buy a business that was functioning exceptionally well, and you put yourself in the seat of something that you were not equipped or excited about, and you will take that business. And I didn't wanna see people doing that. So we use that kind of consulting, advisory, coaching, almost like psychological background to understand who you are and what's gonna be a good fit for you, so that when we're looking at businesses for [00:05:00] you, we're assessing not only is this a good business, but is it a good business for you?

And I don't think we talk about this enough, right, in ETA, because this is not a passive investment. If you're using SBA and you're putting a personal guarantee on the line and you're looking at sub 5 million in purchase price, no. You won't put an operator in and have them run the business while you go sit on a beach, right?

Like you could bankrupt yourself. And there's not really a business of that size that the owner doesn't need to be involved in one way or another. Um, so we help people test their assumptions while we put deals in front of them, refine that deal box criteria, figure out what would be a good fit, and then also figure out if business ownership is for you.

Um, and the truth of the matter is it's not for everybody. Um. That's why a lot of people don't start businesses. They have the idea, but they don't actually take the action. Being a business owner, you have to be a special kind of crazy because you have all the decisions weighing on your shoulders. You have [00:06:00] a bunch of people's livelihoods on your shoulders.

Um, so I've got a few of them here with me. Uh, Austin, who's our account exec, he's the first person that you'll talk to and he'll assess whether he thinks he'd be a good fit for our service. Anka, who is our operations manager. And she does phenomenal systems and processes for us to be able to analyze a high volume of deals.

Luke is one of our analysts and he goes and finds and vets the opportunities before they hit our client's dashboards. Um, and he's got an exceptional background in consulting, investment banking, um, and really puts heart into what he does in terms of assessing whether it's a good fit for the client or not.

And then ADA's at the front end of that and she is, I used to call her our unofficial broker and owner chaser. 'cause a lot of what we're doing is moving things through the funnel and getting them a vetted opportunity in front of our clients. So she's absolutely integral in that. So ask them here today to just kind of show you some faces, [00:07:00] um, because this company would not exist without them.

I just get the, uh, benefit of going out and representing us and all these amazing humans. Um, so thanks guys for being here. Um, so. When we put a match in front of a client, then it's over to them to kind of take it forward. So just like you would go to a matchmaker, they're gonna be an introduction for you to go on a blind date and decide if you wanna date that person and if you want to get into a relationship, right?

Same thing with business buying. Like is this the business that you wanna go forward on? And if it is, how do you approach that? So then we flip into an advisor mode after we've gone out and found those matches for you. And we're here to run things by or who do I need for this? Uh, like who's a good, trusted, uh, QV provider or lawyer, or what lenders should I go to this or how should I approach structuring this?

So we're a thought partner, um, but it's a done with you kind of service. So it's really down to the, the person to take the deal forward, [00:08:00] um, which is a little bit different than some of the buy-side brokers out there. And they're gonna be out there negotiating the deal for you. So the way that we work is we match you and then you take it forward from there and we're behind you cheering you on, um, to get you over the finish line.

So, um, Austin, do we have any questions that have come up in the chat? I'm just gonna leave it there. This isn't meant to be a sales pitch. Uh, we're actually booked out very far right now for new clients. So I will press this, that. Um, but wanna give value and answer questions in the meantime so I can help you in your own search journey, whether you want to try to work with us or not.

So, um, Austin, any questions that are coming through or, um, any other questions actually from the webinar too, we have the list there that we can start answering while we give you all that are in, um, the room there some time to type your questions in the chat and you can just go ahead and type 'em in the chat.

We don't have the q and a function like Will does. We don't have that version of Zoom, so go ahead and type in the chat and then awesome. We'll read 'em off as they come through and [00:09:00] then we'll just start picking some questions from the last webinar in the meantime. 

**Austin:** Yeah. Yeah, absolutely. I'll, uh, I'll pull a few in from the previous webinar.

I see some of the familiar names in our chat here, so looking forward to, to meeting you all if I haven't yet, but I think I'll kick us off. I think this'll, this'll be a fun story, Athena. It's like, um, from our last meeting someone was talking about like incredible how quickly you were able to raise that $3 million in equity to go chase that opportunity we're looking for, um, really just asking for additional color and like how you were able to accomplish that.

**Athena:** Yeah. So, um, I, I believe everybody was here at the last webinar, but I'll just give a quick reminder of that story. I actually started out as a searcher myself. I was a business consultant who is. Not wanting to have to keep trading my time for money. So when I discovered this world of ETA, it was hooked.

Um, and I went through all the normal things that people do, looking at laundromats and car washes, and, um, [00:10:00] looked at like an event rental equipment company and learned deeply about CapEx and $17 million garage sales of equipment that I would've had to take over. But I found one that, uh, it was a property management company and it wasn't even an industry that I was considering for myself, it was on market, which I was like, I was dead set against on market at the time because I was told the same stories about bad brokers and everything.

And I had a friend challenge me like, you gotta start looking on market. So I found this deal that was. A perfect match for me, for my skillset, for my values, for everything that I wanted to do. They did something that I couldn't see anyone else out there doing. So they had this moat, they had insane growth.

It was all relationship based, which is a lot of what my career is based on. Hello Matchmaker. I love relationships. I love making those connections. Um, and I was able to be the only one to actually get to meet the owner in person out of 14 [00:11:00] offers on this business. It was 2 million in ebitda and I made an $8 million offer because I was working with the lender that the broker introduced me to, to try to figure out how to structure it.

But we worked out that I like the way he had me structure it because it was para pursue and he wanted to cover his own risk, was that I needed to bring $3 million to the table. I didn't have that, so I had to go out and raise it. Um, but my background is raising money with startups. Right. I've helped.

Hundreds of startups raise money. I used to advise the investment community specifically in food tech in my past business, um, and then corporates and doing minority investments and, uh, acquisitions of the startups that were in our community. So I've been around raising a lot and I kind of knew some tactics from then.

And when I was running around being a searcher, I was so obsessed with it. It was all I talked about. So anybody that I talked to that showed interest that I thought could be a potential investor. [00:12:00] Um, I wrote down their name. It's just like, I don't know if I'm ever gonna need this, but I know this person has money.

They were super interested. They like me. So let me just, so I had this list of people and then I was faced with losing this deal if I didn't bring $3 million. And in, uh, soft circled, so people, investors legitimately telling me they would commit to this round, it's called soft circling. I had to bring that to the lender, um, with their profiles, confirmation letters from them, everything.

And then the lender would then green light to the broker, like, yeah, she can actually finance this deal. So I, I was so confident at the time too, this was like, how hilarious it was. I was like, well, I am like the obvious buyer here. So I went to the broker and I was like, Hey, so you guys think I'm the right owner of this business, right?

And he's like. There's a lot of good potential owners, Athena. And I was like, well, I mean, we got along super [00:13:00] well. So I think I should be the owner of this business and I have a solution for how I can finance it. I just need some time. And he is like, okay, what is it? And in my head, this was like a totally reasonable request at the time because I was like, I know I can do this.

And I was like, so I just need to raise $3 million. He was like, Athena, like there are people that have the money right now. And I was like, I just need some time. How long can you give me? And this was Friday before Labor Day weekend. Um, and he is like, I will give you until Wednesday. And I was like, it's the end of the day before a three day weekend.

Like, what do you mean? And he's like, I don't know what to tell you Athena. There's other people that can buy this business that have the money. I'll give you until Wednesday. So that was one of those moments, right? And I see our clients go through these moments. It's like a make or break moment, like, what am I gonna do?

And I was like, well, I have nothing to lose except this business. And I love this business so much. And I have this list of people that I've been talking to about ETA as a concept. [00:14:00] And I also had other fellow searchers that were close to me that I knew had looked at this deal and passed it up, right? So I knew, like two of my investors that I ended up getting money from had looked at this deal and passed it up because they miss the diamond in the rough.

And that's what happens a lot when people are searching on their own and they get, you know? Mm-hmm. So, um, I went around and I asked everybody for their advice. So this is a big like investment. If you're raising money, if you ask for money, you'll get advice. So I went around to everybody. I was like, okay, here's this situation I'm in.

Here's this business. I am gonna lose it if I don't raise $3 million. What do you think? And literally every single one of 'em, and these were all people that knew me well enough, knew my background, obviously they knew my credibility. I was a lecturer at one of the top business schools in the country at this point.

Mm-hmm. Like me as a potential operator, I will, I will give myself that. Like I had the credibility and the relationship with these folks. Um, and [00:15:00] every single one of 'em at the end of like me asking like, what do you think? They're all like, what's the minimum? And I was like, mm-hmm. I'm so glad you asked.

It's 250,000. Like, I didn't know what I was doing or how to structure. I'd never structured a deal like this, only in startup plan. Mm-hmm. But it's very different in this world. Very. And there was no helpful Sam Rosati, uh, you know, webinars on Will's platform talking about these kinds of structures and stuff.

So like literally Tuesday night, 5:00 PM. I was 500,000 short and I, I had my final phone call scheduled with somebody that actually didn't know me. It was just a, a warm introduction and he ripped me a new one. So he was just like this, like the terms like la la la and I was like, this is awesome information.

Thank you so much. I actually needed information like this. And the way I handled myself when he was ripping me a new one, he's like, alright. He's like, how much are you short? And I was like, [00:16:00] 500. And he is like, put me down for it. So next morning went into the, the banker, you know, with my soft circled letters and profiles of all the investors.

And I thought for sure I was issuing for that deal. Um, and turns out somebody offered 2 million more than me. Uh, private equity. And I lost it. And knowing what I do now about structuring, I actually could have matched that offer without putting myself at risk. You know, it was just how that money that I raised was being put to work.

And when you lean on the lenders to tell you how to structure things, they're gonna structure it to protect themselves, not to help you with the deal. Right? So, um, so that fueled me to like, not let that happen to other people if I can. Right. And, um, also, two of my investors needed searches run for them.

They didn't have time. So I figured, well, let me, let me do that for them while I continue my own search. And, and that's actually how Acme Match was born. 'cause I realized like I was born to do this. I love it more than [00:17:00] anything. So it's the one that got away and I go to the website a bunch, but that's, that's how I raise the money.

**Austin:** Now we, we get the benefit of making entrepreneurship through acquisition more accessible to our clients was just a, such a phenomenal gift. And yeah. Thank you for telling that, that story, Athena, I'm sure it resonated with a lot of folks on our call today. Um, maybe moving on here, what are, what are some of the key characteristics that you look for, um, in an ideal fit for what we do here at Aqui Match Athena?

**Athena:** It, it, that's a great question. Um, I, I don't believe that business ownership is for everybody. I really don't. Um, it's, it's one of the scariest, most stressful, craziest things you'll ever take on. Even if you're buying a business. You know, you're just buying something that somebody took from zero to one and hoping that you can at least keep it at one and maybe get it a little bit more forward.

But if you've never owned a business before and you've [00:18:00] always worked for someone else, you've not been in the seat of mm-hmm. All the decisions on your shoulders of having to push through no matter what, of if something goes wrong, guess who's on the tools. If one of my team need vacation, guess who covers 'em?

You know, like most of these businesses are not big enough to avoid things like that. So, and I, I, I was a, we had, um, we do an internal buyers club for our clients. So it's like twice a week where our clients get to come on and we bring external experts and business owners, and we had a business owner who had bought a business.

Everything went wrong. Uh, you know, fraud, the owner competed, like all sorts of things. It was wild. And, um, you know, they stuck with it. They, and now they're a profitable business despite all of that. But most people would, would give up in that moment. So I say all that to say that what. It's not [00:19:00] about financial.

I mean, there's, there's a financial component, right? Like, do you, do you have the ability to finance the loan? But it's so much more than that. Do you have resilience and, and like really tough resilience? Like you've had some of the worst things happen to you and you pick yourself up and you figure it out.

Mm-hmm. When you are faced with a challenge, do you freeze? Do you flee or do you fight because you need to be a fighter and like you're, you could be crying, you could be, you know, that's what I was talking about with this business owner. I'm like, I cry once a week and I love my business and everything's going great, you know, but like the weight of that kind of pressure and stress.

Um, so resilience, growth, mindset. Massive problem solving. You fight when there's challenges, and then the soft skills of that is what's, what's your leadership ability? You know? Mm-hmm. And this isn't something that's just natural. Like have you trained yourself on leading people? What are you like leading people?

[00:20:00] Because people are at the heart of every single business. So if you're not good at managing and leading people, inspiring people, interacting well with people, the likelihood of you being successful as a business owner is pretty low. So, um, I mean, Austin, you know this, you're at the front end and, and we turn away more people than way more people than we accept because we're assessing, like, do we think that you will be able to be a good business owner?

Or would we feel bad pushing you towards something that we know that you won't be successful at? 

**Austin:** Yeah, I might, I might add to that a little bit, Athena, in the sense of like the non-monetary component of being a business owner, right? Is like when we get, um, folks, and there's nothing wrong with it, like with more of a stronger finance background and sometimes they do have non-monetary motivations as to why they want to get into entrepreneurship through acquisition.

But like, if you're looking at this as an asset class, just like any other, right, it's like you're typically gonna inevitably run into problems and when things [00:21:00] get tough, it's really hard to get out of bed the next day and tackle those challenges head on. So one of the things that I really focus on, um, in those initial conversations is understanding like, hey, what's actually motivating this decision?

And are you running towards something or running away? Um, and there's not necessarily a right or wrong answer on either side of that, but just understanding some of the non-monetary component. So, um, yeah, definitely appreciate the Kelly there. 

**Athena:** Yeah. And, and it's a, it's a good point, right? This is not a passive investment.

It is not at all in any way, shape or form a passive investment. You will not get past lending if you go to a lender and say, I'm gonna put an operator and I'm gonna live in a different state from this business. Unless you have a history of being able to do that successfully in the past, right? So a lot of what we have to do, I think is, is break dreams before we build new ones.

Um, because I'm, I'm gonna tell it to you honestly, because I have too much integrity, which is, you know, it probably cost me a lot of revenue by having that kind of integrity to say, I don't think [00:22:00] this is for you, but I, you know, I, I'm not a salesperson. I've always been on the operational delivery kind of consulting side, and I want what's best for the person.

So, um, you know, if, if, if you're just looking at this purely from a financial component component, you really need to have a serious talk with yourself at, if this is the asset class for you. 

**Austin:** Agreed. Agreed. Well, a couple questions came in somewhat similar, but maybe talk to us about sourcing strategies.

How are we going out actually finding deals and looking at both like the on and off market components of what we do here at AC iMatch? 

**Athena:** Yeah. Great questions. So, um, we want to look on and off market for a couple reasons, right? The, the theory that you have of your deal box that is best stress tested and refined.

With, with getting a lot of reps in. So if we were to just do off market for you, you're gonna be [00:23:00] waiting a long time before you're speaking to those owners. And then when you do get in front of those owners, you're not experienced enough to be able to act as broker and buyer in that conversation. So on market delivers a lot of volume of deals.

Um, and honestly, if it's the right deal for, for you, I don't care where it comes from on market's a little bit more competitive, right? So you have to have a competitive spirit and quick action taking to be able to move on those. And we can work you through that. Um, off market you have to have exceptional eq negotiation, coaching, education.

Like there's a lot that you need to do with off market that it, it, it, a lot of people don't consider that. Mm-hmm. So the way that we source is we do that, that onboarding process of spending one to two months really getting to know you. The team builds out these. Insane profiles on our clients. Like, you know, there's psychological backgrounds, we're assessing, [00:24:00] you know, what kind of motivates them, what holds them back, what kind of decision maker they are, what their skill sets are, what they'll be good at.

Mm-hmm. What their interests areas are. You know, trying to figure out like, okay, well if we drop this person into a business, what components need to be around them for them to be successful? Mm-hmm. What's gonna, what's gonna drive them forward on this business? So once we have that, then all of our clients, we want you to be somewhat industry agnostic, because if you just have one industry in mind, we'll refer you out to somebody that sources that.

Um, 'cause we are more like the, the matchmaker, right? We wanna find the right deal for you that's gonna get you outta bed, that's gonna excite you, that you're gonna be successful at. If you're dead set on a certain industry and you have that experience, by all means go to one of the hunters that'll just put leads in front of you.

Um, we have a whole team, so there's about five people that touch a deal on market before it gets to one of our clients. And it's this funnel that we go through or eliminating deals at [00:25:00] every stage deeper and deeper. Mm-hmm. On the criteria that we create, we have over a hundred on market sources. We also have a team that specifically go out and hunt on market deals.

Uh, and then we also have a team that researches business owners off market, which we reach out to. Primarily on email, but we do some of the other stuff like, uh, phone calls. We're experimenting with some stuff that nobody else does for sure. Um, that's, that's kind of like me turning on my marketing brain where I'm like, this is so fun.

Oh, we also do LinkedIn. Um, but our point of difference, and the reason why we get the results that we do is because we're representing real people who want to be business owners. We don't come across as private equity or investors. These business owners are hit up. Every day from somebody trying to buy their business.

And all the outreach sounds the same. So as you might have noticed behind me, I'm a little bit different, your normal like m and a person. And it's the same thing with that, how we reach out to people. There's a lot of heart and care and [00:26:00] these people are business owners. They care about their businesses.

So, um, you know, our team create a lot of trust and rapport with these folks to get them warm enough to make an introduction to a client. Mm-hmm. Um, that could take time, right? So yesterday a client just went under offer on an off market business, um, like less than a two x over a million in ebitda. Just an amazing relationship with the owners.

Um, and we worked that deal for a year before we got it in front of them, right? Like, so people's timelines. How long it takes to find a deal? Well, it's not just like canvassing everything. It's like when the owner's in that mindset like, okay, today's the day I'm ready to have that conversation. Um, so, and it took him five weeks to negotiate the LOI.

Um, anyways, just timings. I like, I like putting that out there 'cause people's expectations of how long things take is, is [00:27:00] significantly lower than what it should be. Um, so on market, there's a team that's touching it at different points, uh, and they do an exceptional job of moving it through very quickly, uh, and getting calls scheduled.

So before a deal hits a client's inbox, it will have been reviewed, deeply reviewed, NDA signed sim reviewed broker call scheduled, and then there's a whole writeup, uh, and top line analysis mm-hmm. And video of review of that business before we hand it over off market, we're reaching out to the owners.

Since checking that they're in the range of, you know, a good fit, financial and quality wise. Then we're walking them through kind of getting their financials, figuring out their add-backs, what their SCE is, you know, what their valuation expectations are, and that they are actually ready to sell. There's a lot of reverse mm-hmm.

Care kickers out there. Um, and then we'll make an introduction from there. So hopefully that answered the question there on the sourcing. 

**Austin:** Yeah, absolutely. And I, I, one of the questions was like, what, how do we differentiate? And I would [00:28:00] say that maybe to, to add to what you were saying is like that emotional or EQ component, right?

When you. Talk to brokers, that tends to feel fairly transactional. And one thing we're really good about is like being able to, to get our clients in front of, um, the actual seller before submitting an LOI on those transactions. Um, and maybe you can even speak a, a bit further, Athena about like, some of the coaching that goes into like, those owner conversations.

Right. And one of my favorite things to tell folks is, um, like I, in a previous life, I, I worked sell side transactions, right? Most of our clients didn't end up taking the highest offer they were after something else. So maybe you could speak to a little bit about some of the coaching that goes around, um, actually getting into those, those seller conversations as well.

**Athena:** Yeah, I mean. These are humans, right? That, that have built businesses for sometimes several decades. And I, I kind of giggle sometimes when people are like, I'm gonna go in and I'm gonna change this and I'm gonna do this and they're [00:29:00] not doing this, so that's bad. And I was like, how long has this owner been running this business for?

Oh, you know, like 35 years. And I was like, so you who's never been a business owner is gonna go in there and like, make it so much better that somebody that's been doing it for 35 years. 

**Anke:** Mm-hmm. So, 

**Athena:** um, there's a little bit of an ego. You check your ego at the door here, you wanna be confident but also reverent to the fact that somebody built something that you were not able to do yourself.

And for those of us that have been serial founders, hello fifth startup now, you know, um, it's really hard to get from zero to one. So somebody that's done that, having some reverence for that and then also. We, you know, a lot of people are insecure about the fact that they're an individual buyer and they're not private equity and they don't have an investment or finance background.

Like your weakness is your strength. Most of these owners would prefer to hand it over to their kids, right? That their kids don't want it. So like [00:30:00] being able to see something in you where they can mentor you and you're gonna take what they built and give it heart and care, take it on and, and run it in their legacy.

Like they care about legacy, you know? Yeah. Money is a component, but I have a client right now and they made a $8 million offer on a roofing business, on market Private equity offered 10 million or 2 million more. Sorry, I'm, it might be seven anyways. The difference between what private equity was offering and what he could offer as an individual buyer were $2 million.

So they entertained the private equity offers and they came back to him because he wasn't going to lock the owner in the business for five years on earnouts, the owner wanted to retire, he wanted to pass his legacy on. So him being like the less expensive, like offering less, but offering more in terms of the lifestyle that this person would get and the legacy that they would leave was more attractive to that [00:31:00] owner.

So now they're, they're going back, um, to the LOI and negotiating an l lo I to go under offer on that. So your strengths mm-hmm. Are actually your, your weaknesses are actually your strengths in my regard. As long as you, you position that in a way, you know, on my deal, like, God, I didn't know what I was doing, but I was like, but I know what, I know I will be the right owner of this business.

So it's that kind of conviction. That you wanna like look for when you're speaking to the owners and we actually coach our clients through like what stage of the relationship mm-hmm. That you're in. Yep. And then depending on the components, like is the broker gate keeping you from the owner? How can you create a relationship with them around that or in and around like the broker, uh, issues.

Um, so most people will go in and they'll just hit the owner hard on that first conversation and start getting in the weeds on the finances and that sort of thing. Mm-hmm. Without asking themselves, like, is this somebody that I get along with? [00:32:00] Do I see myself in them? Do I think I could spend the next 12, 18, 24 months with this person and take on their legacy, like mm-hmm.

To get along. That's, you know, it's kind of like. Proposing on, on the first blind date. You know, first time you meet the owner, that's a blind date. Um, so depending on the, um, how quickly you have to move on it, depending on the competitive situation, we'll coach you in different ways on how you can build that rapport and really assess like, am I a good fit for this business?

Um, that answer the question? 

**Austin:** Yeah, absolutely. I appreciate the, uh, the additional color there. Uh, Athena, I think the, the next one, um, kind of going down the list here is like, um, access to compile data on multiple of SDE different types of businesses that have sold for. So I think the, the cross of this is like, how are we coming to valuations and figuring out like how to make an offer that's compelling while still putting us in a good position to actually like, um, [00:33:00] have that LOI accepted on the backend.

**Athena:** I would love to say that, that it's a sophisticated. Process that you do now. Mm-hmm. But considering there's so many buyers, y'all have driven the price up to what the SBA can afford. You know, like it's based on debt service coverage ratio. It's not based on multiple. So there's some, uh, you know, you, when you're assessing risk, that's what your multiple is based on.

So we're gonna be looking at those risk factors with you. Is there a customer concentration? Is there variability in the previous years? Is there a key man risk? Like what are your risks? And then looking at what I. You want to make afterwards what the asking price is, whether you think that's worth it, whether you think that there's performance note components that you can build in to mitigate your risk or incentivize the seller if that option's available.

Mm-hmm. Honestly, and the, again, I wish it was a more [00:34:00] sophisticated way of doing this 'cause it, it's a little frustrating when we're just in this like wild, wild west gold rush of everybody trying to buy a business and like win the LOI. Um, so the brokers kind of know that, and really anything trading over a four won't qualify for SBA unless there's some like really, um, aggressive structuring around like seller notes and that sort of thing.

Performance based notes potentially, or bringing in investor 

**Austin:** equity. 

**Athena:** Um, so I see most, and we typically don't look at deals below like 500 and SDE. Most of 'em are training around three or four. Um. Then when you go through the SBA process, they're gonna do a business valuation. Some of the lenders will do it earlier on than others, but the SBA will not allow the lender to pay more than the business is valued at.

So you'll have a valuation process through that? No, we don't necessarily have like, access to the, the comps, because even if we had [00:35:00] that, it doesn't really help your negotiating position when everybody else is offering a 3-year-old four. Mm-hmm. And you're trying to come in at a 2.5. So, you know, um, it's, it's a little bit more expensive capital now and you're paying a premium for something that everybody wants.

Mm-hmm. 

**Austin:** Yeah, agreed. I would say that comps are less important in SBA style deals these days for sure. Just with how, how competitive these transactions are. And, and maybe, um, to add to that, Athena, like one question that I'll get asked in selling conversations fairly often is like, when we're submitting Lois, where our clients are submitting lois, like, how many on average would you say other people are, are bidding on, on that transaction?

You know, and I'm sure there's some flex there in terms of, um, it, how good the financials look, what industry it's in, et cetera, you know, but I'm just curious if you have thoughts there. It's 

**Athena:** a really good deal on market in a like, competitive market, like dozens, you know, there's dozens of offers on the business, so [00:36:00] it sucks.

You know, like there was, there was 14 on mine when I was in it, you know, it was in Dallas, uh, Austin is like. We only take on one client at a time. 'cause for whatever reason, all the searchers are in Austin, you know, and it's a tiny, tiny, you know, market when you look at like, businesses that are available.

Um mm-hmm. So, so I go to all of the, the broker events, right? Like I do a lot, like, we do a lot to network with brokers. So they, once they understand what we do and what we're bringing to the table, they love working with us. Um, the, so they, they're a different generation, most of '

**Anke:** em, 

**Athena:** right? And that, you gotta bear that in mind.

Like, they love the fact that they are still handshakes and paper calendars, and they have a way of doing things. It used to be when they listed a business, they maybe got six to eight inquiries on that business. Like when they listed it now. [00:37:00] They list a business and if it's, you know, profitable and been around for a couple years in a hot market, they're getting 200 inquiries in the first hour.

Like 

**Anke:** mm-hmm. It's 

**Athena:** a seller's market. Like it's crazy competitive. And that's the other thing is the Internet's telling you off market is better, and these owners are just sitting there completely oblivious to the fact that they can sell their business and it's mm-hmm. It's not the case at all. They're getting hit.

Every owner that we speak to on the phone, I was like, yeah, I get these all the time, but I never respond. Um, I just introduced an owner to one of our clients who, uh, when we reached out to him, he responded and he is like. You're a scam. These are scams. You know, like people, I've heard of these, these, these people selling their businesses for a hundred percent seller financing and then they're breaking it up for parts and, and the, you know, the team was like, is this lost?

And I was like, okay, here's, here's the strategy. Let's see if we can get this guy to trust us. And I just made an [00:38:00] introduction of him to our clients, right? Like mm-hmm. How you speak to these folks matters. The way you approach them matters. So we went from somebody like, you're a scam. I've never talked to you, to, I can't wait to meet your buyer.

And being super helpful and getting me all the financial information that I needed, answering all my questions, having a lot of fun phone calls about being a business owner and tubing, you know, here in Texas and that sort of thing. So we don't approach it like the other people do when we talk to them.

And, and that's why we're able to get the results we do. 

**Austin:** Love that. Well, this question's come up a few times. I know it was a, a cover or not necessarily covered, but asked in Will's webinar as well. But, um, maybe talk to us a bit about like costs and our structure. Um, a couple questions about, like an example, how does this actually apply to the equity injection?

And let's do it close. So maybe if you, and I'm happy to take this as well, Athena, but either way, uh, just maybe a bit on cost structure here. 

**Athena:** Yeah, so we're a white glove concierge [00:39:00] service. We're gonna, we're gonna customize your search to you. So first we need to understand you and if you're a good fit, and then kind of what the search is gonna look like.

So, um, when you fill out the form, you will be, uh, you know, invited to schedule a call if you meet the initial assessment criteria that we look for. Um, Austin's currently booked out until middle of July, I think. Mm-hmm. We've had a lot more interest than we were prepared for, so that's an amazing thing.

But we're not gonna take on more clients, so we can handle at one time to make sure that everybody's experience is still really good. Um, but when, when we look at like, what you have available and the types of deals. Our fees will make sense if you're looking at deals north of like 1.5 to 2 million, probably more in the 2 million range because what we want mm-hmm is to make sure that your debt service coverage ratio is still above 1.5 with all the fees that you're gonna have to pay at your lawyers [00:40:00] qb.

Mm-hmm The SBA fees with our fees. Um, and then what you're able to do is with those folks that you pay, like us, your QE, your lawyers, if you pay anything out of pocket before you buy the business, then that just gets deducted from the amount you needed to pay for your down payment. There's some caveats to this.

You need to work with lenders that see us as an advisor, right? And we have a bunch of those and, you know, live vote rates all our buyers as, a's, because they wanna work. Mm-hmm. They want the buyers to have someone like us in their corner. So we're kind of considered part of your deal team and your deal expenses.

So as long as you close on a business, you, you will be able to apply what you pay us towards your, um, down payment. So it's essentially like, you know, imagine you have a $200,000 down payment for a $2 million deal and you've paid your advisory team and, [00:41:00] uh, QV and lawyers a hundred k out of pocket. Then you only need to pay the additional a hundred to the bank when it comes time to close.

So, I'm sorry I can't give you a concrete answer, but that's like going to a marketing agency and, and having them, you know, come up with your whole marketing plan and telling you the cost. So that's why I say like, if you have at least 200 k to invest. Um, then our fees may, you know, we, we feel it out of integrity.

Like that's okay. Like that's enough that you can buy deals where we're not gonna break your debt service coverage ratio. 'cause all I care about is your buying power and you being able to buy the right business. So, um, for those of you that are on the lower end of that, we will make exceptions if you're able to raise equity or, or you know, show us that you have investors or additional capital to bring and you are able to go at deals north of 2 million.

We can't help you do that before, if that makes sense. Mm-hmm. So, um, because we have to go out and the brokers, you know, the reason why we have the good relationships that we do with the brokers is 'cause we show up with [00:42:00] a pre-qualified buyer who has the money available and is able to close. 

**Austin:** Mm-hmm. Yeah.

And I'll, uh, I'll maybe even add to that a little, a little bit Athena, like, there's a bit of an upfront, upfront component, something to do on success and like we're really specific about. Who we take on and how we structure these transactions to make sure that it's in your best interest from a. I pull up a spreadsheet on every single call and walk you through exactly, Hey, this is most likely what your attorney fee's going to look like.

This is how much you're gonna pay your Q of E. So prior to moving forward with us, you don't just know our fee. You have a fundamental understanding of like the different fees that you're gonna see along the way in order to actually get that deal across the finish line. So if we're a great fit, we'd love to have you, and if not, we don't, we don't fit everyone's mold.

Um, and maybe kind of circling back to what you're saying about those sub 200 K in terms of investible assets into this project is we're just, we're buried right now in terms of [00:43:00] folks actually reaching out to us. If you are below that threshold, uh, trust me, we haven't forgot about you. We're still very interested in having a conversation.

Um, just give us a few weeks to kind of work through this, uh, this initial interest and we'll be, be reaching out and scheduling, uh, additional conversations there. So. 

**Athena:** It's a, 

**Austin:** it's an 

**Athena:** amazing problem to have, right? As a startup, we've been very much behind the scenes. We've been heads down and just delivering for people rather than like, out there marketing and stuff.

And there's so much interest in what we do and we're really excited about that. So it, it, it's, you know, we don't like the fact that it takes so long to be able to get on the phone with us and, and work with us, but we are hiring, like if you're on my LinkedIn, I've posted, so if, you know great people that wanna join the best like acquisition matchmaking team in the market, we're, we're hiring, but I'm not gonna start people's searches before we brought those people in and train them.

And I'm, I'm confident that it's not gonna affect our current clients or any new clients. So again, I probably leave a lot of money on the table with the way that [00:44:00] I operate, but I'm, I'm a delivery girl, not a sales girl. So I wanna make sure that everybody gets a good service and that we've got the right people in the right seats to make it happen.

**Austin:** Mm-hmm. And then maybe just digging into another question we've got here in the chat is like, talk to us about, um, success rate of clients. Um, not just LOI but actually getting to close. Um, and I think that, um, you'll have some, some great color to share with us here today. 

**Athena:** Yeah, this is a fun question. Um, 'cause it comes from a place of wanting to know what you're, you know, like I want, I want confirmation that I'll be successful.

Um, we're not brokers, so we don't negotiate the deal. We don't take it over the line. We don't run or project manage the process. And, and it's also as much as we try to do our best to help you and us assess whether you're gonna be a good fit as a client. What we look for is our clients making moves on deals that fit their profile and is a [00:45:00] good fit for them and that they're excited about.

Um, what they do after that is a little bit out of our control. And also for me, it's as much of a success if somebody goes through our process and realizes that business ownership is not for them. 'cause this is a 10 year commitment with a multimillion dollar personal guarantee that could potentially bankrupt you.

Mm-hmm. Um, so a lot of folks like that aren't closing are, you know, they've had personal family situations that have made them decide not to pursue this. They've had tough conversations with themselves and realized that business ownership isn't for them. Um, they get job offers that they can't refuse and decide that they want to do that instead of buying a business.

So, you know, to me as a consultant, as a somebody that's always been on helping people arrive at the right decision. If you're going through this pro 'cause I'll tell you what, like even with us bringing direct hit deals in front of you, it is so hard. You are [00:46:00] gonna have to defend yourself to a bunch of lenders.

You're gonna have to deal with the broker things. You're gonna have to get the owner off the ledge when they wanna get out of it. You're gonna have to project manage all of this. You're gonna have to track hundreds of pieces of documentation. Mm-hmm. You're gonna have to give the same thing to the bank five times, even though they already asked for it.

Like, I'll tell you what, this is a good training ground for whether business ownership is for you. Um, and, and you know, I guess the other thing is most people don't have the patience and the resilience to, to see it through. So if you're looking to close on a business in the next three months, and you've just started this and you've never done this before, extend your timeline significantly.

Because even with our support, this can take time. I had a client, um, we were under LOI, it took 12 months for them to close. And that was no, like the nothing to do with us, right? One of the partners, there was a lawsuit, there was all these things that happened, like after [00:47:00] LOI, it was like, it was still a good business.

They bought the business, but there's things that just come up and, and some people won't, won't hang in there that long to see it through. I'd also love for everyone's first LOI to be the business that they buy, but the whole point of doing due diligence is to uncover things that maybe make it not a good decision.

So a hundred percent of our clients have gotten undersigned, LOI, that's within our control to put businesses in front of them that they like out of our control to negotiate it. But we're we're really good at getting them to negotiate it. What happens afterwards is. Them kind of driving it forward. And a lot of 'em, a lot of what we do is try to get people out of their own way or help them decide if this is the right thing or, you know, manage their expectations on their timings.

And it's like LOI doesn't go through, are you gonna pick yourself up and keep going or not, you know? Um, I just had one of our amazing clients and he made the right decision to get out of an LOI, 'cause the broker was [00:48:00] absolute asshole. Sorry, I'm gonna cuss. Like, he was so bad and there was no way of us knowing that.

But when things got to the, the point, it's like, hey, there's some discrepancies coming up in the financials. I'm not comfortable with it. Lender's not comfortable with it. Qvs not comfortable with it. He just started threatening him and admins like, so she, the business was an amazing fit, but that guy, if he's acting like that, what else is gonna be down the track?

What is he potentially hiding? So client made the right call to get out of that and we're, you know, we're still sending searches and we're gonna go through it, but a lot of people, if the first one doesn't go through, then, then they'll out. So, um, yeah, I, I think the better question is, you know. Am I, am I like a hundred million, 10% convinced that I am going to be a good business owner and I'm, am I willing to do whatever it takes to make that happen?

And as you go through this process, you know, this theory of business ownership sounds so great. It sounds like I'll have freedom over my time and like, I, [00:49:00] I don't, you know, I'm lucky if I get to spend time with my boyfriend in the evening 'cause I'm like working, you know, that's what happens. So, and those owner hours that they're listing, like, you're gonna have to double that mm-hmm.

To catch up to where the owner was. So, you know, it's just not for everybody, but we're really, really, really amazing at putting good foot deals in front of people. Um, and, and that's what we rate ourselves on. Like, if people aren't moving on the deals and not taking those owner calls and going on those dates and making those proposals, then we, we have something wrong on the front end.

Mm-hmm. 

**Austin:** Yeah. And I would, I would also add that there, I don't care how good the sim looks, I don't care how great their financials look. There is error on every deal and everyone has a different risk profile in terms of what they're comfortable with. But like, this is the world of small business. And like you, people do crazy things when it comes time to sign a seven figure personal guarantee, you know?

And like, I completely get where that comes from. But like, you need to be committed to this process and committed [00:50:00] to finding success when we do put quality opportunities in front of you. So, um, the next one, Athena, go ahead. 

**Athena:** Well, I was just gonna say like, people do, they do wild things as we go through this process too, you know?

So, um, you're gonna find out a lot about yourself when you go through this and, and is that really a, a loss to be like, you know what, actually a W2 I've been, say, I've been joking this for years. Like having a W2 is like being on vacation. You don't have to worry where that money's coming from. It's hitting your bank account every month.

You know, you can kind of like check out and like do some other things while you're, you don't have to worry where the money's coming from or if somebody's sick, do you have to like cover their work? Or if, you know, like W2 is literally a vacation, y'all, you get benefits, you get money in your bank account.

No matter what you do, you're not gonna bankrupt yourself if you make a wrong decision. Somebody else is making all the decisions. Like that is sweet and most people are very comfortable with [00:51:00] that, that they're not willing to leave the comfort of that to go into something which is like the complete opposite.

There's no comfort in business ownership. 

**Austin:** Yeah, agreed. Well, talk to us about like maybe a, a business owner that, um, currently runs one company, but they're looking to maybe branch outside of that industry. Like how does SBA look at those transactions? 

**Athena:** So I, I have a client right now that's doing this, and it's really exciting, I think, to be a business owner and say, Hey, I think there's an opportunity here for me to increase my footprint or increase my revenue or get an extra client list or add a service that our clients have been asking for through acquisition.

Honestly, I, I'd say current business owners probably have a much higher likelihood to close than first time buyers mm-hmm. That have never been business owners. And I'll give you all this stat. I heard this from, um, [00:52:00] uh, uh, baton brokers that only 2% of people that say they want to buy a business actually do.

And I mean, I don't have the exact like, you know, research behind this to take it or leave it, but anecdotally with everyone that I've spoken to, they're like pretty accurate. Right. Um. So, oh, what was I saying just before then though? Sorry, I lost my train of thought. 'cause I love throwing those, those types of stats in, 

**Austin:** um, previous business owner that's buying outside of their vertical.

Yes. 

**Athena:** Right. So you like, you have to be a special, kind of crazy to be a business owner, to start a business. So to make that decision again, is less of questioning whether I can be a business owner. Can I stand the pressure of making the decisions, having team, having people quit on me, having bad things happen, lawsuits happen, like all that sort of thing.

So I love this if you feel like you're in a place where you know you've got a good enough kind of team that's looking after things, that it's not going to really upset your business to [00:53:00] put some time into looking, is there an opportunity for me to buy a service or another company that increases my footprint?

Um, you know, landscaping is a, a great example. You know, you own a landscaping business, you can buy some adjacent landscaping businesses and automatically you're just acquiring a customer list. There's some back office kind of savings that you'd have there. So I love first time buyers that are business owners too.

Like we would love to work with them, but we, we wanna check that your business is in an okay enough place that you're not gonna end up like killing one business by going after another. 

**Austin:** Mm-hmm. Yeah. Love that feedback. Um, I'm just scrolling through here. What about folks that don't qualify for SVA style transactions?

Or maybe we, we find a deal outside of that. Like, will we work with folks that are using like conventional mo conventional more traditional options when it comes to their, to their financing? 

**Athena:** They do have to prove to us that they have that [00:54:00] available and that there's some sort of, like, they're backing 'em up on that.

Um, conventional is pretty hard to buy, like small business transactions. That's unless you are a current business owner and you have a really good relationship with the bank, but most of them aren't blanket saying like, we'll, we'll support you in this. So I'd wanna dig into a little bit more like, why aren't you able to use SBA, um, what are these relationships look like?

Like how legitimate is this alternative financing source and and how much have they actually given you confidence that they're backing you no matter what business that you find? Um, because we have to, and it's, it's mostly Luke and the analysts when they're on the phone with the brokers having to like defend the fact that we have qualified buyers.

Right? Um, so we need to qualify you before we do that. Otherwise we lose our credibility with these folks that we work with day in, day out. 

**Austin:** Yeah, I, uh, I would agree with that for sure. We are our sweet spots really like SBA style transactions and, um, yeah, using [00:55:00] Perry Passio, depending on the specific instance, if it makes sense.

So our sweet spots really, SBA, um, but if you do have additional lenders in those, uh, initial conversations I'm digging into like, what does that look like? Do you have multiple options? Like, um, have they given you a scope of work and what they're willing to, to fund from their perspective? Um, and if you've got all that lined up, fantastic.

And it's, it's definitely worth the conversation on our side and, and something we consider for sure, but the, the blocks just need to be in place, um, program fees for payment or equity. Um, Russ, I'm gonna ask this question maybe. So when we work with management companies that are looking to do like a rollup strategy or things of that nature, um, here at Asset Match, 

**Athena:** um, so.

Because of the, the positioning that we have when we go out to, can you hear the dogs barking? My dogs are going crazy. I think someone's at the [00:56:00] door. 

**Austin:** No, you're good. I'm like, I can't hear it on side. 

**Athena:** Yeah. Apparently my computer has very good noise cancellations. So, um, we, we don't, uh, love the rollup or PE strategy in terms of like us representing it.

Um, it's not a good fit. It's not a good fit for our model. It's not a good fit for our messaging. So we won't just purely like hunt and source deals for people. We know great folks out there that will do that, that are probably better fits. Um, but we're, you know, we're working with. First time buyers specifically, and this was a point I was gonna make earlier, is like most people won't, most advisors don't wanna work with first time buyers that are using SBA that don't have the finances because the likelihood to close is very little.

So we're, you know, wanting to work specifically with first time buyers so we can help folks that haven't been through this before, like to become business owners if they feel like that's what they're cut out to do. Um, and our messaging when we reach out and do the on and off [00:57:00] market sourcing and, and the way that we speak to people, it's a certain client that we are representing, which is a person that wants to be a business owner and, and, and, you know, create generational wealth and, and hold that business.

So if you're doing a rollup strategy or you're wanting to like have an exit in a couple years, it's not necessarily a bad play, it's just not one that works with our model. So I would, I would recommend going to a different type of advisor to do sourcing for you. 

**Austin:** I'm gonna, I'm gonna ask this question.

I'm, I'm sad that Juan had to drop, um, with us before we got to this question, but you'll love this one. Um, can you speak about how to get a buyer comfortable with submitting an an LOI? What is the rough process? I've submitted two Lois and my experiences that buy side brokers protect the buyer is their job.

After all, I felt that they actually pushed me to submit an LOI without having enough, uh, enough info on the business or to make a, a, a quality decision. 

**Athena:** Okay. I'm [00:58:00] assuming he's meaning like the sellers brokers pushing them. Rather than the buy side 

**Austin:** broker. Yeah. My experience is that the buy side broker protect the buyer.

No, I think he's, yeah, I, I think this is what we were maybe talking about ahead of our call in the sense of like, a buy side broker is heavily incentivized based on a percentage of the deal to like push them into, to closing, um, on the transaction. So like they'll push them to submit Lois whether the deal is actually a good fit for them or not.

Um, and maybe you can expand on that a bit, um, 'cause I know you're a bit more eloquent in terms of how you'd explain that. 

**Athena:** Eloquent. And, uh, as Austin says, one of my famous rants about this, right, like, you've gotta, you've gotta question incentives. So if somebody is incentivized only when you close and they're incentivized by how much money you pay, what do you think they're going to do?

They're gonna push you to close and pay as much money as possible so they get paid. Our model is more [00:59:00] money upfront. You gotta be sure that this is what you're gonna do, but then our incentives are aligned and we want you to get the best price and move on the business that's gonna be a good fit for you.

So I don't love that. Right? And I think, I think there's this whole broken process in business buying on the, on the buy side and the sell side where we're motivated based on the percentage of the deal size and the, the structure that they have is only when they close and then brokers start losing their.

I'm, I'm gonna cuss 'cause whatever. It's my webinar. They start losing their shit when they, when the, they fear that the deal's not gonna close or make as much money as they thought initially. But imagine that sell side broker was on a flat fee and the buyer comes back and is like, Hey, there's some discrepancies here.

Um, in the finances, it's not gonna get through. SBA, can we work something out to make this work? That broker, if they were making the same amount of money, whether it was, you know, a hundred thousand less or more on the purchase price, would be more amenable to just getting the deal done and helping that seller through the process.

So [01:00:00] I, it pisses me off, you know, and, and. I have met a lot of shady brokers. We have a extensive blacklist. You know, the team will not engage with certain brokers after we see how their, their shady dealings, how they deal with our clients, how they deal with their clients, like mm-hmm the backwards stuff that they do to be able to like double dip on fees.

It pisses me off. Um, and like, you can't read it, but my necklace says savage. Like, I am sweet, but I'm also mama bear. And if I'm protecting my clients and I want them to have the best experience, then people doing this out of integrity BS pisses me off. Um, so yeah, we won't push you on things and we will honestly ha most of the time I'm playing devil's advocate.

If somebody's running after a deal. We're really stress testing with them and like, okay, why this business though? Why are you the right fit for this business? Like, beyond it just being exciting about the numbers, what else about it is going to [01:01:00] excite you? Because the numbers will probably drop. You're probably looking at a J curve your first two years.

Mm-hmm. Or they won't grow, right? So what excites you and why are you a good fit for this business? So, yeah, I, I hate that kind of advisory and it's, it's another reason why we don't act as brokers, right? Because then, then we can have the right incentives aligned with our clients and, and if they feel like it's not a good fit or they realize business ownership isn't for them, it's like, okay, like, you know, best only you know what you're able to do and we can guide you and be that, that lens and hold up the mirror.

Um, but I'm not gonna push you. I mean, I, I, hang on, I'll push at the, when I see you self-sabotaging and getting outta your own way, I do push. Right? But if we both agree like, Hey, this doesn't feel like a good fit, then it's like, okay, let's, let's start looking at other things. What did we learn from this?

And, you know, we, we will analyze like, well, what about that? Did we like, did we not? Like, what should we take going [01:02:00] forward as a learning? Mm-hmm. 

**Austin:** Yeah. And even I'll, I'll add to that Athena, and like, even in our sales process, like I'll push back and tell you like, Hey, he, here are the risks associated with moving forward with us?

Like, this is not a risk free engagement, right? We, like, there are things maybe on an individual level or on a macro level when it gets into like ever changing sba a guidelines, et cetera, et cetera, that like you need to consider prior to moving forward and, and taking on, uh, taking on a, a service like ours, you know?

So. Um, I'm surprised this hasn't been asked. We're kind of through our, our questions in the chat here. If anybody, if I missed anyone's or anyone wants to throw additional questions in there, feel free. Um, one we got from the webinar, and I'm surprised it hasn't come up today, is, uh, talk to me about geography.

Like how do you handle, um, geography, like folks maybe looking, um, in like a specific region of the United States that we're not located in, or maybe they're only looking in commuting distance within, um, uh, within their [01:03:00] homes. So I, I guess that's kind of two questions is like, how do we work in, in markets that aren't the one that we're based in?

And then the second would be how do we work with geographic restrictions as well? 

**Athena:** Yeah. Um, it's a great question. Most people like where they live and they don't wanna move. And if, if that's the case, then um. We can work with geographic restrictions, provided the market is big enough, so we'll, we'll kind of assess like what, where's the market?

Do we have any clients there? We don't put clients in competitive situations, so you might be in a competitive situ, like if we put a non-market deal in front of you, obviously it's gonna be competitive, but we won't put that deal in front of the same two clients. So if we take on a client, then they have that, that particular area, unless the deal boxes are completely different or there's a lot of density there.

Like these bigger markets like Dallas, you know that there's tons of stuff there. Mm-hmm. You still need to manage your expectations on how long [01:04:00] this is going to take. So, you know, Austin is really good about this. Like if you're restricted on geo and you're like, I don't wanna go more than 45 minutes away from my house.

You just need to extend your timeline of how long your search process is going to take. It's not that it can't happen, it's just that it can take longer because we have a very limited area in which those businesses come up for sale, whether it's on market or off market. We're not magicians. We can't make it come out of thin air.

We have to work with the available inventory of businesses that fit your criteria, that are profitable, that are ready to sell, that are in your area. Right? It's, it's like that six foot four blonde, blue eyed finance trust fund, right? Like they're out there, but like finding one and then, and then marrying one, like even, even more limited, um.

So, uh, so we can work with geo, but just we will tell you during this process, like it might just take [01:05:00] longer if you're gonna be super restrictive on Geo. Mm-hmm. But my gosh, the, the ways you can open up deal flow so much quicker is being open to different markets. You know, and this is where you can wave a magic wand and have fun with it.

Like, I know you live where you live now, but are there any other areas in the country that you've thought about living and you'd be like, gosh, that would be so mm-hmm. To live there. So we do have a lot of clients that pick markets that are like their dream markets that they would love to mm-hmm. Live in, that we can search in.

And that just increases the deal flow that we can put in front of 'em because they're open to that. But even in that process, again, we're calibrating and assessing whether the, the, the, yeah, I could move there. And then under the hood on a deal, you find out whether you're really willing to move there or not.

Um, so yeah, 

**Austin:** I'll, uh. I'll throw this one out as well. Athena, I'm, I'm kind of, of the opinion that this is like really our secret sauce and like what we've spent, um, a lot of time really developing. But like, when you talk on market [01:06:00] opportunities, like where do you mean specifically? Are you sourcing from sites like Biz Buy, sell, um, like maybe give us a bit more color in terms of like, on market and, and how you're, you're going out and identifying those deals.

**Athena:** Yeah. Um, it's, uh, so like I said, we have like over a hundred on market sources, but we look at the biz buy sells and all the main platforms too. That tends to be a place where brokers list the most. We've got a lot of broker relationships and markets that we've been active in. And then when we also go into a market, we'll start, um, uh, into a market where we don't have those relationships.

We will look at everything that's listed, but also do an aggressive relationship building strategy when we go into a market. Mm-hmm. Um, and let them know, you know, buyer profiles and that sort of thing. So. And then in addition to that, the team, uh, that we have, we have a whole team that actually like researched this in addition to just looking at the listing sites.

Um, and they'll go and find [01:07:00] opportunities also. So it might even be more than a hundred on market sources now. Um, and so the team will look at all those. The reason why we look at the, the biz buy, sell and, and you know, the major platforms is because brokers are not marketers, right? So most people, when they're doing their own search, they, they have very limited times.

So they're gonna eliminate things that are like, ah, that looks like crap. That's a bad listing, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. But we have a whole team, right? We have a whole research team that's like going through this process of vetting. So we will go down the line on things a lot further than most people will and uncover hidden gems like.

Brokers are not marketers. They don't know how to write compelling copy. Oftentimes they're real estate agents that actually dunno business brokering or they're pulling out mm-hmm. The details that aren't really that important to you as a first time individual buyer. So the team's teasing that out throughout that.

So, um, you know, don't discount the major platforms [01:08:00] because that's where the brokers go when they list things. But we, we get incoming deal flow from brokers now too, because we're creating such a, a name for ourselves in that community. Brokers reach out to us and I, I remember I was at this, um, the, uh, Texas Association, a business brokers annual meetup and, um, live Oak was, you know, the brokers are all saying there's no quality, no qualified buyers out there.

And the lenders are like, there's more than enough qualified buyers. They're like, you should go speak to Athena. So I had all the brokers coming up to me like, I heard you have qualified buyers. And I was like, I do. What kind do you want? You know, so. They come to us now 'cause they know the process that we go through to vet someone, pre-qualify them and everything.

So we're getting that inbound on market deal flow also where there's an intermediary in the mix. 

**Austin:** Mm-hmm. Absolutely. Um, I'll throw out this last one. I think we're through the, the calls or the questions in our chat today. And I've got a, a hard stop at uh, 30 here. [01:09:00] Um, talk to me about, uh, benefits of, um, doing this as a W2 employee leveraging a service like ours, um, as opposed to, uh, putting, going all in and doing this full-time as, uh, an individual.

Um, and maybe like dig into that a bit further outside of like simply the, the opportunity costs associated with lost wages, but like maybe some of the other more nuanced things that they get with working with our phenomenal team. 

**Athena:** Yeah. Um. Look, as a business owner, you're gonna have limited time to do things, you know, so you need to make the best decisions of like where your time should be spent and you outsource and hire people that are that, that do things that aren't necessarily good fit for your time.

So if you're genuinely. Wanting to be a business owner. You're in a W2, you have a mortgage, you have kids, you know, like you have, or you just don't wanna lose that income while you do this. Then outsourcing to somebody [01:10:00] that's taking that, scanning all the listings, speaking to brokers, weeding out the crap, you know, and putting things on your table where it's a better use of your time to review a deal.

I like this. I'm gonna go speak to the broker owner. Put an offer on it. Right? So we're eliminating that kind of earlier on, crappy admin work. Although I, I say crappy loves what she does, she remembers every NBA she signs and whether she got the sim for it and whether it turned into a writeup. So like our team love that stuff.

They love scanning the listings, they love hunting. I would guess that 99% of you that are doing your search do not love that part, right? So as a business owner, I wanna hire people that love that stuff because they're probably gonna do it way better than I would with my limited time. So when your time is limited, you wanna make sure that you're spending it on the right things and deals that are, you know, have been vetted through that whole process by a team that have looked at it before it gets to you more likely for you to actually [01:11:00] close.

And it shortens your overall timeline of, of, you know, searching and finding a business. Mm-hmm. Most people, when they start this out and they do it on their own. You're gonna have to learn, right? Like, how do you set up a CRM to track all of this? Like we, we are scanning tens of thousands of listings a month just on market, reaching out to thousands of business owners.

So you're gonna have to build something to track all that, stay on top of it. All the messaging, like how you actually get through to people. Like we, you know, like the volume of what we process. I couldn't imagine somebody actually being able to set something like that up by themselves in a timely manner.

Um, and all the subscriptions and costs and tech and everything that you need to be able to do it. So I just don't think it's a good use of someone's time unless you think I'm gonna do this forever, you know? And that's kind of as a business owner when it's like, right? Mm-hmm. There's, there's a skill that I need in [01:12:00] my business.

Is this something that I learn as a business owner? Is this something that I see myself doing in the future? Or do I hire somebody that's good at it? I learn enough to be dangerous so I can manage that person, right? Some outcomes in terms of what I want. So you can start thinking like a business owner earlier on, and then you're in your W2, so you're not losing your income.

Yeah, you're gonna make a big investment working with someone like us, but the worst case scenario is you figure out business ownership isn't for you. And you still have your, your vacation W2, you know, like you quit, like Will was sitting on the webinar, you quit, you lose your income, you're like, you know, uh, chipping away at your nest egg and you're gonna have to find yourself a job right now.

And I can tell you one thing, like the job market is so insane because, you know, there's AI disruption, there's a lot of like off market, uh, or not. Um, uh. Outsourcing in other countries, like amazing talent out there that will work for a [01:13:00] fraction of the cost that Americans will and they'll have a much better attitude around it.

So you don't wanna be trying to find a job right now. It is tough. We post a listing, we get 2000 applications for somebody to, to work for us. You know, so like not only is it the opportunity cost of you're losing your salary, you're chipping away at your nest egg, but you're, you're losing your cushy vacation W2 that you might not be able to get another one for two years down the line, right?

Mm-hmm. When AI is taken even better and people have learned how to harness that and they get better at sourcing, you know, offshore, like, unless you are a specialist that is in high demand, like, man, that's a risk I wouldn't wanna take either. 

**Austin:** I, I'd also add that like a, a lot of folks that we talk to, they're looking at et what ETA as a way to de-risk entrepreneurship, right?

And like, avoid going zero to one. And it's like, you're gonna quit your job and not take a salary for an entire year while you [01:14:00] focus on this full time. Like almost defeats the purpose of like the, all of the benefits that you get from leveraging the ETA model. You know what I mean? So, um, yeah, couldn't agree more.

Um, in terms of, uh, what you're saying, and I'll, I'll riff on that maybe a even a bit further is the skillset, right? It's like, how are you evaluating those transactions? Like our team does this all day, every day, and I can tell you, um, how unbelievably skilled they are at being able to identify like. Both risks with that specific business that you may have missed, as well as like areas for growth and looking at this in, on both of a, from a micro and a macro perspective.

So, um, I'd also add like, there is a skill involved in evaluating transactions and when you talk about going out and signing a multimillion dollar personal guarantee, like the name of the game is, how do we limit risk? Right? And you need somebody on your team to, to help you see around some corners and identify some things that you may not have thought of.

So, um, I think that's all we have for the moment. Um, Athena, [01:15:00] any, uh, any closing thoughts from your side that you'd, you'd love to share with us or, uh, yeah, I guess I'll, I'll let you wrap it up from here. 

**Athena:** No, that was super fun. Um, like, uh, just blown away that people wanted to come and ask some questions and find out more about what we wanna do.

So that's fun. I hope it was useful for folks. And look, we've got, if you go under our website, there's resources there, there's webinars. For you to be able to, you know, there's one on there that's like, should you buy a business? And it's a good one to go through to figure out like, is this really the move for you?

Right? Like, and I'm gonna, I'm gonna, they called me the dream killer for a long time. 'cause I'm gonna kill your dreams about what the Internet's selling you about this opportunity. But for some people that will be even more motivating. So you can go there, they're free, like lots of resources there, um, that can fill your time and, uh, educate you while you're waiting to speak to Austin too.

And, you know, if, if you do this on your own, like by all means, like go and do it [01:16:00] too. I want everybody to have access to this opportunity, but just know it's, it's fraught with a whole bunch of challenges and it is still, there's no way to de-risk it entirely, right? Like the, the component is you as a business owner.

So what are you doing to get yourself ready for business ownership? Um. I just saw a question about sending the recording. I think, I think we can do that. Anka can get the recording up and send it to everybody too. Um, but yeah, this was a lot of fun and um, you know, thanks for everybody's interest and, uh, you know, we will, we'll keep doing these in the future and future webinars or if there's any topics in particular that you all are interested in learning more about.

Like, I don't wanna do a sales pitch, but if there's aspects of what we do that could be helpful for you or how to assess whether I'd be a good business owner or what psychological things or, you know, things should I start working on to get ready for business ownership. I'm happy to host more webinars 'cause I, I do know we have a pretty extensive wait list.

Like we're pushed out to almost [01:17:00] October now for a start. Whatever we can do to help y'all in the meantime, in your search, like, we'd be happy to do that. So feel free to respond to the email I sent you to tell you about this or get in touch with Austin and say like, Hey, we'd love to learn about this. I'm, I'm happy to host more of these to kind of tide you over in the meantime.

So, and thank you Austin for, uh, expertly guiding us through the questions. That was really helpful. Probably more fun than watching me, like, you know, my forehead read the, the questions as they came through 

**Austin:** the, uh, yeah, en enjoy the Athena. Uh, thanks everybody for hopping on with us and uh, again, as Athena mentioned, reach out to us, uh, respond to your invite.

Let us know if there's anything you'd like to see and we can, we can work on some webinars in the future. So, um, absolutely. 

**Athena:** Yeah. Thank you so much everyone. Thank you Austin. Thanks to my team for taking time out of their day, their excitement of sourcing deals to be here and show you some of the amazing people we have Aren in the scenes making this happen.

So, um, [01:18:00] hope to, uh, see more of you again in the future.
