# New Client Orientation Call

[00:00:00] 

**Athena:** Well, welcome to a new client orientation. We've already done our intros. What we're gonna be covering today is just a really quick reminder of what the market is for, self-funded searchers, and kind of what you're up against.

Then we'll talk about getting the right buyer mindset. I, I don't think we talk about this enough, and it's something that, you know, we we're really big on is not only helping you find good businesses, but getting ready for ownership, um, and how to become the right buyer. So, even though we can put deals in front of you, there's a lot of work on your end to be the reciprocal partner to us to get into, get enough experience to become the right buyer.

We're gonna be talking about getting your write-up switches, your actual deals, getting the most out of us, and then time for questions at the end. So. The market for self-funded searchers. Uh, as you know, there's a lot of people hyping this up on the internet right now about how it can be this amazing cash flowing thing and you can buy a business and go sit on a beach, and [00:01:00] we know none of that is true.

However, this is what you're up against. There's more and more and more people coming to the market every single day. On top of that, there's a whole bunch of people that know what they're doing that are buying businesses and all the people that are first timers or have never done this. So, you know, we're up against private equity, we're up against, uh, strategic buyers.

We're up against other search firms. Um, there's a lot going on. There's a lot of competition. So. Knowing that what we do is essentially put you at the final table and whisper in your ear, but you still have to play, right? You have to get that experience to be able to win the overall tournament. Um, so as you know or should know, there are more buyers and sellers, so that makes it a seller's market.

So businesses are priced accordingly. Um, so it's pretty much like whoever will pay the top price valuations the way that they used to be, are not done, um, that [00:02:00] way anymore because there's so many people that don't have the sophistication to know how to look at this that are making big offers. Um, I already mentioned this.

You're competing with search funds, experienced investors, advisors, and other searchers. So even though we put things in front of you, you still will have to play competitively and we'll teach you how to do that. Another thing to really bear in mind is that time kills all deals. So you'll remember from your agreement.

We do ask for 24 hour responses. It's not to be pedantic. Uh, it's because that's what helps you actually win and stay in it. . Um. Also, if you're, you know, most people who are doing this unassisted takes two to four years. We're shortening that time gap. But also, just bear in mind that once you get under LOI, it's still gonna be three to six months to close.

So that time kills all deals. It's keeping momentum, keeping on top of things. I'm gonna talk about some times in a minute. Um, so, you know, and I've, I've talked about this a lot. You might be the [00:03:00] right owner of the business, but you're gonna lose if you're not the right buyer.

That's what we're here to help you become, is the right buyer. This is, you know, buying multimillion dollar assets and there's a lot of other players in the game, and we're here to help you. The 2% of people who say they wanna buy a business, who are the right owners of those businesses, become the right buyers.

And if you haven't heard this stat before, pretty much only 2% of people that say they want to do this. Actually do buy a business. So there's a whole bunch of intention, not a whole bunch of execution. So we're here to help you execute on that. In order to do that, we need to get you into the right buyer mindset.

Now, being a business owner is like participating in an Iron Man. And going through this process is training for that Iron Man. And this is essentially all of us when we start our search, right? You can't just jump into an [00:04:00] Iron Man. We're out of shape. We've never done anything like this before. It's training and we have to train.

And the more that we train, the better we become. So I like to think of business ownership as an Ironman Rice, because once you're the owner, there is no real time off. We can take time off, but you know, if our business fails, it's like we're the ones that have to pay the bills. So you're essentially at day one of training for an Ironman, every deal is an opportunity to have a training session, right?

So I want you to think of every deal as an opportunity to do a training session. 'cause it's not just, is this deal a good business? It's an opportunity for you to get training because every deal is practice tell. It's not. Right. So we have to practice. We have to train because the one when it comes, we don't know when that is going to be, but you wanna be ready for it.

You wanna be trained for when you have that opportunity to [00:05:00] actually get an entry into the race. So, you know, strap in for this process. Even with us, you're gonna hear no, you're gonna be ignored. You're gonna ask, be asked to prove yourself repeatedly. You're gonna have to work under pressure and you will find weird and wonderful things to hold yourself back during this process because it is absolutely terrifying to push millions of dollars into the middle of the table all at once.

It's essentially what you're doing. You're making a multimillion dollar bet on yourself. That can bring up a lot of questions of am I capable? So you will do interesting things as you go through this process that you will justify as the right thing to do. But they're often fear-based. So we're here to help you kind of work through that.

But it's better I think to mentally prepare for that. If you give up, you lose. Right? That's the only way you lose in this game up until business ownership and failure, [00:06:00] right? But if you give up, you lose. So after you get under LOI, it is. Often the case that it could fall apart. You'll uncover things that make you feel like you don't want to move forward.

And rather than letting that be the thing that stops you from getting up and doing it again, view it as something that's potentially saving you bankruptcy and a learning experience, right? So most of the clients that don't make it through to business ownership, so the ones that don't pick themselves up after the first letdown, and it sucks.

I've been there. I have had the biggest letdown I can in my entire life and career on a deal of falling apart. But you gotta pick yourself back up again. This process takes time, right? And you wouldn't jump into the Ironman without training. So it is unlikely that the first couple deals that come in front of you are gonna be the one.

It's happened before, but man, you're gonna be running the Ironman untrained. So view this as your training. This is a process. You've gotta train for the marathon. And the more you take swings, the [00:07:00] more you're gonna be ready for the one. So we're gonna talk through what we say is best practice, but we want you to take every deal as far as possible so that you're getting that training in.

And challenges are to be expected for literally every single business. There is hair on every single business, but it's all about how we can mitigate that. So really honing your resilience, your growth mindset, and your perseverance is how you're going to win. And man, it sucks so bad when a deal you really liked falls apart or somebody else gets the offer when you didn't.

The way you're gonna win in this game is just to pick yourself up and keep going, right? So this is a phrase that somebody told me when I was a searcher early on, and oh my gosh, it has helped me so much. I have it on a post-it note in front of my desk because it's relevant everywhere. The closer you are to getting the thing that you want, the [00:08:00] harder it gets.

So if it's getting hard, then it, it means you're close, right? Because anything worth having, especially multi-millions of dollars of generational wealth over a decade, is not going to be easy to come by. So it's not to be said that you should be pushing something that's just not a good fit, but if it's feeling hard.

This is a reframe I like to use. I'm probably in the right place, right? Like building things, growing things, doing things that nobody else is doing. Buying businesses and making multimillion dollar acquisitions. It's hard, but the harder it gets, the closer you are. Um, okay, so that's, that's the mindset woowoo stuff over for the moment.

But you've met most of your team. We have some other folks, uh, behind the scenes that also work with us. And on, um, your deals. I wanted you to meet the majority of the team today, but we have David and Mosam who are even at the more front end [00:09:00] ahead of Ray that are, um, finding those deals, sorting those deals, uh, doing the deal hunting, creating the leads, doing the outreach.

Um, so there's a whole heck of a lot of work before it even gets to Ray. I'll show you what that looks like. Austin, you've all met. And then we've got Minnie also behind the scenes helping with the operations. So, um. All of our team, everyone here cares about you. We're all bought in to helping you become business owners because that's what excites us.

We like seeing the life changing aspects of what this process can be. So remember that everyone here is in your corner. Everyone here wants you to win, and everything that we are doing is trying to be in service of that. That's one of the coolest things about hi, hiring an advisor on your side and hiring us is because we want you to win and we wanna help you get that life vision that you all started picturing and when you were setting the destination and the reason why business ownership is so [00:10:00] important to you.

Oh my gosh, I keep doing that. Exit on this button. Let's see. Alright, so let's talk about how to become the right buyer. This is hard, right? Because business ownership is one of the hardest things that you will ever do in your entire life, and you're basically getting a crash course in mergers and acquisitions.

You're learning how to become a business owner at the same time as learning acquisitions. And acquisitions are so complicated in so many ways. The things you have to look at, the modeling, how you're explaining things to lenders, what lenders are looking at, what the brokers are doing, going through QV, all of this stuff is things that the business owner of the business, you were trying to bri buy is over their head and they've probably never done it, right?

So you're, you're having to acquire two skill sets. One, the skillset to prove to the lender that you can take over from the owner. And two, the skillset to prove to the lender that you know, how all the modeling and all the risk and [00:11:00] everything else works, right? So you're learning two very complicated skill sets all at once.

I, I really cannot emphasize this enough. You know, people go to school for this for years. People have decades of experience working in acquisitions. Um, most of you, you know, have some sort of, you know, real estate experience, et cetera, but like buying a business is very complicated and there's a lot of nuance to it.

And while we can tee you up and help you through it, the more that you educate yourself and do some practice on your side, the more confident you're gonna feel in your decision, right? So I really want you to spend as much time learning the game as you can. We've got, uh, the buyers Club resources on your dashboard, which I'm gonna show you again in a minute.

But start binging the start with the expert sessions. They are all people that we've brought in to teach on specific things that are always a challenge for people or things [00:12:00] that they wanna learn throughout this process. You cannot practice the financial modeling enough. Um, it is something we're gonna be doing in Buyer's Club tomorrow where there's teams putting some p and ls that I've never seen before in front of me, and I'm gonna be showing you all on that session how I import it into the model, how I think about structuring, um.

Having an open mind through this process, so I know everybody kind of goes out, educates themselves, listens to acquiring minds, listens to buy them, build all of those things, and we can end up being so scared about making the wrong decision, or we heard something in a podcast or we heard this isn't the right way.

Having an open mind when we put something in front of you and push you to have that call, speak to the owner, try this out. Remember, we're all here in service of you, and if we're asking you to do something, it's because there's a skillset to be learned or there's something maybe that we're seeing that you're not.

We've gotten to know you all very [00:13:00] well. We've done this a lot of times. So having an open mind and seeing this as an opportunity to try out things and learn things actually gets you there a lot quicker. Rather than shutting down and like, oh, I saw this thing and I heard this on this one podcast, that that was a bad thing.

Every business is completely different. You are completely unique people. So even though it might have not worked for someone else, it might be something that, that we think you can, um, you know, do well at. So until you are signing commitments, letters with the banks or paying your deal team advisors, well really the only risk up to that point is that you learn something and maybe that you spend time doing it, but I don't see that as sunk cost if you're learning, if you're getting experience.

Right. So we're gonna ask you to get on broker calls. We're gonna ask you to get on owner calls. We're gonna ask you to submit Lois. That's all non-binding. There is [00:14:00] no actual cost to that. And the risk, like I said, is that you will learn something in the process, right? But until you actually have to start paying money or signing things that it's basically like, okay, I'm getting married to this bank and I'm signing on the dotted line.

Um, there's, there's not a lot of risks. So that's why I want you to kind of keep an open mind and, and see every option, every opportunity as a learning experience. There is something that happens where we get used to corporate time when we work in corporate environments that is very different from deal time, right?

And especially when all of you likely have other things that you're working on throughout the day, have to think of the difference between corporate time and deal time. Time tells all deals. So while, you know, in corporate settings or in other settings. It might take a week or two to get back to someone.

Deal. Time doesn't react that way. So especially when there's so many other buyers and competition in the market, and the [00:15:00] brokers will intentionally be guarded about, you know, they'll be like, yeah, I'll let you know if another offer comes in. They won't. Right. So we need you to move quickly and think like, alright, I need to move as quick as possible, even though it feels different than what I'm used to.

Because corporate time is very different than deal time. So if you can, when the team tells you like, Hey, there's a writeup ready. We need you to sign an NDA. We need you to do that as quick as possible. Review that writeup within 24 hours so that we can make an introduction for you to get on the broker and owner calls, and also timeliness and response to them within 24 hours.

Gives them confidence that you're moving forward. You're not at tire kicker. Um, and I would recommend that you time block in your calendar every single day for deal time, whether it's reviewing the deals we put in front of you, whether it's practicing the models, whether it's doing, you know, reviews on buyer's club calls if you're waiting for a [00:16:00] deal.

But if you get into the habit of having specific time every day and time during the day that you can schedule call with brokers, then you're keeping that momentum and you're keeping time open. So it's not just another thing that you try to wedge into your schedule when it comes up. And then we're gonna ask you to move forward on every deal, uh, that we put in, in front of you.

Um. I don't know why it says until you, sorry. So, um, when we put a writeup in front of you, we want you to move forward on it and tell, oh, that should say until you've spoken to the owner. Because there is gold in having those conversations with the broker and the owner every time you're learning something.

Um, and often the brokers will not give you the color that an owner will when you have that conversation. Brokers are pretty bad representatives, so. Getting your reps in means speaking to as many brokers and owners as [00:17:00] possible. I would really like to see you all use the financial model for every deal that we put in front of you, because first it's gonna take you a couple hours to fill it in, right?

Now our clients that have been at it for a while can do it in 15 minutes and be able to make a call on the finances of a business, whether it works for them or not very quickly. So if you use every deal we put in front of you to use as a practice session, then when, when the one comes, you're gonna be very quick to act.

Um, the clients that, uh, are doing the best and moving forward the best come to every single buyer's club call. They're every Tuesday and Thursday at 3:00 PM Central. Um, you don't have to make everyone we record it, but the ones that come kind of have that regular reminder showing up and having momentum.

Um, like, like I said, do not eliminate a deal until you've tried to speak to the owner. And that in its skill is itself. Um, I'm gonna talk about brokers in a second, but oftentimes you're [00:18:00] gate kept from the owner. So getting access to the owner in itself is a skill. You are gonna make assumptions when you read a sim, when you listen to the broker calls, when you review the writeup that the team puts in front of you, you're gonna make assumptions about that business and it's normal and it's natural.

But what we want you to do is actually verify those assumptions. So if you're like, oh, sounds like the owner is working 50 hours a week and never able to get away, it's like, okay, cool. Well get to the point. You can ask the owner like, Hey, do you ever take vacation? So when you make those assumptions, they can be dangerous because you can eliminate a deal that would've otherwise been amazing for you.

In my own experience, the deal that I raised 3,000,004 in five days. Was a deal that two of my investors had passed on because they didn't take the opportunity to speak to the broker and the owner. And that's where I discovered the real gold. Because brokers are [00:19:00] not marketers, a lot of times they don't even understand business.

So they're pulling out things that aren't necessarily relevant or highlighting things that look like it's an issue. And until you actually have those conversations, you don't know what, what the real story is. And then picturing yourself in the business. So like, is this a business I see myself in? Do I see myself getting excited about it?

You know, beyond the numbers and we're gonna stress test you throughout this. If the only thing that you're telling us is, well the numbers look really good, we're gonna be like, okay. But remember, like when you were talking about that thing that got you really excited in our first onboarding sessions, we're looking for that kind of excitement, right?

There should be aspects or elements of the business that get you excited so that you can get out of bed every day. So. SI know you all have heard my story about raising 3 million for that deal. The thing, it totally like shattered all of my, my deal box [00:20:00] assumptions. I was not looking in Dallas, you know, I, I only wanted to look in Austin and I wanted to stay in Austin.

Um, I also was not looking at property management, had no interest in it. And then I had a friend that challenged me and, and was like, widen your deal box. Look at more deals, um, look in more areas. And I was like, okay. Then when I found this business, I was like, I was literally born to do this business. The aspects of it that really spoke to me were the relationship driven aspects of it.

It was a con white glove concierge style way that they serve as their clients. And it was a low CapEx model that I could have taken in, replicated and made it a hundred million dollars business in the course of a couple years with my background in, in, you know, franchising and licensing. So I was like, I will move heaven and earth.

I will move to Dallas to run this business because I know it's not a forever thing. And that changed. [00:21:00] A lot for me because I was like, I was being so narrow and thinking I needed to stay in this location, but the right business that has the characteristics that get you that excited that you would raise 3,000,005 days over a holiday weekend and drive out to Dallas on the drop of a hat to go meet the owners and all of those things.

It felt different because I saw myself in that business. I still do. It's the one that got away. I check the website every month, like seeing what they're up to and I was like, God, you know when you have the right business in front of you, then some of the characteristics that you think really matter don't matter because when you have that kind of generational money and and a business that lights you up, then those other things may not matter as much.

So I say this because when we're going through this calibration process with you and the deal flow is light or you're rejecting a lot of things, like open yourself up to. [00:22:00] Different things that might, characteristics in businesses can also be a, a huge match. You know? Um, if it was like apartment managed property management, I would've never, you know, but this was like high end, single family home, like property management and, and the way they did it was just so, so cool.

And I haven't seen anyone else do anything like that. Um, so I guess this is all just to say, you know, location, industry preferences, those sorts of things. If, if you're severely limited on those things and you're not seeing the deals that you like throughout the process, consider widening that or consider starting even wider to start.

You never know when you're looking at these and it's like, my God, I would do anything to have this business. Um, geography will reduce your deal flow more than anything that is, you know, we, we cannot. Create businesses that do not exist in a geography. [00:23:00] So the clients that have the best success are the ones that give us other places to look at.

Um, we will work with it, a constrained geography, but it just takes more time. Right? Um, also something that I want you to bear in mind is that if you make any large changes to your deal box in the process, and your analyst will tell you, but it can have a one to two week drag in the deals that come to you.

So just be aware, if you're making very large changes to the deal box, like completely removing a geography or completely removing a whole industry set, then the team will have to clear out what was in the pipeline for you before those new deals come. Um, so. A lot of you are probably, you know, we scanning listings or still do.

Um, we would recommend that you stop doing that. Um, it can drive you a little crazy. Um, and also I'd rather you focus your time on learning what comes next. There's literally hundreds of hours of resources on that [00:24:00] dashboard. Better spent you learning that rather than scanning the listings, the team is super comprehensive.

They've probably seen what you're looking at and they will have decided or eliminated whether they wanna move it forward. That being said, if you see something out there that you like, you can send it in Slack, the team will look into it and will let you know what the status is. Um, if you have an off market opportunity, some of you have, you know, your feelers out there in the world and you're like, Hey, I'm looking for a business to buy, and your accountant says, Hey, I know this person that's selling a business.

You are more than welcome to introduce them to us, um, and have us go through that vetting, uh, process. For you and we can give you, uh, you know, what our take is before you go back with them. It helps preserve the relationship, create a bit of distance from you if it's not a good fit, and then we can talk you through how to handle that relationship if it's someone close to you.

But there's the benefit of having us review it for you. And there's also the benefit of making sure that the money that you [00:25:00] spent with us can still go towards the deals. So if you work deals outside of us and don't use us, the banks won't let you include your fees to us in your equity injection. So you might as well use us.

Um, and if you have businesses in your area that you like, that you're just like, that's the coolest business, I wonder if they would be willing to sell. Send us the list in your channel. Like feel free to go out there and be like, I love this business. I love this business. Get us a list of businesses that you're interested in, in your area, and we'll see if we can make contact and if they'd be willing to sell.

And we don't even need to say it's you, we have a process. But this helps us to even further support you. We're gonna be reaching out to industries and businesses that we think are a good fit, but if you have ones that you like, we have been successful in the past in making contact and even having owners that are willing to discuss selling, um, when you've given us the businesses that you're interested in.

Okay, so, um, brokers, um. I, I have an affinity for 'em, even though I know [00:26:00] there's a lot of broker bashing out there and they come in all shapes and sizes. But I think the big thing to note is that most of them are from the baby boomer generation. They have different values and ways of doing business. They prefer paper and handshakes and phone calls.

Um, we go to the broker events and they're actually like high fiving each other that they still use like paper calendars. Um, in, before the internet discovered business buying, they used to get a few inquiries on a deal. Now they're getting like 200 in their first hour. They don't have CRMs, they don't have tech.

They don't have a way of tracking it. Um, so their paycheck is dependent on the buyer and choosing the right buyer. And oftentimes they have been working on this deal for sometimes years. So they will not move you forward if they don't think you are the right buyer or that you can't get it done. So.

Understanding that their paycheck, their livelihood, their mortgage payment is dependent on choosing the right buyer. That they don't have tech or a [00:27:00] system for managing the influx of all of these people. They normally will just focus on gut and their experience to choose people. So that's why it's a important for us to have you get your reps in with the brokers because they can end up being your champion.

Right? When the owner doesn't understand things like forgivable performance based notes or working capital, the broker can be that champion in your corner helping explain to the owner what that means and talk 'em off a ledge. So if you focus on empathy for what they're going through and rapport building with them throughout the process, that can serve you exceptionally well throughout it.

Um, also, they don't have any formal certification or training. There's, you know, in 11 states you have to be a real estate. Uh, broker in order to sell a business, which boggles my mind. Um, and in that training, they teach you absolutely nothing about businesses. So brokers come in all shapes and sizes.

There is no standardization. Um, [00:28:00] but they hold the deals, right? So can be good business, bad broker and will help you navigate that. But don't eliminate deals just because the broker, unless the broker's doing things that are absolutely shady and untoward, like we have a blacklist of brokers that we continue to add to.

But, you know, being like not knowing the business very well or those sorts of things are not really good reasons for eliminating deals. Okay. Um, just checking Tom really quick. Good. Okay. Getting write-ups. So your write-ups are the analysis and the culmination of the team doing a lot of work. And I actually wanna show you what that looks like so you understand how much work goes in, um, before a deal gets to you.

So you'll be looking at two to four of these a month. Typically, this is gonna be dependent on your openness and criteria and geography and also what the market is doing. So when the S-B-A-S-O-P thing got launched, there was a whole bunch of [00:29:00] reticence. The tariffs has caused a lot of indecision. When there's an election, things happen.

So, um, there is just, you know, kind of seasons and policy changes and all those sorts of things that can affect deal flow. But we're pretty good at, at getting you at least two to four per month. Um, off market deals are researched bespoke to you, and it starts bespoke to you. So it can sometimes takes months to see your first off market.

We like it that way because then you're getting experience speaking to brokers and buyers. You're getting your reps in because when you have an off market deal, you have to act as broker and buyer and better for you to have some experience with those conversations. Um, so it can take you a few weeks to also get your first writeup.

So, um, there's a whole bunch of people that do a whole bunch of things before you get a write up. So, um, Assam's team, the research team is looking at and filtering all those deals. Um, then there is a first review stage that our front end team does. When [00:30:00] it's a potential match, it's sent to another second review stage, at which point we make it ready for requesting information.

Um, then after we've requested information on a deal, it moves to a whole different, uh, piece of tech for us. Um, the RFI then sends information to brokers. This is on market, for example. This is our on market process. I should have said that at the beginning. Then Ray jumps into Chase in, right. So every deal that we are RI we're chasing, because the brokers are getting a million different inquiries.

Often they don't follow up and send after we've gotten an NDA from them. We sign an NDA, then we get a sim from them. We're reviewing that if we like it. From there, we schedule a call with the broker. Then the analysts are preparing a writeup, um, getting you to sign an NDA and submit it to the client. So there are four to five different people touching that [00:31:00] deal before you get a writeup.

Once we make, uh, an introduction to you, then it's over to you with the broker and we'll be coaching you through that journey. So. We want you to review that document as soon as possible. Because the team has spent so much time on it, you need to kind of pick up where they left off and move fast, especially if there's a lot of people that are interested in that deal.

If it's an on market deal. Um, on your first writeup, there is a document on your dashboard called Preparing for your First writeup. Um, we'll send it as a follow up as a link, but we want you to review that so you understand the steps that you're gonna need. The team will schedule a call with you on your first one.

They will help you sign an NDA and explain the writeup to you. But I wanna just talk through some of the components of a writeup real quick so you know what we're gonna be looking at when you get a deal. So the first thing [00:32:00] is the team's gonna do a Loom video walkthrough of the deal. There are nuances and things in here that are really important, and it will give you a super quick snapshot of the deal from the analyst perspective.

So I would always recommend that you watch the video first before diving in. Then there's gonna be important links. There's gonna be links to the sim and the financials, any documents that we've received so far, and this is a really cool element, but if the team gets permission from the broker or the owner, they're gonna have recorded the call and transcribed it.

So this is good both for you to listen in and be able to pick up the conversation when it was left off. But most of our clients love that they're able to learn through the analysts as well and how they ask questions and the things that they're seeing. Then there's gonna be a very top line calculation of the asking price and what the SCE is, what that makes, the [00:33:00] multiple.

Um, with your additional costs, what could you potentially make after loan payments. Now, if you haven't had a chance to look at our financial modeling template, it is much more sophisticated than this, but we just wanna give you a kind of back of the napkin read on what you might be looking to make after loan payments.

If you were to, um, offer the asking price, often the asking price is negotiable and shouldn't be offered, or you would value it differently with our help. So don't eliminate a deal just based off the asking price, because that is something that can be flexible down the line. But if it's kind of within range, and we won't put it in front of you unless it is, um.

That's kind of the all important number typically is like, what? What could I look to take home if I were to do that? Asking price. And then you can start to get an idea of where you need to adjust the purchase price. Then there's gonna be a description from the sim. There's gonna be a description on [00:34:00] why we think this business is for you.

And then there's four categories in there, why we like this business, what we see as concerns, where there are opportunities for growth in this business, and where you should get clarification. We only speak to the broker, we don't then speak to the owner. Many times brokers don't have the information to answer some of our questions.

So we will highlight the areas that we think you should get clarified early or that we weren't able to get clarified. Um, and uh. Also additional info that might be important for you about this deal as well as the next steps. So usually the team will tell you how timely it is if you need to move fast, if there's other offers, the next step in our opinion is always schedule a broker call.

So we'll make an introduction and you'll get on a call. Um, okay, let me [00:35:00] go back through this. So, from writeup to offer, the team will ask you to sign an NDA. The analyst will then give you the writeup to review. You'll notify us that you've read it and you're ready with the talk track, which is your questions that you're gonna ask to the broker.

You'll schedule and have your broker call. Then you'll feed back to us about next steps and what your questions are going to be for the owner. So we call, we call your questions, your top track for your calls. Like what's the track you're gonna follow for those calls? There's resources for all of this.

We'll guide you through it. Um, you're gonna have your owner call, then you prepare your LOI and financial modeling, and then you review with us before you send over your offer. So that's essentially, there's a lot of things that happen there. Um, this isn't like the hard and fast. Sometimes you won't be able to meet the owner.

So we'll have a strategy there. Sometimes you're gonna wanna do an in-person meeting, so that will add some additional steps, but this is generally the [00:36:00] process that you're gonna follow. Okay. We're almost there. Um, I've been talking a lot. Um. There is a whole m and a education worth of resources on your dashboard.

Please dive into them. Start learning them. You know, at the very least, you want to get an overview of what's in there. So when you need it, you can go and refer to it. There is templates, there is scripts and questions. Uh, the expert sessions are absolute gold. We've got a whole bunch of people that bought businesses as well.

We've had conversations in buyers club that like literally are not on the internet. There are process documents, so I'm just gonna take you on a tour of the resources really quick. Also, if you haven't looked at this like please spend a lot of time here. Here. Your first writeup guide is the first thing that you're gonna wanna read, so you understand what in detail will happen when your first writeup gets to you.

Then the questions for brokers is how you can start [00:37:00] preparing your talk tracks equally. Seller meeting questions, that's a list. And these are basically a ton of different questions that you are able to ask, um, of brokers and sellers, and there's a different flavor. Um, the first writeup guide is gonna tell you how to use these and how to prepare your talk tracks, and the team will work with you on that.

The expert sessions are both external experts as well as buyers. Um, there's absolute golden here, like, please try to get through every single one. It will serve you so, so well. And then there's also a bunch of, like, these are all the group sessions where we went through, so there's some interesting things in there, but I would say like, focus on this expert, expert and owners tab here.

Um, and then the other thing that you really wanna spend a lot of time with is the financial modeling template. But when you need different resources, like let's say you wanna, you know, get investors to look at your deal, there's a non circumvention [00:38:00] N-D-A-L-O-I template. This is from Barlow Williams that we co-created with them.

Um, when you're ready to do due diligence, there's a tracker in there. There's additional resources that we recommend here. Um, there is some additional information that's super useful for you. Um, when you get pre LOI, this checklist and process is like what we recommend that you should do in the lead up to LOI.

This is what we recommend that you do after LOI and we will guide you through all of this, but it helps us out. It helps you out enormously if you have like visited all these things in your familiar with it. When we go through this process, rather than us trying to teach you cold, when a deal comes up that you're really excited about, 'cause you're gonna feel like you're moving fast, but you're not gonna be moving in deal time.

So the better prepared you are, the faster that you will move, um, and the more likely that you will be able to win. But I've seen a lot of clients lose opportunities just 'cause they, they are trying to learn this cold and, and spend a [00:39:00] lot of time like figuring things out and they end up taking weeks to get back to the owners or the brokers when, you know, other people are taking days.

So the more that you get your reps in and kind of use these resources, the quicker you'll be able to move through that process. Okay. Almost there. So Buyer's club. Um. This, this was really fun for us to start setting up. It gives you a consistent time to get help with your acquisitions outside of your meetings that will be set up with your team.

Um, it helps expedite your journey with shared knowledge. You can connect with other people that are at similar stages. Um, also I always join those buyers clubs, so, uh, the team will be like, Hey, I think this is something Athena can feed back on when it comes to, like, complicated structuring, or something like that.

So then you can bring your deals and, and talk through them with me there. Um, on Buyer's Club, you can bring your deals live, uh, to review or hear other people getting their deals like talked about on Tuesdays. [00:40:00] Um, you can collaborate and learn. Um, there's learning sessions usually every Thursday with experts.

Um, and then we also will do industry updates. So when there's SOP updates, the tariff situation, et cetera, that could impact your search. We're gonna, you know, keep your finger on the pulse. So really important thing is what happens in Buyer's Club stays in buyer's Club. Um, I think that's cute. Everybody else thinks I'm a nerd.

Um, uh, y'all have signed confidentiality agreements. That was in your, um, service agreement. So every person works on re uh, unique deals. There's no overlap. We do not put, you know, similar deal or the same deal in front of multiple people, but nothing discussed in Buyer's Club could be shared outside of buyer's club.

It could break the NDAs that have been signed with these deals. And circumvention is strictly prohibited, which means if you see a deal that you like, if somebody else's and you try to go after at, uh, that will be a deal breaker with us. So, like, I [00:41:00] don't think anybody would do that, but better me say it than have, uh, confusion down the line.

So Tuesdays we meet for an hour. Thursdays we meet for an hour and a half. The team's gonna send you the invite for tomorrow. Uh, it's technically our expert session, but we're just gonna spend time on the model and performance notes specifically. Um, you're gonna have weekly calls with your team, so you'll wanna be ready to review all of your deals, have your talk tracks ready, if you're gonna be preparing for calls, um, and if you're preparing for an offer, having that resource available.

So you're gonna have a weekly call with a team where you can go through all this stuff live, but it's better if you've prepared for that call, gotten us the re you know, the things that you're working on, et cetera, so that we can make that an active working session. This will be set up when your first writeup is ready.

Um. Then in Slack, uh, we, um, please keep everything in your channel. The team has to kind of [00:42:00] chime in at different points. As you see, there's a lot of us. So, um, please don't DM anyone on the team. If you have feedback on a deal or whatever, just use your channel. It's okay. Um, using threads really helps us to Anka showed you how to do that.

Um, and then please feel free to use voice notes and screen sharing. Um, like if you're working on a model and you're like, Hey, could you guys please look at how I'm doing this? Use a screen share. Or if you just had a burger call and you don't feel like typing up your notes, like you can use it on your phone and just do a voice note to us.

But it helps us stay in touch with you and in between calls, um, and then we are gonna keep important info pinned to your channel. Gosh, there's so much that I'm going through. Okay. I think this is the last slide. Um, just some more mindset stuff. Like the people in your life, the people that care about you, they won't really understand what you're going through.

Um, and they'll be scared, right? Like hearing you talk about making a multimillion dollar acquisition with a personal [00:43:00] guarantee, people in your life that care about, you'll be like, that's scary. I don't want you to do that. They might tell you to stop or they might coach you otherwise. It's the same thing with business ownership.

And when you're starting a business, people that love you wanna keep you safe in their mind, they think it's helpful to tell you to stop something that they think that will keep you safe. Um, I'm really big and open about therapy is like an absolute like level up, especially as a business owner. There's stuff that comes up.

Um, and I've had clients that have used, successfully used a therapist through this process because there's so much on the line for you. Um, so I would highly recommend if you don't have someone to maybe consider getting someone as you go through this process. Um. You get out what you put in, right? So even though you've paid money, like there's still a lot of work on your side.

So if you put as much into this, we can respond and get you there quicker. Um, and just a reminder, we're here for your success. So if we are asking you to do something that we're pushing [00:44:00] you, it's coming from a place of wanting you to be successful, please trust us and the process, that's what you hired us for and we're so, so, so excited to help you get your business.

So this process takes time. Be patient with yourself, pick yourself back up. We're here for you. We're looking for a needle in a haystack, right? Right time, right characteristics, right location. Um, so it is a process, but we are gonna do it with you. Um, and we're gonna have a lot of fun doing it. So remember, the closer you are, the harder it gets.
