Athena Simpson (Presenter, AcquiMatch): Hello. Hello. Welcome. Welcome. Welcome. So excited for another session. We're talking pipeline mastery today. These are some expert techniques for serious SMB buyers, which we hope all of you are or will be by the end of this.

[00:02:00]
Athena Simpson (Presenter, AcquiMatch): And this has been designed as an intermediate kind of 202 session. So I see some of you are one on ones. That's totally fine. We are working on something that we can share with those of you that are brand new to this space. And you're like, What is even business buying? But hang out because I think it's important to learn some of the techniques and tools that you will need should you decide that you want to really dive into this space.

And this is designed for folks that identify as self-funded searchers. So you're looking for your own business, bringing in your own funds, maybe a small amount of investment, or maybe you're already a business owner of a small business and you're looking to acquire some businesses to roll up or have a strategic play there.

So this is aimed at folks that are likely going to be utilizing SBA funding and purchases in the 5 to 10 or, you know, max 5 million range for SBA, but you can do pari passu. We're not talking financing today, but we will do soon. So you can go above that in enterprise value also.

So let's dive in. And to answer Abdul's question: absolutely, there will be a replay. We'll send that out in an email tomorrow. And also, I can't even believe this, this template that Anca made today, but we've got some insane templates for you to be able to take away and use after this. So stick around, hang out until the end of this session. And we're going to be sharing the links to the templates I'm going to be taking you through today. So you don't even need to pay for a CRM system. You can just use our template for free, which will allow you to have a CRM system that tracks all of the deals that you are going to be analyzing and pushing.

So let's just talk really quickly why we're all here. The SMB ETA opportunity. So we're talking about entrepreneurship through acquisition of small businesses and the opportunity and why we're so excited about this space. And you'll have heard this — a lot of people on the internet are talking about it. It's a big thing. 10,000 people are retiring every single day, and this is going to be happening for the next two decades.

Now, around 19 percent of these folks are small business owners, and three quarters of those are profitable businesses, and their kids don't want to take over these businesses. And I heard a stat the other day: there's only a 30 percent success rate of handing over to the next generation. So not only does the next gen not want to take these businesses over, they're not very good at it, right? So therein lies an opportunity because not only are these businesses going to be available, but you can use government money to buy these businesses, which is insane. The government wants you to be a small business owner and they're going to help you do it. So you can put in as little as 2.5 percent of the purchase price in order to buy the business. Now that gets into some advanced structuring, which we're not talking about today, right? But at a worst case scenario, you're looking at putting in 10 percent of the purchase price in order to buy a profitable business, which is just insane.

So the government's helping you do that. So the returns are really incredible when you're buying businesses, too. So we get a lot of folks that are coming to us from real estate investing because they're just not getting the kind of returns and cash flow that they want. And also venture capital is very risky. And with this asset class, with buying businesses, you can get venture capital-like returns without the startup failure risk. So we're seeing, kind of in the deals that we're playing in, for investors an IRR in the range of 20 to 40 percent and multiple on invested capital of like five to ten. So there are really insane returns when you compare that to real estate.

Now, um, oops, hang on — tech. Here we go. Let's see if my clicker works. There we go.

The risk profile on buying businesses is fairly low when you compare it to other opportunities, assuming you are a good operator of the business — someone that is going to be good at taking over this business — and also that you are buying something that's stable, that's profitable. So there are some considerations into it, but let's assume you're buying a stable, profitable business, and you are the right person to buy that business. The risk level is fairly low on that. And we're seeing returns in the like 30 percent range, right? On average, when you compare that to real estate, which is like 15 percent, stocks even lower, bonds — who's even doing that? My savings account’s even better than that right now. And venture capital, you can get these same kind of returns, but it's entirely based on very risky scenarios where they invest in a ton of startups knowing that they are going to fail.

Now you're also getting cash flow when you're buying businesses. So you're able to put in money into a deal, and most of the deals that I see, you're putting in your investment in year one — that's usually getting paid back from the profit of the business in year one, assuming that it continues to perform as it did before you bought it. And then every year after that is just straight profit because the business is paying for the debt. So your initial return can be returned in one year. And when you're comparing that with real estate, it's pretty significant. So most of the time in real estate, you're not getting paid for much further down the line. And the other thing that hit me like a truck when I heard it — being a startup girl, myself — is why start a business when you can buy a profitable one.

So 96 percent of new businesses will not make it to year five and only 5 percent of those will make it over the million-dollar mark in revenue. So when we're looking at buying businesses that have been in existence for more than five years, some of them 10, 20, 30 years, and they're over a million in revenue, they are the top percent of the top percent of businesses in this country and the likelihood of them being around for much longer is much higher because they've made it past that kind of death point of five years. So there's a really exciting opportunity for us all to participate in.

But let me talk to you about me really quick. For those of you that don't know me, my name is Athena Simpson. I'm an acquisition matchmaker. I am also a fellow searcher. My career started as an intrapreneur in corporate: I went into large organizations and I set up new business functions and new products. So I got to try my hand at entrepreneurship with other people's money. I set up the internal agency and event licensing and franchise products for Guinness World Records, and then at two award-winning marketing agencies — B Corp in LA and Liberty in London — set up internal business functions there too.

But that was not enough for me. I wanted to start my own business and I chose food, knowing nothing about the food industry for my first startup. And I spent three and a half years and $70,000 getting my product perfect before bringing it to market. I did everything wrong in that business and also suffered at the hand of doing all of those things wrong on the first endeavor, and I didn't want other people to suffer the same. So I joined forces with the woman who started the world's largest food tech company. We partnered, we ran London Food Tech Week. We helped thousands of startups to be able to get their ideas off the ground, get investment, and then partner with large corporates. I've been a business consultant off and on for 10 years. So I've seen inside thousands of businesses of all sizes through my startup communities that I ran at Why Food and also with the Liberty.

And I taught entrepreneurship at the Texas McCombs School of Business here in Austin, Texas at the University of Texas, one of the top business schools in the country. So I love startups. I am a startup girl. I have the graveyard behind me to prove it — various, varying levels of success. So when I heard this a couple of years ago — why start a business when you can buy a profitable one? — it hit me like a ton of bricks.

And before I tell you my story, here's some of the folks that I've worked with in my career. This isn't to brag; it's just to give you a flavor of my background and the people that have sought out my advice and thought it was worth listening to me. Hopefully you do too.

But back to my story. I got obsessed with the idea of buying a business rather than starting one. I was in Austin. I was doing business consulting and was racking my head because I wasn't leveraged. I was still trading my time for money, even if I was trading my time for a lot of money. And I walked into this event where somebody said that — “Why start a business when you can buy a profitable one.” And I went deep. I was sending out mailers. I was going to the local Rotary Club and doing talks there. I was hosting events with the local alumni association. I was getting listed in the paper as a business buyer. I did everything I could to try to get my hands on a business.

And I ended up finding an $8 million opportunity in Dallas. It was a property management business and I was going to structure it with SBA financing, and it was eight million. So it ended up being what's called a pari passu — where there's a gap that's not covered by the government, so you need to come up with that money otherwise. So I basically had to raise three million dollars from investors in five days over Labor Day weekend. I did it, and I submitted my offer thinking I was sure to be in, and I ended up getting beat out by a strategic that offered the equivalent of two million dollars more on that deal.

Now I had the highest and lowest point of my career up until that point within a week of each other — being able to raise that kind of money and then losing the opportunity. Two things happened as a result of that. One, I became an absolute savage at learning all of the financial structuring tools that are available to us as individual buyers and how we can use that to be competitive in these situations where we're looking to buy a business, where there are strategics or others in the mix that have all cash, right? So there's a lot of tools that we're not really talking about. I learned all of them. I went and made a ton of relationships with private capital providers.

But the other thing that I had was the desire not to go back to business consulting. All I wanted to do was search. And now I had all these investors that had invested in my idea to take over this business that also wanted businesses. So I asked them if they would like me to run their search for them. And they said yes. And so when I was supposed to be buying a business, I ended up starting a business.

So we are AcquiMatch. We are personalized SMB search and match. We help you acquire the one. And we do that through a really extensive onboarding process where we do deal clarity sessions with you. Because what we found is that for first-time buyers or folks that are W-2s — maybe they want to become business owners — they're not directly sure how their experience translates into buying a business and what type of business that they should be buying. And there's a lot more to consider than just industry, SDE, and location.

So we spend an entire month with our clients figuring out what would be a good business for you. What would be the right business for you? And then we go out and look for it on and off market. So we are experts at this. That's what we're going to show you today — our internal system. We're going to give you templates on how you can run your own pipeline to source on- and off-market deals. So we look on and off market, and then we do expert analysis and vetting of those opportunities before we hand it over to clients so they are not spending their time sifting through the listings. They're not trying to get on owner phone calls and getting their ad backs from them or trying to explain to them what valuation is. We do all of that work. We're the ones chasing the brokers and signing the NDAs and reviewing the CIMs and doing all of that so that when we pass an opportunity over to the client, they are able to make a decision very rapidly if they would like to proceed to a call with the owner — and sometimes move to LOI within a couple of weeks.

So, happily, all of our original clients — those first investors — are under offer and very close to closing. So we have 100 percent success rate with our clients right now. I am elated about that. I told the team, I was like, “A hundred percent success rate — that's what we're doing.” It's crazy, but we've done it. And we also offer consultancy and advisory as our clients go through this process, right? So how do I financially structure this? What terms should I put in the LOI? The owner came back and needs — you know — wants this as a negotiation point; what do I do?

So, going through my own process and watching other people go through this process: it is an incredibly daunting process when you would make an amazing business owner, but you have to learn how to be a business buyer before you can be a business owner. So we kind of help people through that process. And I've got an amazing team along with me. It's not just me. Two of them are here today. Anca heads up our operations and allows us to filter through and review thousands of deals. I don't know how she does it. She's magic. And you're going to see some of her templates. And for those of you that have been on these calls before, you'll have already experienced the stuff that she's making, that you would have to have spent hours on yourself. She helps us to be able to review and process thousands of opportunities.

Ryan, our vetting director, comes to us from Empire Flippers, where he was a vetting supervisor. So in 2022 alone, he vetted and listed $80 million worth of businesses. He has a very strong background, both in brick-and-mortar and online businesses, and was an entrepreneur himself. So really lucky to have him on the team. And he's the one heading up all of our vetting and reviewing. And then Massam heads up our data and lead gen. So without clean data and stuff to start with, you end up wasting a lot of time. So it's really important, when I show you these processes I'm going to take you through, to make sure that you have clean data that you're starting with. And he also researches and finds and generates leads for us of business owners. I would love to say there's AI tools out there that work, but they don't. So we've tried them all. And we needed a Massam. And we're getting pretty good with that because we've got a client under offer on an off-market med spa. We found him and we just introduced a second, which will probably be a roll-up opportunity if that goes well. So we're really excited about that.

Okay. What are we doing today? We are going to show you our internal process. So we introduced this to you on the last webinar. We're going to be talking about the second half. So once you've identified an opportunity, then what do you do with it? How do you move it through the pipeline? How do you keep track of it? So even if you weren't in the last one, you'll be able to track on this conversation, but I do recommend that you go back to the last one so you can put it all together. And there's another amazing template in there, too, for you to be able to track.

We're going to talk about the stats and do a little reality check. That is one of my favorite things to do — manage expectations. So I don't have a mastermind to sell you. I want you to go into this fully prepared and understanding how difficult it is to be a business owner and how difficult this process is to find a business. So I love — what do they call me? — the dream killer. But I would rather kill your dreams than see you go and bankrupt yourself. So we're going to look through some reality. We're going to do some reality checks. We're going to show you the deal flow tracker that Anca built, that you're going to get access to, and how you can use that as your own personal CRM to keep track of all the deals that you're looking at.

We're going to talk through some common problems that I hear people talk about when they go through their deal sourcing process, and how to overcome those. And again, it's going to be some tough love, but I love tough love because hopefully it will inspire you to do something with it. And then at the end, we're going to set some goals and accountability for you to take action. There's nothing like some accountability to get you off the block and get you doing the things that are going to help you achieve your goal, which I hope is buying a business or getting closer to learning if this is an asset class you want to get involved in. And at the end, we'll have time for Q&A as well. We love hanging out and answering your questions, so you can start thinking of your questions on the stuff that I'm sharing with you today, or any other questions that you might have about this process. I'm more than happy to stay on and answer your questions. So, the team will be watching the questions as they go through as well, and we'll pick those all up at the end. So feel free to drop stuff in the chat. And then when we get to the Q&A part, we will pick those up and answer them for you.

Okay. So let's talk process. Process is the system that you want to set for yourself in terms of how you are going through the business buying process, right? If you don't have a system, if you don't have a process, then it is very easy to get lost in things and not do things that are actually productive. So if you're actually marking out the steps of what you should do and in what order, it allows you to be a lot more cutthroat on your time. So I know most of us here are probably doing other things; you're not searching full time. So how do you make the most of the time available for your search? Well, having a process that you use and then time blocking — we talked a lot about this in the last session.

So last time we talked about the deal review process. We have an email that a lot of our opportunities come into. We have our team then clean that data and put it into our deal review inbox on Notion. Then we do the first review. So we review everything top-line for a few markers, and we decide if we want to then click into that. When we click into it, if we're still happy with it, then we will move it to RFI, which is request for information. And that's what we're going to talk about today.

So request for information is when you've seen a listing on the site and you're like, I like this, I want more information, I'm going to fill out the form. So that's where we're picking up today. Assume that you've found a business listing that you like. We're going to talk on-market for most of today, but the template that Anca created will also track off-market, and we'll talk through the stages that we go through there. But for on-market, you've requested information. Then the next step is typically you will get an NDA sent to you. Some brokers have an automatic process to send you the NDA. Many do not. So a lot of our time is spent chasing brokers and we have to keep track of this so we know who to chase and when we chase them and how much we need to chase them. So Anca is becoming an expert stalker. She is learning how to track them down and find them no matter where they hang out in the interwebs or in this world. But it is an important step for you to track so that you can keep track of the things that you made a request for information on and know if you need to chase those or not.

Then the next step is: after you've signed an NDA, hopefully the broker sends you a CIM (Confidential Information Memorandum). It is basically the marketing document about the business and will typically include some financial data about the business. There is no standardization to CIMs, so it can be one page, it can be 80. You just never know. It's like a little surprise every time you open it to see how much information you're going to get. Once you get a CIM, we review it and then we decide if we want to move forward with having a call with the broker to clarify everything that wasn't answered in the CIM and make a decision on whether we think it is a worthwhile business to put in front of our clients.

So this is our process. The template that we're going to share with you doesn't include the write-up, but this is what we do — all the work that we do leading up to actually submitting a business to our clients for them to review. So we prepare a write-up that includes top-line financial analysis, things that we like, that we don't like, transcripts from the broker call, and then we get our clients to sign an NDA. We submit to the client and then they decide if they want to move forward. We've got a hundred percent hit rate on our clients wanting to have a conversation — have them go to the next step. So the team is really good at identifying opportunities that will be of interest to our clients.

But let's dive into the numbers. So here's a little snapshot into the numbers that we get in our business. And remember we're optimized at this, so you're probably going to need to do more while you're learning this process, but I like sharing the numbers because people can get very frustrated that they're not finding a business and not getting good deal flow. And it almost always comes down to not looking at enough deals, to not having enough conversations, to not pushing enough volume through your funnel, through that process.

Okay. So here's our benchmark. These are the numbers for like one client, say for six months. We started with almost a thousand listings that we looked at. Forty percent of those we looked a little bit deeper into. Twenty-two percent of those we requested information. Seventy percent of those we got information back on. Right? So you can sign NDAs and chase the broker to no end and never end up with the information about the business, or the business goes under offer before they send it out. Like a manner of things can happen after you request information, sign the NDA.

Then, of the ones that we actually get the CIMs from, only 35 percent of those we decide that we want to have a further conversation with the broker. So we're reviewing the CIM and kind of looking and seeing: is there enough in here for us to move forward, or are there any deal breakers from our really tight deal box that we are following that would eliminate this business? So of the CIMs we reviewed, 35 percent of those move to broker conversations. But when we decide to have a broker conversation, usually we're pretty clear that we like the business, but we want to get some clarifying info before we hand it over to our clients. So of those broker conversations, about 70 percent of those then move to the point where we would consider moving forward or consider an LOI. So the reality check for you here is that we're really good at this. We've been doing this for a long time and we've done thousands of these. So our conversion rate from the top-line listings that we're reviewing through to looking at an LOI is 1.4 percent. So when you multiply the amount of listings that you need to look at yourself, I would double or triple these numbers. It's a volume game here.

Then off-market: a lot of people get distracted, I think, by off-market thinking there's better deals there. If you're wanting to buy a business this year, in the next couple months, then I would encourage you to go on-market. Off-market is very cumbersome. There's a lot of correspondence that you need to go through, and not only that — you need to kind of educate these owners and coach them as you go through this. So Ryan's an expert at this. He's dealt with thousands of owners over his five, six years doing this. And owners don't know what ad backs are. Owners don't know how valuations work, right? They've just been running their business and they're really good at it. So if you're not really good at educating people as you go through the process, then I would stick to on-market because that's what the broker does. The broker does that job for you, and they hopefully are doing a good job.

So for off-market, for example, for one client in five months, we contacted 934 owners. We had to send 1,700 emails to get 30 that responded to us. Our conversion rate is very high compared to the other numbers that I've seen — like 1.8 percent response rate. It's exceptionally higher compared to the other ones that I've seen. Of those, we only got just over half of the responses that were qualified in terms of the criteria that we were looking at. And of those, we got one under LOI. So when you look at the numbers of the owners you need to contact to be able to get an LOI — and this is us being highly optimized — it was 0.11 percent. The number of emails to LOI conversion is 0.06 percent. So the numbers are stark when it comes to off-market. So that's another reason why I like to encourage folks: if you're doing this part-time in and around other things, stick to on-market, because that's where you're going to be able to get the volume.

Okay. So we've talked numbers. And now that you know the numbers, how do we actually keep track of all these deals? Right? This is just one client, but to keep track of like 80 conversations just in info requested, and then another 60 — it's a lot of conversations and it's very easy to get lost in the mix. So we're going to share this Excel template with you. You can use Excel, or Google Sheets is where this is at if you're more comfortable with that, and it's going to include everything that I'm about to show you in Notion. If you are a HubSpot user or a different CRM user, you can actually plug in all of your deals into this template and then import them into HubSpot. Not going to spend a lot of time here, but you are going to get this template and I've included all the validation key stuff at the back, so you can go in and edit that yourself if you wanted to use this one.

But let's look at this amazing pipeline tracker that Anca created. You guys are going to get this. This is this amazing system that she's created to be able to keep track of your deals. And then you actually have like a CRM system that you're going to be able to move them around in those various stages. I'm going to show you a little bit about that, and then we're going to talk through the stages that you want to be tracking as you go through this.

So, on this template, you've got the CRM, which is the contacts of the person that you're dealing with, and you're able to change the job title. You can edit all of these little categories here, but most of the time you're going to be dealing with a broker or a business owner. And then keeping track of all their details, right? What's their email address, phone number, what city are they in? If it's a broker, what's the company name? What type of company are we dealing with? Is there a domain name, etc.? When's the last time we contacted them? Any notes that we want to make on this, and then what deal is it related to? So in the CRM, this is contacts of people. And then a deal might have multiple contacts, right? There might be multiple owners. So we also make a deal name for every opportunity that we're looking at, and then that way you can assign some things to it — like, is it on or off market? Is there a link to the listing?

We also create a Google Drive file for every deal and keep all the information that we're getting on there, and you can save that in here. So then when you go to your on-market pipeline, you're able to see the details on the deal. You're able to see the contacts on it and assign multiple contacts, and you can just click into that if you're a Notion user and add a bunch of stuff here. But then you've got your link to all your files right there. You can change the property on it very easily right from here, or what's even cooler about Notion is that you can just move it around and it's going to change the status. When you do your first review, you decide you're ready for asking for information, so you can put it in there. And then when you've requested information on a deal, this is where you should start tracking, because as I showed you, you can request information on a deal and never get the NDA back. So you want to track these people down. We sometimes resubmit on the site. Sometimes we find their individual website. Sometimes we go to their LinkedIn. Sometimes we do all of it. Our pipeline is actually split out, and we have four steps that they go through after information requested to try to track this stuff down.

Then you've got the NDA. So next step would be: I've got the NDA. Then you sign the NDA. Once you sign the NDA, again, you might have to do some chasing in order to get that teaser or get that CIM off of the broker. So the reason why you should track all of these stages is that you can time block. If I am short on time, then I know, okay, today I'm going to go in and sign all the NDAs that I got. Then you can just blast through all of these at the same time.

And I didn't mention, but I am a high performance nerd. I wrote a book which is unpublished, but one day will come out, and ran a high performance business for a couple of years. So I'm kind of obsessed with how we can be the most optimized. And time blocking and keeping your headspace in the same energy as you go through things makes you a heck of a lot more productive rather than trying to skip around these. So that is the benefit of having something like this — you can go in and do all of the same things and then move on to the next, because signing an NDA is going to be very different than reviewing a CIM.

So once you get the CIM, you can add them all here and be like, okay, here's my inbox now for the CIMs that I need to review. Then you can move it to reviewed. For those that you like, then you can move to, okay, I need to schedule a call with the broker and follow up with them. So then you can go through all of those tasks. When you have the call scheduled, that is another step. It doesn't necessarily mean that you're going to have the call because sometimes brokers miss the call. So we've split out all of these steps that we go through ourselves, right, and that we keep track of ourselves, because call got scheduled, something came up and call didn't happen. Once the call is completed, then scheduling a call with the owner, completing the call with the owner. And it's a little bit simplified here, but let's assume that you've had calls with the owner, you like the business, then you outline the terms that you're going to submit to them. And I like people to submit their terms before they submit an LOI so that you can hash all that out before you get to LOI, so there's no surprises when you get into diligence. So we outline the terms, agree the terms, submit the LOI, sign the LOI, initiate the due diligence, secure the finance, then complete the due diligence, then finalize the purchase agreement and go through all of that. That is your on-market pipeline.

Can you see how many steps there are? And this is even after all the stuff we covered in the last workshop — after you decided, okay, I've gone through the listings, I've reviewed the listings, I have clicked into the listings, I've requested information. Then we get to this step. So there are a lot of steps to this process. And when you track it, you can keep track of all of your conversations and go from there.

Off-market is a little bit similar, so we've included that here too. If you do want to connect with off-market — or maybe you're doing what you should be doing, which is talking to absolutely everybody you come across and telling them you're a business buyer, and they're like, “Oh my gosh, you should talk to my so-and-so who has a business that they're selling.” That would technically be an off-market conversation. So then you could go through this process too. This is our process: we contact them. They respond. We then send vetting questions to make sure that it's worthwhile for everybody to have a conversation. When they qualify, then we send a meeting link for them to schedule a link with us. They schedule the meeting. They attend the meeting. After the meeting, if we decide they're a good fit and they feel like they want to continue a conversation, we'll send an NDA to them — and I highly recommend this if you are wanting to contact owners directly to make them feel comfortable working with you. NDA sent, NDA received. And then after that, we request financials from them. This can take all manner of time. And now that people can wait until October to do their tax returns, we're almost in July and we are still waiting for owners to finish their 2023 taxes. And then after that, we also get to have the fun of working with them and educating them on ad backs, right? So we want to determine the all-important SDE — what is that cash flow number that we might have available to us as new owners? Then we review all the financials, schedule a follow-up call, and then we've removed what we do. So this is for you — having a follow-up call after you've reviewed the financials and you're like, okay, this is a business that I want to move forward on. Probably going to be a lot of follow-up calls. And then you outline some terms and agree those terms, submit an LOI and go through that whole process again.

There is — I cannot stress enough — how long this process takes from initial interest through to finally getting all the financials and the information from owners. It's not that they're not interested, but they're not necessarily wanting to sell right now. Occasionally we will hit on somebody that's like, “Yep, I'm ready. Let's go.” And even then they still take seven months to finish their taxes for the year before. So when you're dealing with off-market, these folks are still actively running their business and they're kind of like entertaining the idea, but they have other things that they're doing. So there's a lot of polite chasing and handholding as you go through the off-market process.

That is a template we're going to be sharing with you today so you can use that yourself. You can also do all of this in HubSpot. This is what we use — HubSpot. I've been a HubSpot girl for 10 years. I think it's incredible. If you want to keep track of the conversations, it actually has trackers for all of the emails and that sort of thing. But it's too much firepower for most people, so this is enough for you to be able to keep track of everything, and it's simple, so you'll be able to use it.

The thing that, when I talk about productivity and when I talk about high performance, we can often feel like we're being productive by getting a piece of tech and setting up that piece of tech and then not actually taking the steps. So I'd like you to have the simplest process possible that you're doing on your own. And even the to-do list process and the project management process that I've been teaching for years — it starts with a real notebook and actually just handwriting those things, because if you don't have a process that works for you analog, then tech really isn't going to be — you should be looking for tech that supports you to do what you do better.

So don't get lost in the productivity of setting up a bunch of tech and not actually taking the steps. The thing that's going to get you the business is signing those NDAs, is having those conversations, is talking to business owners — getting your reps in is what we call it in this world. So this template is very simple. Don't let it stop you from getting your reps in.

And let me just remind you of this amazing deal inbox template that Anca created. When we share the replay link, you'll be able to go to the previous webinars and download this also. This is where you ideally want to have Zapier or maybe hire somebody that can do data input for you from your email that's getting all your listings so that you can review it really quickly and look at the most important things, which is the profit, where is it, what is the title of it. And then you can click these buttons and kind of move it around in this pipeline to be able to analyze businesses really quickly. So we did a whole webinar on that two weeks ago; replay’s up for you to be able to do that.

Another thing I think is important to remind you of is calculating the money that will be available to you after debt service and all the deal costs. I can't tell you how many people I'm like, “How much money do you want to take home when you buy a business?” And they're like, “$250,000.” Okay, what size businesses are you looking at? “I'm looking at businesses with an [SDE of] $250,000.” You can't do that if you're going to not be paying all cash for it, if you're utilizing SBA. So this calculator is also going to be on that replay link. It allows you to put in what the revenue is, what the SDE or profit that they've listed in the listing is, and what the asking price is, and it's going to show you your multiple. It's also going to calculate some working capital and deal costs so that you get your total loan costs here. Assuming you're using SBA, you know, you can change the APR, the loan term, and the down payment, but this is a standard that we're seeing right now. And you're going to get two calculations here that will show you what the business looks like without any of the working capital or deal costs as a debt service coverage ratio, and with that. But also this green box is really important. So if you want $250,000 and you are looking at businesses with $250,000 [SDE], you are looking at a business that is probably going to net you $80,000. So making sure you're doing those calculations.

That is another important reason why we like having those Drive links very quickly. For every deal that we analyze, we make a copy of that deal calculator so that we can go in and see what the numbers are. So you can create a Google Drive or wherever you're storing your stuff and put that link on your CRM so that you can really quickly click into it. You want to save the CIMs there, the financials, that sort of thing.

Okay. So that is the tour of the templates. Now we're going to get into my favorite part, which is some reality checking. We're going to talk about the common problems that I am hearing folks talk about in this world when you're looking for businesses.

One of the things that I hear a lot is that there's not enough good deals out there. There are so many businesses out there and a lot of them for sale. And if you are not finding enough good deals, that tells me you're not looking at enough opportunities. So you need to ramp up your game. Increase your deal flow, widen your deal box, stay consistent, speed up your decision making. If you're not getting enough deal flow, then there's some restriction on that. Either you're not looking at enough opportunities and putting enough time in to look at those opportunities, or you're doing something like the folks here in Austin are doing — they're like, “I'm only looking at businesses in Austin in this industry.” Well, guess what? Austin is a tiny town and there's not that many businesses for sale. So if you want a business, you got to widen your geography. Being real about your deal box — your restrictions might be the thing that is causing a lack of deal flow — or you're just not being consistent and putting in the time.

The search is the hardest part of this process. That's not to underplay how hard it is to be a business owner. So even if you were buying something that functions well, it is still going to be painful on some days when you buy a business. But the search of looking for a business is the hardest part.

So here's some other numbers, right? In order to get one that moves forward, you're probably having to look at 379 listings. So if you want to get to LOI, that means it's about 3,100 listings that you need to scan in order to submit one LOI. That's our numbers — our optimized numbers. So you're probably going to have to do more than that as you learn how to do this. So if you're telling me there's not enough good deal flow, you haven't submitted an LOI, I'm going to ask you if you've looked at 3,100 listings in order to find that deal. Most of us are probably not going to be able to answer that.

“Brokers won't get back to me.” Yeah, they are over-inundated with the tsunami of people that have discovered this asset class, right? Brokers were just kind of happily in business-broker land, where nobody knew that they could just buy and sell businesses. And they do not have CRM systems. They do not have tech. They are not equipped to handle the hundreds of people that are asking them about these deals. And also they're having deals that don't go through because somebody has a bankruptcy, and you can't get SBA financing, for the most part, when you have a bankruptcy. Or they don't have the money to actually be able to get the deal financed. So they are getting so tight on who they are giving information to, on who they are speaking to. And they just don't have the capacity most of the time to be able to respond to everybody. So if brokers aren't getting back to you, then pound the pavement. My team are constantly reaching out to them. Be polite, obviously, and you also want to present yourself as a serious contender. Show them you mean business. Show them that you are qualified. Show them that you have a good background. Show them that you are financially capable of getting this deal done. And when you show your commitment and capability, they will listen. Our brokers that we deal with on behalf of our clients — they know that we are bringing them buyers that we have already verified. We've vetted them. We've made sure that they're able to get the deal done and that they would make good business owners.

“I hear this all the time: it's priced too high.” Okay. You're eliminating it before you even have a conversation. There is negotiation that goes on as you go through this process. So if this deal ticks all of your boxes and the thing that isn't working is the price, that is something you can negotiate. And chances are if it's really priced too high, then other people are not making offers on it. So what you want to look at is: how are you calculating its worth? Can the cash flow cover the debt service? Are you thinking about creative financing options, or structuring performance-based notes? We have two deals that have gotten term sheets now recently structuring it with a performance-based forgivable note using SBA financing so the debt service doesn't get blown out. Are you thinking about investors? Are you thinking about the other ways that you can get this deal done? So don't dismiss a potentially great business because it's priced too high. You can negotiate and you can structure, and the terms can turn it into a win. If there are not any other red flags, keep moving on this one because you never know what you can negotiate.

“This is hard.” Yeah, it's really hard. And if you're finding this process tough, just wait until you're running a full-blown business. Entrepreneurship isn't for the faint-hearted, even if you are buying an already existing business. So if you're up for it — if you want to be an entrepreneur — prove it and show up every day and keep doing this, because I guarantee you, if you show up every day, if you're consistent, if you keep getting your reps in and keep showing up, you're going to find that business.

Me and my team are listening to a podcast right now — a woman who is incredible. And she spent two years looking for a business. She assembled an intern team of five people. The stuff she did to be able to find this business was insane, but it was two years. It's hard. It's meant to be hard. It's a limiter because when you own the business, it's also going to be hard. My friend bought an amazing transmission repair shop — $6 million deal — and he's not doing the tools himself; the shop runs itself. But there was a big freeze and the pipes burst in the building. They had to stop working on things because the pipes burst. No plumbers were available. Guess what he had to do? He had to go and figure out how to be a plumber that day. This is just what happens when we own a business. It stops with us.

This is the one that kind of grates me a little bit and I will call you out on it: “I don't have time.” We spend time where our priorities are. So if you're not spending time on this, then it indicates to me it's not a priority for you. You either make time or you waste time. So if you say you're busy, that's not an excuse. Busy is a state of mind. You are in charge of your own calendar, of your own time. I don't even like using the word busy. It's still kind of a trigger for me because busy is something that I create and I have control over. You will never get a business if you don't prioritize finding one. You can hire someone if you don't have time to make the most out of the time that you have available so that your time spent is delivering a high ROI. That's what a lot of our clients come to us for — they have the intention, they have the ability, but they don't have a lot of available time. So they want to spend the time that they have available on the most valuable actions they can take. So you hire someone. “Who Not How” — great book, something that everybody should read. Then you read “Buy Back Your Time” to learn how to actually implement Who Not How. Getting people to do things for you so that you can spend your time. But if you're not making any time for this, you won't find the business. And on average, if you're doing this part time on your own, unassisted, you're probably looking at about a two-year search. One to two years without assistance.

Okay, boom! We're done with the reality check. I do all that to motivate you, right? I see those things and I'm like, no, I can do this. I'm going to buck up and I'm going to do it.

So we're going to set some goals because I don't want you coming and spending your time here today — your valuable time, your most valuable resource — and not take action as a result of what we talked about today. So if we set goals together and create some accountability, then you are more likely to take the actions, which is going to get the result that you want, which I hope is buying a business or getting you closer to deciding if this is something that you want to do.

So let's set some goals together. I want you to think about one action you can track and how much of that you are going to do by our next workshop, July 11th — so two weeks from now. Let me give you my email address. I want you to send me an email right now. This is the accountability. I'm going to read every single one of these. You're committing to an action; you're sending it to Athena. I want you to tell me the specific action you're going to take to get started, the timeline for the action, and what your measurable goal is going to be by July 11th.

Let me give you an example: I'm going to download that pipeline template so I can start tracking reps by the end of this week — that's tomorrow — and before July 11th, I'm going to review at least 50 listings. Be brave, set some accountability, send it to me. Nothing bad will happen if you don't do it, but you're probably going to be much more inspired to do that.

Go ahead and think of what your accountability can be. Don't take too much time on it. What are you going to do as a result of today? Hopefully it's: you're going to snag that Notion template and you're going to update it with the deals that you're already discussing; or you're going to go back and watch the workshop that you missed last time and learn how to get that deal flow into your inbox in the first place; or you're going to use the deal calculator. There are a lot of things that we gave you today — a ton of resources. What would absolutely make my heart sing is that you use these resources to get you closer to the deal that is going to be the one. And I have this as a reminder right behind my computer: “You are only one deal away from fundamentally changing your life.” Just one. So don't let anything stop you. Consistency and taking those actions is what's going to help you get that deal.

I've got a few more things I'm going to talk about, but I love questions. I love answering your questions, so start dropping those in the chat now. My team is going to grab them and we're going to talk about them at the end. We're going to send the replay out by tomorrow, but we're going to send you an email right after this and remind you — if you haven't already, send me the email with your accountability goal. And we're going to include all the templates that we talked about today. Anca is going to drop the link now in the chat for you to grab those templates also. So you can grab them right away, but don't forget to send me that email with your accountability. And then the replay video will be up by tomorrow.

Our next session — we do these every two weeks at the exact same bat time, same bat place. So July 11th at 12pm, we are going to be talking about the all-important deal box, which is your GPS — programming your GPS so you know where you're going with a successful business acquisition. What should I be looking for? How should I program my GPS? What is my deal box, which is your deal parameters that you are assessing whether a business is a good fit for you.

Now, if you're interested in working with us and you don't have a lot of time, or you're interested in having some people support you through this journey, we do have a wait list, but you can fill out the form. Anca is going to drop the link in the chat and get started there and talk to us about working together.

Anca's dropping the links in the chat, but also you can just scan this QR code, and it's going to take you right to the replay page. On there, you'll get all the templates that I showed you today. There will be the link for you to register for the next webinar, and there'll be a link for you to sign up to get access to the previous webinars that we've run. One is the: What are all the tools available to me in deal sourcing? Should I go on or off market? That's the first webinar that we ran. The second one was getting everything into a deal inbox for you to scan — that second Notion template that I shared with you. That's there. You're going to get the deal calculator template that's in there, and the amazing CRM system that Anca built for you all to have. I can't believe we're sharing stuff like this, but it's so cool. I wish stuff like this existed when I started my search. I had to figure it all out myself and I didn't have an Anca then. So my stuff wasn't nearly as good and straightforward. So grab all that.

We're going to go into questions. That was so much fun, y'all. I don't know if you could tell — my energy is just getting higher and higher after all this, because I'm such a nerd and I love talking buying businesses.

[00:55:00]
Athena Simpson (Presenter, AcquiMatch): All right, Ryan, do we have any questions?

Ryan (Q&A Moderator): All right, first question we have is from Pender. Pender says: Where are deals normally listed? Is it all over the place or is there an industry agreement on a handful of reputable websites that people use?

Athena Simpson (Presenter, AcquiMatch): Yeah, great question, Pender. I'm so excited to see you here again. We have about a hundred different — at least a hundred, I think — sources that we track on-market deals. The main ones are BizBuySell, BusinessesForSale, and BizQuest. You can also look at the IBBA website, which is the International Business Brokers Association. They have some listings there. And then in the last — was it the last webinar? — where we listed all of the different listing sites. That'll get you started, though. Those are the main public ones. If you want a good aggregator and you want to pay some money for it, Kumo is our favorite of all the different aggregator sites that are out there. In terms of the paid memberships on other sites at this level, I think you should get enough through Kumo — and you don't even need Kumo. Kumo is basically scraping all the other sites that are out there. But then once you start looking at listing sites, you can also scope out who are the brokers in your area and start hitting them up, because a lot of times they'll have email lists or they'll notify you before they actually list something publicly. It's a lot of work and a lot of pain in the butt for a broker to put it on one of the listing sites because they get hundreds of people kicking the tires on it. So they like to go to their database first, oftentimes before putting it out publicly.

Ryan (Q&A Moderator): Great question. Next question we have is from Amaro. Amaro asks: What is your fee structure?

Athena Simpson (Presenter, AcquiMatch): Yeah. So if you're interested in working with us, fill out the form and then we can get a proposal together for you. But to give you kind of an idea of how we work: there is an onboarding fee to get started and go through that month-long process with us where we do some deal clarity with you.

When I was looking at and exploring using services myself — I did try to hire deal sourcers myself when I was starting — there are business brokers; we don't really have a lot of competition because what we do is really hard. It's really hard, and there's not a lot of people trying to do the same thing. There are people that will source businesses for you just off-market, but they don't give you any consultancy or support. You basically have to come fully baked with your idea of what you want, and then they don't necessarily coach the owners through everything — they just find out if somebody is willing to sell or not. And then there's buy-side brokers. So they're business brokers typically that have the time, for some reason, to represent buyers, and they will negotiate on your behalf and that sort of thing.

Most of these folks take a percentage of the purchase price. Now, that didn't make sense to me because I want you to get the best deal possible, which means lowering the price, right? So if I'm incentivized by you paying more money for this deal, then that doesn't really make sense to me. So our fee structure is: there is a transaction fee; there is a success fee when you purchase the business. Those fees can be packaged into your financing, which is awesome — with a lot of your deal costs, some of your lawyer fees, some of the fees to get the financing done. You can package that all in your loan and then amortize it over the life of the loan. But we do a flat fee, and then there's a monthly advance on the fee while you're searching with us. So if you're interested in working with us, fill out the form, and then we can do a more customized consideration of that. But that's how we structure it. And then that way our fees are aligned with you, right? I don't want my team working for free because then they're going to be pushing businesses on you quickly to try to get paid, and this is what most business brokers do — they work for free until they close the deal. We're not working for free, but that money you pay us while we're searching for you acts as an advance on the final success fee, so you get credited that in the end. And then that way we're all incentivized to get you to close.

Ryan (Q&A Moderator): Next question is from Aaron. Aaron asks: If you find a deal that fits the deal box of several clients, how do you prioritize who gets it first?

Athena Simpson (Presenter, AcquiMatch): That's a really great question. And we actually select clients so that we don't have that situation. We don't take on clients that are looking for the exact same things or have overlaps in the deal box. Occasionally there might be — I think we've had three clients with some slight overlap — but it's a pretty clear decision for us on what would be a good fit because we're not just looking at industry, location, SDE. We're also looking at what are the skill sets and backgrounds of our clients and will it be a good fit for this business. Some businesses need a really strong operational owner to come in, and if somebody has a sales background, that might not be as clear of a fit as something where it's like, “If somebody with a really great sales background came into this business, they would rocket-ship it.” So that's what we're looking at. So it's very, very unlikely that that happens, and we actually don't take clients that have super-overlapping deal boxes for that reason. We can put you on the wait list, and then when that territory kind of opens up, then we'll start a search for you there.

Ryan (Q&A Moderator): We can take more questions, guys. If you have any other questions, feel free to drop them in the chat and we can get to them. Right now we have another question from Amaro. Amaro asks: What is the deal size range you guys work on in SDE terms?

Athena Simpson (Presenter, AcquiMatch): We typically are looking — I think the smallest deal box that we have is looking for $200,000 after debt service. That is a little bit small. So we like to see at least $300,000 after debt service. And then we get into the EBITDA ranges. Typically after a million or so, then you're starting to look at businesses with an EBITDA marker rather than an SDE or adjusted EBITDA. We look at everything up to — some of our clients are entertaining $9 and $10 million enterprise values. I'd say if you want to work with us, I think it's a good return on investment if you're looking at at least $300,000 after debt service.

Ryan (Q&A Moderator): Next question we have is from Luis. He asks: Could you please explain how the Kumo aggregator helps and why it is a good practice?

Athena Simpson (Presenter, AcquiMatch): Yeah. Luis, what I would say is if you want to learn the tools, we actually did a webinar on the tools available to you for deal sourcing. We get a little bit more in the weeds on that, so that would be a great one for you to go back to. Kumo allows you to set personalized search parameters and then Kumo itself is going out and scraping all of the listing sites. Then you can set, okay, I want this location, I want these industries, I want this amount of money, and Kumo pulls in from all these different sources into one feed. It's a hundred dollars a month, but it can save you some time from having to go and sign up on all those listing sites individually. It does miss some stuff — even though it is scraping all the sites — so that is just one of our hundred kind of sources that we pull in ourselves. It's a really great place to save some time though and be able to be dialed in on your own search. What we like about it is that it also will send email notifications when you have new deals that hit your search parameters. We will use that — we have a data entry team that will then take everything in the inbox — which we talked about last time, so watch the last webinar as well, both of them are going to be important for you — and set up an email specifically for listings and then have someone do data entry into that Notion dashboard so you can review it all there.

Ryan (Q&A Moderator): Okay. Matthew has a question. He asked: What are the best sources to get contacts for off-market deals?

Athena Simpson (Presenter, AcquiMatch): I tried all of the AI tools out there — we tried all of them — and I wanted to love them. I wanted there to be a source where you could just plug something in and some AI magic robot finds me contact details for owners. We couldn't find that. We tried all the tools and for small businesses, a lot of these owners don't have an internet presence. A lot of them don't even have a website. So we have a team that do research for us. You don't necessarily need a team — you can go on to Upwork and hire somebody to research for you. But when I started this before I had a team, when I was doing it on my own, I would go on Google Maps and just look at my local area and see if I could find the owner detail. It's just a ton of time. You're trying to find their personal contact details, or you can show up on their doorstep. Hiring someone at a reasonable rate to do the research for you is what we found to be the most reliable, because the AI tools might scrape website data, but they'll give you generic email addresses, and what you really need is to get the contact details of the owner.

Ryan (Q&A Moderator): Okay, so Hale asks: Could you please share about AcquiMatch — when you started the company and why? What's the inspiration to create the company, and what problems it can solve?

Athena Simpson (Presenter, AcquiMatch): Wow, I love that. When I was searching myself, I just kind of felt on my own through the process. There are some masterminds and stuff out there, but when I go deep on something, I go hard, and I quickly felt like I was just kind of on my own and figuring everything out. I also desperately wanted to find an off-market deal when I started, which I think I wasted a lot of time doing — which is why I really encourage people to go on-market, because the property management deal that I mentioned that I found at the beginning was actually on-market. I still grieve losing that business, but were it not for losing that business, I wouldn't have started this business.

So I saw three main problems for self-funded searchers and first-time buyers that they were encountering as they went through the business buying process. The first was: I have a skill set from this industry; I'm not sure how that translates into buying businesses, so I don't know how to define my deal box or what type of businesses that I should be looking at or what type of businesses I would be good at buying. That deal box — figuring out the guardrails of what is a good business for me. We're particularly skilled at working with people that are industry-agnostic — they don't have a specific industry in mind — so we’re able to match things like: what are their long-term aspirations? What are their goals? What are their skill sets? What's the culture of this business? And we get really excited about visualizing our clients in the business. That's where it really changed the game for me in my own search — when I found a business that I would literally do anything, like raise $3 million in five days, to hang on to that business because I saw myself so clearly in it.

Then, obviously, the main thing that I think we all struggle with is finding a business. It's very hard to search for a business. I messed around with a bunch of off-market stuff, but on my own it was very cumbersome and I hit a lot of roadblocks, and my templates weren't working or the processes that I was using weren't working. I put on this whole big event to try to get owners to come and learn about selling their business and spent a ton of money and time — and I had one owner show up. When all that time I could have been looking on-market. The reason why most of these other services — and there's not many — don't do on-market is because of the things that I described to you. My team is stalking brokers constantly, trying to get that information. It's a lot of work. It's very cumbersome. So we help people with that — the actual sourcing of the business.

And then the other thing that people were not confident about or wanted some support in was: how do I know if this is a good business? I know I'll be a great business owner, but when I'm looking at a business, how do I analyze this? I've never looked at financials like this before, or I don't know what I should be looking for in terms of whether this is a good business or not. So we solve for those three things: we help figure out what you should be looking for; we look for it; we present you opportunities that we vet and analyze. Around and alongside all of that is being able to partner with us and have a consultant and an advisor through every step of the way. Even though we hand you over an opportunity for you to take forward and decide if you want to move into LOI, we've got templates, we've got financial modeling. Lenders love us and love our clients because we help our clients get the packaging of the finances into a way that will actually get financed. What happens is a lot of people make an offer that they can't actually get a loan for because it doesn't work as far as debt service is concerned. We are also introducing our clients to amazing deal team — financial due diligence and lawyers, lenders, insurance due diligence. Our client success is our success.

When I was going through this process and when I was trying to buy that property management deal, the thing that was so upsetting for me was: I'm literally the best person to run this business. I still believe it to this day with my background and my skill set match for that business. But I was at a disadvantage because I didn't know how to be competitive with these strategics. I didn't know how this process worked. It was the first time I kind of went through it to that level of detail and in such a competitive situation. Had I had someone like AcquiMatch, I wouldn't have lost that deal. And I would have my perfect business. So that's why I want to help other people find their perfect business and be competitive in a situation when you're an individual and limited by that. There's also intrinsically valuable work in helping owners that have built these businesses off their backs hand over to somebody that is going to look after that business and their clients and their customers the way that they would, instead of them selling to private equity that's just going to tear it up and sell it in a couple of years to make money off of it. And then I get to help people that want to be an entrepreneur but they don't want to start a business — they're in the golden-handcuffs situation or frustrated that they don't have purpose every day as an entrepreneur — and I get to help them into entrepreneurship. It's rewarding on every angle. So that's why we started it. That's why we get up every day and do what we do.

Ryan (Q&A Moderator): Last question from Jay we have here — if anybody else has any questions, this is the last one. Jay asks: How do you approach a business off-market that has multiple owners?

Athena Simpson (Presenter, AcquiMatch): That's a very specific question and a good question. Typically there won't be a 50/50 split with owners. Sometimes owners don't all want to sell. Sometimes one of them wants to get out. Then you're looking at a situation where you might end up coming in as a partial equity holder of that business — you buy out one of the partners. I would approach it the same as any other. If you're doing off-market, it is so much about developing rapport and a relationship with that owner, getting them to trust you — but being trustable — and seeing if you could be a good steward of their business and finding out if you think you could fill their shoes. One of the things I like doing is: when you have that owner meeting, you get a gut check of, “Am I on their level, or am I totally out of my depth here?”

With multiple owners, depending on what their situation is, some might be limited partners. We have a client that just went under offer on a business that had a 15 percent owner and an 85 percent owner, and the 85 percent owner wanted out and the 15 percent owner — who stays on the floor and does all the work — wanted to stay in. That was great for the new buyer because they got somebody that built the business, that understands it, that wants to do the operation side of things, which isn't necessarily their background or skill set. So you might have a win there if you can keep some of the owners in. But then you get into the whole conversation of: are we going to get along? Do we have the same vision? That is one of the challenges when you're working with multiple owners — they might want to keep things the same, and you're like, I want to innovate. I want to do some stuff here. Obviously don't change anything in the business for at least the first three months — ideally the first six to twelve months — you're not changing anything because there's usually a reason why everything is the way it is. We young bucks can get excited and go in there and change a bunch of stuff and tank the business. But you want to really, really vet that that owner is somebody that you share the vision, work ethic, and can work together well with before you do that.

Ryan (Q&A Moderator): Aaron has another question. He asks: Can you elaborate further how having this service could counteract the strategic $2 million higher offer?

Athena Simpson (Presenter, AcquiMatch): Structuring. And when I say structuring, I mean — great question, by the way — how you put together the financing and terms. I didn't know enough about the limitations or the gray areas when it came to SBA financing. The broker introduced me to an SBA lender, and I was just coming off what the SBA lender said. It was also a competitive situation, so I didn't have visibility of what the other offers were. They were just like, put your best foot forward. The way in which the SBA banker told me to structure the deal — now, knowing what I do — didn't make sense, and I could have made a much more competitive offer had I structured it in a different way; had I used the investor money in a different way; had I found a different lender.

Additionally, there are a lot of SBA guidelines that changed towards the end of last year, and you'd think that brokers would keep up to speed on this stuff, but they don't. I was in a situation recently where I had to put a broker in his place that he didn't know what he was talking about with the SBA financing, because there's a lot of things that you can do now — like performance-based forgivable notes; you can do rollovers without the owners having to put a personal guarantee. A lot of the time the brokers are working off old assumptions with SBA and not current guidelines. I haven't yet found a resource where you can learn all of this stuff. So we support clients with that and we're able to help them structure it. We have a multitude of really awesome lenders now, too, that we know are willing to work with us and with our buyers to structure things in a way that — unlike that lender that I did that deal with — doesn't put you at a disadvantage. I was in a situation where I was like, I don't know what I'm doing — okay, I'll raise this money — and the way he was going to apply the money that I raised wasn't actually helping me get the most out of that money and putting that money to work. I could have matched the offer had I known what I do now. We help clients with that because, on top of everything else, having to learn all the SBA guidelines and rules when you might only do this once — it's a little insane. We can help shorten that learning curve and just be a support system. And if we don't know the answer, we have a bunch of people that we can tap. Our network is great to be able to get those answers for clients too.

Ryan (Q&A Moderator): Next question is from Crystal. She asks: How long is your wait list right now to work with your company?

Athena Simpson (Presenter, AcquiMatch): Great question. We are taking new clients now for a September start on the search. We can do the onboarding — the onboarding takes at least a month, so you want to factor that in when you're working with us. Getting the onboarding fee sorted with us is what gets you next in line. So the next availability for a search start is going to be September right now.

Athena Simpson (Presenter, AcquiMatch): That is it for the questions today. Oh my gosh, y'all are so awesome. Thank you for spending all this time with us and for your really great questions. We love doing this, and I love being able to introduce you to the amazing team that makes up AcquiMatch and helps people become business owners. We're going to be doing this again in two weeks — July 11th. We're going to be talking about that deal box and how you can get clarity and set your GPS.

If you haven't, don't forget to send me an email with your goal, your accountability — what I can hold you accountable for in two weeks’ time. We'll also send out an email with the links to everything. Because you attended, you're going to get the links right now. You can check back tomorrow and the video should be up if you want to revisit anything that we discussed today. Any questions or anything that comes up in the meantime, please feel free to let me know. And like I said, if you're interested in working with us, there is a form which you can fill out that'll get you started. We don't take on clients we can't help, so we want to make sure that we're spending time with you and that we can help you and that you'll get a lot of value out of working with someone like us. And if not, keep showing up here. We're giving you so many templates and so much free resources. I wished all of this existed when I was looking, so it delights me that we're in a position that we can share this stuff with anybody that wants to find a business. I think it is an incredible path to ownership and entrepreneurship — much better than starting one in many cases. Thanks for your time today. We'll see you on the next one. Thank you so much. Take care.
