# Write-Up Guide

This document is different from the First Write-up guide; it focuses on how to handle ongoing write-ups. While the **[First Write-up document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SwYtdGGZnYXuLxRZ_hJ5wbWGK2ix9n9cWrrIXd2uKCg/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.ikbp0lmci9fv)** helps you get started and understand the process for your very first opportunity, this guide is about building consistency: reviewing new deals quickly, staying engaged with broker calls, and continuously developing your skills and confidence as a buyer.

## This Isn’t Just About *the* Deal, It’s About Building Your Dealmaking Muscles

Whether or not this particular opportunity is the one, the real value lies in the process.

Every time you review a write-up, engage with a broker, talk to an owner, or draft an IOI/LOI, you’re training your dealmaking muscles. You’re building confidence, sharpening instincts, and developing the skills that will set you apart when the right deal does come along.

*The people who go furthest are the ones who keep showing up, deal after deal, and take every opportunity to learn, adjust, and practice.*

Even when you’re unsure about a deal, go as far as you can. Each round makes you better at:

* Positioning yourself to brokers as the ideal buyer  
* Verifying your concerns to hone your deal instincts  
* Navigating nerves  
* Building real rapport

You're not just evaluating deals, you’re becoming a better buyer.

## Every Write-Up is a Development Opportunity

Our most successful clients are those who treat each deal not just as a pass/fail outcome, but as a learning lab. They:

* Engage quickly and openly in Slack  
* Embrace every step as a growth opportunity  
* Lean into feedback, even when it’s challenging

Each write-up is a chance to practice. Each conversation is a step toward mastery. And each next step, even if it doesn't end in an offer, is still forward motion.

## You’re Gaining Traction

This is your time to build momentum, sharpen your instincts, and move closer to a successful acquisition.

We’re here to guide you, support you, and coach you through it all.

Let’s get to it, you’ve got this\!

# Ongoing Write-up Steps:

## Step 1: Sign the NDA

Every deal starts with signing a new NDA. Even if you’ve signed others before, a new one may be required for each broker.

Each NDA Process differs with every broker so the team may send you a PDF to be signed, or the broker will send you an NDA directly.  

Here is the document if you need a recap on 

* [**LET'S SIGN AN NDA \- Google Docs**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1L0KOtb_dC4wyciZC1Y7_UAuwyI00eQeJwJt084FBvPU/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.tg7sxomw35l5)  
* [**LET'S SIGN A BUYER PROFILE \- Google Docs**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tFqUIDhlhG2bSw5o88Oh5EV2BEAsPEFdUxAOJdb2ZP8/edit?tab=t.rw8kqbmpbsbf)

**Action**: 

1. Return the NDA within 24 hours of being notified that a write up is ready.  
2. Drop the signed document in Slack, in the appropriate deal thread (or in the method directed by our team)  
3. Let us know you have signed the NDA in case the broker sent you the NDA directly.

## Step 2: Review the Write-Up & Prepare for Your Broker Call

Once you've either sent us the signed NDA or notified us that it has been signed directly with the broker, we’ll share your write-up with you in Slack.

Take the time to read through it thoroughly and begin preparing for your broker call:

* **Review the write-up** carefully and reflect on:  
  * Your overall interest in the deal  
  * Any red flags or concerns  
  * Questions you'd like to ask the broker. This is your “Talk Track”. Here is a list of questions you can choose from: [Questions for Brokers](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1l74nSRRl_bwNlIFGG9QVGE6xRFddbqS9DLa3SdwhHKQ/preview?tab=t.0#heading=h.h0kdp9wkpu30)

* **Think through your positioning.**  
  This is your chance to demonstrate that you’re a credible, serious buyer, not just to gather information. Be clear, confident, and intentional in how you show up on the call.

#### **Actions:**

1. Post your feedback (interest level, red flags, questions) in your Slack channel within 24 hours  
2. Share your planned talk track or broker questions for us to review  
3. You can share this in any format that works for you: a message, a voice note, or a short video  
4. Let us know when your broker call is scheduled, so we can follow up with you after.

## Step 3: Broker Introduction

Once you've reviewed the write-up, received feedback from the team on your talk track, and are ready for an introduction, we’ll move forward with introducing you to the broker via email. This introduction will include your buyer profile and a brief background to position you effectively. 

**Note:** Once we’ve made an introduction, you will be the main point of contact for the broker and seller on the opportunity. We will support and advise you, but you’ll be in the driver’s seat on the deal going forward. 

**Action**: 

* Schedule your broker call ASAP to avoid losing momentum. Please respond to the email thread where you are introduced to the broker within 24 hours.    
* Notify us in your Slack channel once your broker meeting is scheduled so we can follow up with you.

**Top Tip:** While broker communication will happen via email, please keep the AcquiMatch team CC’d on those threads. This helps us stay in the loop, track progress, and offer timely support if needed. **However, all internal conversations and updates should stay in Slack.** That’s our central hub for collaboration, and it ensures the right team member can respond quickly and keep everything organized.

## Step 4: Attend the Broker Call

Never skip this step, even if you're unsure of whether an opportunity is a good fit for you. Every broker call is a valuable learning opportunity that strengthens your deal instincts and sharpens your positioning.

### Why This Step Matters:

* **Clarify Key Assumptions:** Speaking directly with the broker or owner allows you to validate (or correct) assumptions you’ve made from the CIM or write-up.  
* **Uncover Insights Not in the CIM:** You’ll often learn details about the business that aren’t captured in the materials, things that can make or break your interest.  
* **Practice Buyer Positioning:** These calls help you build confidence, refine your narrative, and present yourself as a credible and qualified buyer to get access to the seller and move forward on an opportunity.

**Top Tip:** Always end the call with clear, agreed-upon next steps. Whether that means submitting an LOI, an IOI, or ideally moving forward to a seller call, momentum matters.

The goal is progress, not perfection. Every call builds your capability and confidence, making you better positioned for the next deal.

## 

## Step 5: Post-Call Feedback

Right after your broker call, hop into Slack and share your immediate thoughts. This helps us stay aligned and guide you through your next move.

**ACTION (in Slack):**

* **Tell us what happened**  
  * How did the call go?  
  * What questions were answered clearly, or left vague?  
  * What did you learn that wasn’t in the CIM?  
* **Share your takeaways**  
  * What did you like or dislike about the business or the broker?  
  * What concerns came up?  
  * What are you feeling excited or unsure about?  
* **Clarify next steps**  
  * Did you agree on a follow-up? Seller call?  
  * Is more information coming?


**Choose any format that works best for you:** Text, voice note, or a quick screen-recorded video, whatever helps you communicate clearly and quickly.

## Step 6: Navigating What Comes Next

After your broker call, the next step can vary depending on the broker’s process, the level of competition, and the stage of the deal. Some steps may happen in a different order than expected.

#### **Possible Scenarios:**

* **Seller Call as the Next Step:**  
  In most cases, you’ll move directly to a call with the owner. We’ll help you prepare your questions and positioning ahead of that conversation.

* **IOI Before Seller Call:**  
  Some brokers may request an IOI / LOI before granting access to the owner, especially if competition is high or they’re vetting serious buyers early.

* **Start Financial Modeling Early:**  
  If you’re strongly considering the deal or know you’ll need to submit an LOI soon, begin financial modeling as early as possible. It’ll give you a clearer sense of what you can offer and strengthen your positioning.

#### **Keep in Mind:**

* Broker processes differ, some are formal and structured, others are more flexible.  
* Timelines can shift depending on how many buyers are in the mix and how far along those other buyers are.  
* The more prepared you are (modeling, talk track, questions), the more confident and compelling you’ll be as a top choice. This comes with practice.

We’ll guide you based on what the broker asks for, just keep us updated in Slack as things develop, and we’ll support you every step of the way.

## Step 7: Preparing for the Owner Call

Once you’ve had a successful broker call and shown strong interest, the next goal is to get introduced to the owner. **Reminder:** The broker is just the gatekeeper, your real goal is to build rapport with the owner.

Positioning Yourself as the Ideal Buyer, Use the owner call to:

* **Build a connection** and establish trust  
* **Demonstrate your fit** for the business and your commitment to a smooth transition  
* **Understand their motivations** and show that you’re aligned with their goals  
* **Decide if you like the owner** and could see yourself continuing a relationship.   
* **If you’re seriously interested, suggest meeting in person**, this can go a long way in competitive situations

How to Prepare: Use the [**Owner Questions Resource**](https://www.notion.so/acquimatch/Seller-Meeting-Questions-Full-List-b8274e16bf804c2a81630e38c5db2b89?source=copy_link) and the [**Buyer-Seller Relationship Guide**](https://www.notion.so/acquimatch/Seller-Mindset-Context-Process-15ac367030c980c8b1c3f8a1bddab243?source=copy_link) to craft thoughtful, relevant questions

**Actions:**

* Post your 5–10 owner call questions in Slack ahead of the meeting so we can give you feedback  
* Let us know the **date and time of the call** so we can support you before and follow up after.


## Step 8: Post-Call Feedback

Right after your owner call, hop into Slack and share your immediate thoughts. This helps us stay aligned and guide you through your next move.

**ACTION (in Slack):**

* **Tell us what happened**  
  * How did the call go?  
  * What questions were answered clearly, or left vague?  
  * What did you learn that wasn’t in the CIM?  
* **Share your takeaways**  
  * What did you like or dislike about the business or the owner?  
  * What concerns came up?  
  * What are you feeling excited or unsure about?  
* **Clarify next steps**  
  * Did you agree on a follow-up?  
  * Is more information coming?


Choose any format that works best for you: Text, voice note, or a quick screen-recorded video, whatever helps you communicate clearly and quickly.
