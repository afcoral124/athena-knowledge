0:00 - AcquiMatch Team
  Oh, great.

0:02 - Luke Gillespie
  It's off.

0:05 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  She I really like her.

0:07 - AcquiMatch Team
  Yeah, it's nice.

0:09 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  She's a she's a very different vibe from a bias. But I have no filter and he's a super direct and she's just like wonderful to deal with and like she's really good at, you know, following up and understanding things and that sort of thing.

0:27 - AcquiMatch Team
  So nice, nice, nice work. Work around, get her to do it.

0:32 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  She actually, the bias wasn't available. you know, she suggested it, but she's I think the one that's that's kind of she's the onka over there, right?  the ops manager, like getting everything done. So yeah, she's good. the more I think about it, just watching Joe go through this process and what Wendy did with the 85%.  I'm like them having a broker while we get better at being able to broker ourselves. This is not. That's a lot.

2:02 - AcquiMatch Team
  Ten of them, ten of ten of them, ten of that? Eight?

2:07 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  I think it was like 80 to 100. It was exceptionally high.

2:13 - AcquiMatch Team
  Wow. That's cool.

2:18 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Oh, what'd you learn, Luke?

2:22 - Luke Gillespie
  I thought it was really interesting seeing how she chops it around right with multiple lenders, because the way I've seen it is Jason and Joe kind of going to lenders directly, and understanding the process of this loan broke ribs is interesting.  Yeah.

2:38 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  They do the shopping for, kind of like what we do for looking for deals, you know?

2:44 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah. And it showed us kind of what a good job we're doing, because everything, all the tips and advice she tried to tell our buyers, I was like, on, we already told them that.

2:53 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  I did try to, I gave her a goal run down.

2:57 - Luke Gillespie
  I'm like, they know all that, so like they weren't going do that stuff.

3:00 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  You know, I guess you can't say it enough times though, especially like we know it backwards and forwards, but our clients haven't gone through the starting process yet.

3:10 - Luke Gillespie
  Like, hasn't really hit until it's like active.

3:13 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So now that Steven Polly, I don't know where that got you, but we'd love an update. So I know we're running in a little bit late.  So yeah, where are we at with all the clients, deals also am off next week. So now is your time to grab me for things if you need them.

3:37 - AcquiMatch Team
  Well, let's start with the processes and then we'll go to deals. So yeah, me and David actually had a good call for this that was kind of built off of call that me and Luke had before.  And so, you know, we identified some areas of opportunity that we can improve on the process, a lot of which actually Athena, we've kind of we brainstormed  uh, last week about last Friday, so, um, the deals coming in, David's doing a great job of processing deals are the amount of deal flow we have is on way up.  Um, however, the amount of Sims we were getting out was down. So started with Luke. We had him talked about that.  Um, first thing is, we're like, we need to get more broker calls, right? Um, it's just too much for Luke to be going back and forth, back and forth, back and forth.  So we have to helping. Oka was right. She loves doing that. She loves setting up the calls. It gives her energy.  She got how many calls for you yesterday? Five years.

4:39 - Luke Gillespie
  Great. I had five calls yesterday. have four calls tomorrow trying to get a fifth one as well.

4:44 - AcquiMatch Team
  So, so already that is like doubling our broken calls. Okay. So that's good. Um, then, uh, there was a little bit of also, like me and  Look, looking at some of the deals and kind of just being like, Hey, this is good enough to do it right up.  Um, and the reason, the thing is, is that, you know, with Luke doing it all by himself, he's trying, he was trying to pick the perfect deal to do the call so that he's not wasting the time, right?  So the way for, to free up some of his times, just have, you know, book the deals, he doesn't have to think about it.  He just needs to make, he just needs to be productive on the calls and all those are going to flip his way, right?  So instead of a 90% success rate, we're going down to more like 50, 60, right? That's going to get us more right ups.  Um, then before that, how those actual deals get to Luke, um, we have this priority system, high, medium, low.  Um, so right now, the idea is, is that if something is a perfect fit for something, for a customer, it comes in, it needs to be processed over some time.  that's a so-so. That needs to happen. We have to prioritize that way, whereas we're going to lose deals. So we started this system, high, medium, low.  The problem is that we're kind of working the high medium only because like that's how much time in the day has been available for EDA.  So we said we need more. These are deals we're missing. So now we're moving David into that process and he's going to help process that.  And that's actually what he was just spent the last hour doing is helping clear those through. And David looks at the point that he thinks that we can actually clear that up.  It's just, it's still a backlog because of this new system. It's not going to take three weeks. going to take a little bit longer than that.  But we're putting systems in place to help that flow. So we're going to get to the point where David's processing the deals.  He is moving them through there. If there's a day that she stuck, David immediately jumps in, and pushes those through.  So that's something we're working on right now, so even though we're getting tons of deals and it coming through, they're kind of just getting stuck.  So that's one of the issues that we're working on. And then from the top of the funnel, which is where David is putting businesses into the pipeline and marking them high, medium, low, although me and David have a week to call where we're going to be reviewing those together, and so I can help him identify.  If I agree that's a high, I agree that's a medium. I agree that's a low and help them make adjustments to some things that may filter out businesses.  I just won't even let it into the beginning or help prioritize more a high versus medium so that Luke can see it as fast as possible.  A good one that we talked about today is that we are marking a lot of deals medium or low for Joe because they're not a direct hit.  What we're talking about now is like if Joe's deal flow is low and it's. someone who's range market high so that we can see it.  So the thing, the goal is to make everything visibility very clear for Luke, so that he can focus his time not on digging and just broker calls processing, broker calls processing.  I think we're getting a lot closer there.

8:22 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Sounds like good stuff. This makes me happy because there's temporary bottlenecks and things as we go through this process and it feels like we're closer and closer to just seeing what the system can do once we remove those temporary bottlenecks and everybody just gets in their flow.  what does it actually look like? So awesome. Sounds like y'all have been doing some good work and getting through all that.

8:48 - AcquiMatch Team
  So that's exciting. Good. Yeah, and I mean, let's just start with Luke. mean, you're having a great day, right?

8:56 - Luke Gillespie
  So why don't you start there, Luke? Yeah, so I wanted to give you an update. Athena, let's see, update just since last, last zero view call, last deal review call, we got out three write-ups, I got one for JG, one that I, I really like, I'm excited about it.
  SCREEN SHARING: Luke started screen sharing - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/258092956?timestamp=554.216837  I got one for Destin and Lindsey, and then I got one for Jason as well. so now, I want to go over, right, because we know you're going to be gone next week, so you want visibility and make sure that everything's going to go right end of month that we get enough write-ups as we need to.  So, I wanted to sort of show you all the deals I'm looking at and where we're at with, with each client, and if that's what you'd like, unless you'd like to talk about something else?

9:34 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  No, go for it. love it. I'm coming for the agenda, so I don't have to come up with one.

9:40 - Luke Gillespie
  Okay, so for Destin and Lindsey, as I said, I got that right about today. So there are number one priority right now, we are, we have to meet two minimum for them by the end of the month.  So I got that one today, and then I still have this one where we're supposed be waiting for a Q and V report.  This is going to be our last resort. in case if we have to, we'll push it for a write up with a big areas of clarification waiting on those 2024 actual numbers.  There's also this kind of low priority recruitment business he was trying to give me a call with them. There's, yeah, then these are just really low quality deals as the the deals go further.  So if any of the clients should should be worried about right now, it's DL. But I see in the previous and received stage on HubSpot, there's a bunch of deals piled up back then back there.  And if I really need to, I'm going to go back there and just start calling brokers. And Ryan knows that we him and I can do this, you can kind of just call a broker and get a SIM, hop on a call and turn it into a write up in a day.  That's very doable. So that's going to be the plan for DL if nothing comes up, right? But we did get them that one right up today.  So that's DL. Let me get into CM. So CM just revived an old deal. That we had given him before it.  uh, paint stripes, like a paint, uh, parking lot, painting company that paints the lines in the parking lot, big company, large SDE, uh, Chris, Chris had lost out to a cash buyer, but that cash buyer, as usual, these, these brokers have all these really good cash offers, but then they never fall through the offer always falls through.  And so Chris is back in the mix. He's submitted an IOI. So we're, we want to meet his middle of two by the end of the month, but we really need to just get him at least one because he did kind of have that one revived.  So there are multiple businesses in the mix. I have a call on this roofing business tomorrow. So I'm planning on this turning into a write up.  The reason I didn't make it. Sorry.

11:39 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  The one that came back online. Did we get that back online or did Chris get get it back online.

11:46 - AcquiMatch Team
  So the broker reached out to Chris via email.

11:51 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay, so we can't count that as a write up for the month because that didn't come from us.

11:57 - AcquiMatch Team
  Correct.

11:58 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Now. I'd like Luke was saying this counts as one, so I just want to make sure that we understand what counts as a write up and what doesn't.

12:07 - AcquiMatch Team
  Right. No, good point. And to build on that just a little bit, I did do a call with them.  We spent about 30 minutes, 20, 30 minutes talking through this specifically. He drafted up an IOI on this business, I marked it up completely different, he drafted up, sending it 20% seller note and 10% under offer, I said, send a full listing offer, like, if you want to get to the next stage, he didn't make it to the next get fit.  They're trying to determine who's going to make the next call, just get in the next call. So we're, we're, I was like, let's get more aggressive here.  You know, you've lost out on a few deals, you're submitting below offer, like, we need to to get past that.  This is one of the ones we lost on. Let's not lose it again. And he took that pretty well.  So we drafted up a new I.O.I. and are submitting on that to hopefully get them on a call. So we're working it, right?  You know, we're involved in it.

13:16 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Got it. And we're doing an I.O.I.

13:18 - AcquiMatch Team
  because he required the broker requested new sets of I.O.I.s before he determines who he's going to do calls with.

13:25 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay. Yeah. Well, get aggressive on the I.O.I.

13:28 - AcquiMatch Team
  because it means nothing. Exactly.

13:31 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah. Got it. Okay. I hear what you're saying. I'd still like, if we were the ones that brought it back online, then then I would count that.  So like, even though we're doing work on it, I'd still like to see us get to what we would deem reps to Chris.  So we're hitting those.

13:48 - AcquiMatch Team
  Yeah. I agree.

13:52 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Cool. That's a really cute name. Smarty plants.

13:57 - Luke Gillespie
  Oh, I know. This is for a destined. And Lindsey, it's like a, a plant shop.

14:03 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Oh, I could see them doing that.

14:06 - Luke Gillespie
  It's right in their hometown too, like their exact city.

14:11 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Oh, cool. So this, this is going to be a write up.

14:15 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah, I'm, they just signed the NDA. I'm going present to them by the end of tonight.

14:20 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Oh, nice. Oh, this feels like, I mean, I know nothing about it, but that gives me the little, little tingle, a little bit.  I don't know if I've had that on any of the deals we've signed yet.

14:31 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah, I'm excited for this one. The broker is saying they, if they're from the area, they've probably seen it before, it's off the freeway or whatever.  it's like an older married couple. So I was like, oh, I got a younger married couple. Maybe they'll see their younger selves and then blah, blah, Right.  But yeah, so Chris got a lot in the mix. know how Chris is. Um, so I'm sure we could get him to write up.  This one is this roofing repair business in Colorado. I'm busy as Colorado. I have a call tomorrow morning. Um, they're, they're doing big.  big SDE numbers nowadays with the pricing, they're going to have 536k SDE for Chris. So it's good. The only reason I didn't put it as a write-up immediately is their years like three, four years ago, we're kind of lower so they've grown to get to where they are today.  But end of the month, we're going to have to push what we have to Chris. This is an interesting one as well.  The numbers look good on it. think he said for Chris, he would like a little bit more, but he'll have 348k SDE and they like manufacture the cardboard boxes for, right, they manufacture boxes, retail packing supplies, gift boxes, kind of interesting.  So we're working on that. This is a flooring company as well, just good numbers, just trying to get a call with the broker, but this broker kind of led me on before, so I'm not putting a whole lot on this one.  I have, oh, Eda must have just added a note that this one went under contract, so that's not viable anymore, okay?  Um, this one, this is a absentee med spa. So zero hours being spent by the owner. Um, so it's only making 246 K for Chris, but it's absent zero hours.  Um, as usual, South Florida, the med spa capital of the world. I've seen so many med spots for, for, uh, and Lindsey didn't.

16:19 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So why, why is this a crystal and not a deal?

16:22 - Luke Gillespie
  Um, well, we could do that. We, the Ryan's thinking, and we thought we just gave them a med spa on the last deal and they were not really excited about that.  Ryan's not really feeling that. But, um, I mean, I guess we could, we should, Ryan, don't think we should make this a last resort just in case we have nothing by the end of next week.

16:43 - AcquiMatch Team
  Yeah, I, the feedback I gave today is I don't want to give them a med spa on the next business.  They didn't show a lot of interest and we haven't really got them a direct hit. This plant business that we're deciding to get them, it's right down the street from their house.  It's making a ton of money. The only thing is It's like around a 5x. So what we're going to do is say, hey, let's investigate how set they are on that.  But this is a great business making the money they want down the street. The objective is to find out, you know, are they willing to come down?

17:16 - Luke Gillespie
  know, seeing.

17:18 - AcquiMatch Team
  So we went with that.

17:20 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  They'll have to. No, but it's trading into 5x for that little SDE.

17:25 - Luke Gillespie
  So, I talked to the broker their prices BS. They're including $750,000 inventory in that price of 3.4 million. So I subtracted that 750k and then just did a 4x multiple of the SDE, which still is kind of high.  But it is. It's like an absentee business. They have a peak around Mother's Day and then they just go travel in the summer months.  They operate it remotely. have an extremely well built out team that the sim literally gives you like a resume of basically every employee here.

17:59 - AcquiMatch Team
  this is one. I'm like, they're going to, in my opinion, they're going to be excited about seeing this and then we're going to have to work on willing and talking about.  And so we're going to get further down the line, I think, on this one, which is what I want.  And then the second one, the one you were discussing before that, they're still waiting on the Q and E.  My idea is just like, let's just get it to them and be like, we're introducing this opportunity. They're still working through it, but get your name in the conversation.  We'll get you another one soon. And now they're in the conversation, they're speaking with the broker. It looks like a good opportunity.  We're just waiting on these, this new clear earnings going through. But I don't want us to like, sit back waiting on that.  So that will get us like in this next two weeks, get them to quality businesses. If we don't have anything after that, then we can fall back on another med spa.  But this med spa is worse than the one that we got before. So it's like, it's not what I would like to lead with.  So I think we have better opportunities to get in front of them before that. So we can just put this in our back pocket for now.

18:59 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Thank gosh. And Why a med spa for Chris?

19:03 - Luke Gillespie
  Hmm. He has it listed as something he's open to. I mean, medspas are just a very hot industry. think everyone in the ETA search or space kind of things of medspas.  And it's an opportunity. Chris likes that he is kind of looking for something where he can eventually have an operator in.

19:25 - AcquiMatch Team
  And this is also option like what? Number three or four.

19:30 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah. This is a far down option for Chris.

19:33 - AcquiMatch Team
  think you're, I think we can move on from Chris and move on to somebody else. think we're, I mean, we got a hundred deals.  could go through all of them and show Athena focus on the stuff that's like more.

19:42 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, I agree.

19:45 - Luke Gillespie
  I have a call for a guild tomorrow. This is the business he specifically requested. broker hasn't given me the same yet.  He said they're updating 2024 numbers, but I just, I just soft him and found his link and book to call tomorrow.  So I'm just going to talk to him tomorrow. And then I also have a. Paul tomorrow for a screen printing company from Chris for for, sorry, for Gil, excuse me.

20:07 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Hey, can you do me a favor?

20:09 - Luke Gillespie
  Uh huh.

20:10 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Can you just give me a beat after you talk through a deal?

20:14 - Luke Gillespie
  Sorry. Yeah.

20:16 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay. Um, Jeff Snell, why is that name familiar?

20:26 - Luke Gillespie
  You probably worked with him in the past.
  ACTION ITEM: Review past convos w/ Jeff Snell in HubSpot before tomorrow's call - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/258092956?timestamp=1231.9999

20:37 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Did you look at the past relationships and conversations?

20:42 - Luke Gillespie
  No, I forgot. would do that when I prepare him for the call tomorrow before the call.

20:47 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Got it. Okay. So you've got a call scheduled with him.

20:50 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah. So I do all my preparing before the call.

20:52 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So everything's fresh and I can bring it up. Can you scroll down to what I chatted with him about with the E.E.

21:11 - Luke Gillespie
  All right, you're inquired, he sent it over, okay, I'm asking questions about financial review. The listing has not been brought back on the market, the texting on the weekend.  Yeah, it's like they took it off the market and then you just said, okay, well, let me know if it comes back on these.  Hold me, I got my client looking for this. These amount of numbers in these areas. You followed up. Oh, wait, that's me.  Yeah, that's recently. Oh, wait, no, that was you last year in 2024. Yeah, you followed up and we news will be reviewing the TTM.  Follow up again. Has not come back on March.

22:00 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  It's okay. Cool. Thank you. Um, yeah, it was all Anka. wasn't me. You know, Anka. I was just like, the name sounds really familiar.  was just wondering if I got farther down the line.

22:16 - Luke Gillespie
  Okay. Sorry. Carry on. Okay. Yeah. this is one.

22:19 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  is digital transformation agency. Is this the same one? Because he's using the same words.

22:27 - Luke Gillespie
  Um, when you do your call, look into that.

22:36 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, it's exactly one.

22:38 - Luke Gillespie
  So what happened there?

22:49 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So then you can say that, say, you know, hey, I think Athena inquired about this for a different client.  looks like it went off and came back on.

22:57 - Luke Gillespie
  Like, what's going on with it? Yeah.

23:00 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah. Nice.

23:01 - Luke Gillespie
  Okay. Cool. All right. Carry on. Gotcha. Okay. Um, I believe. Yeah, this is one I was chasing, but it looks like they just went under contract.  So that's not viable anymore. Again, we have like last last resort for Gil. This is one. I'm not interested about it.  It's literally like marketing for Instagram, like helping influencers. It's like supposed to an AI that helps influencers with something.

23:26 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  I just look at this. was like, this is not Gil's business. Got it.

23:31 - Luke Gillespie
  This one. This is one that I had done the call before. So it's a million dollars SD and the broker was pretty firm that they want a five million dollar asking price.  And so this is when we weren't, I wasn't really looking at larger businesses for Gil. So this guy's pretty available and easy to hop on another call.  So I could always just hop back on this call. It's an IT company, but also they're looking for someone with more sales experience rather than technical.  The technical side of things is covered with this company that. Looking for someone with sales to grow the business.

24:02 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So that's why this wasn't that great of a fit, but always backup. could fall back on. Right. Okay. Thank you for the pause.

24:12 - Luke Gillespie
  Um, this is an electrical contractor, but it looks like the license. A big going to be an issue on this one, but I'm still going to try to get a call for it.

24:21 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay.

24:22 - Luke Gillespie
  Screen printing company I have a call tomorrow. Um, yeah.

24:29 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Like they manufacture screen printing.

24:32 - Luke Gillespie
  Green printing fly company. When we pull up this and.

24:37 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Oh, check the market trends on that one.
  ACTION ITEM: Research market trends for screen printing industry before write-up - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/258092956?timestamp=1479.9999

24:43 - Luke Gillespie
  Manufacturers high quality screen printing products, photo emosions, cytosoline, screen chemicals, soaps and adhesives.

24:49 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah.

24:50 - Luke Gillespie
  Just do the do a larger macro.

24:53 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Anything printing we need to be careful of because it's a dying industry. So, um, before. you hand something over on printing specifically, just make sure you check.  I don't know about screen printing if that's a dying industry, but just do a macro check on that one.

25:10 - Luke Gillespie
  Gotcha.

25:15 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay. It's really hard. So just to pull back and explain that one for everyone's benefit. It's one thing in the business is, you know, like the revenues are declining, but maybe it's a market that's stable or the market is growing.  So somebody could get in there and write the shift there. It's incredibly difficult to do that if the overall industry is dying.  the brokers in the Sim are going to be like, it's great, it's great, it's great. over here, you know, so we need to do kind of independent check when you know that it's an industry that is dying, right?  It's on the decline, printing is on the decline. Now, if you're telling me it's a print on demand business, and I'm like, okay, I'm listening now, like,  like, are they a supplier to Zazzle? does that look like, you know, or Canva, like all of these places are using third party printers to do that.  So some parts of the printing industry aren't necessarily dying, which is why we need to get specific. But when we come across an industry that the overall macro trends are that the industry is dying, then the business needs to have some moat or serious difference in which they're able to move against the tailwinds there, but even still, like what's the long term, like, you know, somebody's taking on a one for 10 years, what does that actually look like for them?  So being able to speak to that, just like with the tariffs and that sort of thing, like these are things that'll come up.  So it's better for us to kind of let's do a sense check and just see do we feel that this business has the opportunity to continue performing the way it has or even grow, because that's the ideal for a lot of our clients is they want to grow  But it's nearly impossible to grow a business in a dying industry, unless you have some crazy competitive advantage or, you know, you're working against the dying trend in some way that's special to that business.

27:15 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah, gotcha. point. And he was very hyper aware to those kinds of thoughts.

27:21 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  good point is and he's not necessarily in the like, like, he wants to get into a business and work on it.  But like, like, that kind of in a dying industry, it's gonna be 50, 60 hours a week or printing, as well as probably going to need to be on site, I don't know if it's remote, those sorts of things.  um, okay.

27:43 - Luke Gillespie
  I have a medical supply company. Um, it's a decent numbers, 425k is the E1.6 mil asking price. The one negative is there's like two owners that need to be replacement.  It looks like they have some significant roles, but still But things can always be worked around. So interesting.

28:03 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  It does not include the salary to hire to replace the I don't believe so. OK, that's a no-no. You know to check for that, right?

28:20 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah, of course. I always look at that.

28:25 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Where are the adbacks?

28:29 - Luke Gillespie
  Let me see.

28:37 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  OK, you don't need to do it here. But before you do write up, just check that SDE number. includes a firing or a salary adjustment.

28:53 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah. Yeah. OK, you can make an offer.

29:00 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  on that, right? But you pull down the SC, like we, we would have, it's make a SDE adjustment and say this is how, you know, the LOI, where the client needs to say how they're determining the number.  So it's like, I'll offer a 4X, but I'm saying that the SC is this number because I'm accounting for replacing a second owner.

29:21 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah. Yeah, Yeah. And I do mention red ops.

29:28 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Great. But yeah. like, just, but also when you have the conversation with the broker, like does the ad back include the second owner salary?  Or did they just not add back any salaries? And then in that case, the salaries accounted for. So you just want to double check that anytime there's multiple owners.  like, how is the salaries being looked at in the box and in the financials?

29:54 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah, exactly.

29:56 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Cool.

29:58 - Luke Gillespie
  All right. I have this as well. This is It's a company that manufactures like the down puffer jackets, those winter jackets.  This one, this broker is weird and doesn't have much information on it. so I've been waiting for him to get back to me and he just doesn't get back to me.  So I just have this one low, low priority just in case.

30:15 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  GPB, what did we work with them on?

30:18 - Luke Gillespie
  Oh, we work with them. We see a lot of deals from them.

30:21 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay.

30:24 - Luke Gillespie
  JQ, you worked with them.

30:30 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Is that, is that, is that the one that he went under offer on Ryan? Do you remember?

30:42 - AcquiMatch Team
  I can't remember.

30:47 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  The broker went directly to the, the, um, um, no, the distribution for the clean room business. I think that was Mark.

31:06 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah, it looks like we would get it done.

31:15 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  I think it was this guy. Okay.

31:21 - Luke Gillespie
  All right. This is an interesting one, manufacturer. Kind of looks like semiconductors with their manufacturing. This real electronic stuff.  don't believe I don't have a call schedule for this, but just interesting manufacturing company. Decent numbers, some consistency in revenue.  We'll drop an SDU here. Yeah. So I'm just waiting to try to get a call for this one.

31:57 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay. Sounds like you have a lot of good stuff for GL. Well, is there anything in particular you wanted to talk about with his steel's laughter?

32:03 - Luke Gillespie
  want to know? No, no, I'm confident with GL.

32:06 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Cool.

32:08 - Luke Gillespie
  So JB, we haven't gotten him any write-ups this month. That's because in the beginning of the month, he was handling both those two LOIs, they were right with those two companies.  And so he had told Ryan, Hey, like, if it's not like a really perfect fit, don't don't send me anything my way.  So we weren't searching as hard as we would have. And then a week ago or so, he told Ryan on a call, now that that other deal fell through, he asked Ryan, like, Hey, well, anything coming up in the pipeline.  So we're trying to get a get a write-up for him, right? So contractual minimums would be the two write-ups, but he had kind of told us to slow down in the beginning.  So we weren't searching as hardcore. So we're trying to get him one write-up, at least by the end of the month.  But obviously we would love to get to Luke. Yeah.

32:55 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, we got to stop talking like that.

32:58 - Luke Gillespie
  Oh, I'm never going

33:00 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  going to be okay with us not meeting our minimums.

33:02 - Luke Gillespie
  Okay.

33:03 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So I need to sign off if we're going to not deliver on minimums to a client. So he's saying he doesn't want to get like a high volume of deals, but we need to get it in writing from the client that they are approving.  Right. And so unless we have that, we are not taking the gas off for any clients.

33:24 - Luke Gillespie
  Okay.

33:26 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So I know this come up a lot. I just the way the way you talk about it, you know, words are important, right?  Because that's going to affect how you're actually living deals for clients. So unless we have it in writing from a client, I have approved it and I've said, yes, we're not we're not providing two deals to the client this month, then assume we are still processing those deals and looking for them.  What Joe said was don't just send me anything. I want to make sure that it's it's a good direct hit.

33:57 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah.

33:59 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So we're not taking the foot off the Yes, we're still reviewing all the deals, but we're being a little bit more discerning about what we put through.

34:06 - Luke Gillespie
  Oh.

34:07 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  That do you understand? the way you were talking about it, we're not looking at all. Um, we're still looking.  We're not stopping. We're doing everything that we would normally, but we're more discerning about what we put in front of him.  And if we're going to do less than the minimum, we need to get that signed off at the beginning of the month.

34:26 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah, understood.

34:28 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Cool.

34:31 - Luke Gillespie
  I have a call for this construction contractor tomorrow. It's in Hillsborough County. Um, the license is just the issue.  I was always with a business like this, but the broker's open minded. He says, I, I'm happy to put anything in front of my client, his seller.  So we're going to work on that tomorrow. I have this, uh, very low SDE damage restoration business. Um, as a as a some backups.

35:02 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  I love restoration, especially in Florida.

35:08 - Luke Gillespie
  Okay.

35:10 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Why do you think that is?

35:12 - Luke Gillespie
  Because they have a lot of  that needs restoring so many storms and problems like that.

35:17 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  And also why we love roofing in Florida as well. Right. And restoration can be highly, it can be an amazing business for someone with strong sales skills.  Because where do the restoration jobs typically come from? Where do they get a lot of their leads?

35:37 - Luke Gillespie
  From like disaster areas that have been struck by a hurricane.

35:44 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  But who calls them to say, I need you to come and look at this.

35:48 - Luke Gillespie
  Oh, like an individual homeowner. And then Joe would want to show up and sell them on how bad the mold is or something like that.

35:58 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So with with. these kinds of things, it's very, very relationship based. a lot of the referrals will come from plumbers, they'll come from mitigation companies, they will come from insurance companies.  with Joe's skill set, right, and like creating those relationships and those referral agreements, I feel like, and Ryan correct me if I'm wrong, but I feel like he also has experience in the family or with someone with restoration.

36:30 - AcquiMatch Team
  I think he does have something like that. Yeah, I think we should be like a little back in the day when he was like, maybe out of high school or something like that, but he does know a little bit about something like that.

36:44 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So I would, I would, even though the SD is low, these kinds of businesses, and this is what Renan's into, right, and he's making a play where he's buying them all over the country.  But you get a good relationship with insurance brokers or insurance folks and that sort of thing. like, like, so I'd be interested in like, how much of that are they actually doing?  That's Joe's whole world is getting on the road, relationships, sales, that sort of thing. So there might be a really big opportunity here, but I love restoration.  Because there's always going to be work to be done, especially in Florida.

37:19 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah. Yeah. And this owner, like, hurt his back or something. And so he's being forced to sail. So maybe that that's like, that could be like a skillset.

37:33 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  He just, he just closed on it two months ago.

37:37 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah, I guess so. Let me see.

37:44 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Go back down to old fire damaged restoration, 13 years established, which is tons of potential. So why?

37:54 - Luke Gillespie
  Huh, that's interesting. Yeah. Interesting.

37:59 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  I like, I like. restoration and mitigation. I also know I have good contacts there in the consulting project that none of you luckily were exposed to, but it was absolutely phenomenal.
  ACTION ITEM: Call Dave re: fire damage restoration business for Joe; get write-up details - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/258092956?timestamp=2287.9999

38:12 - Luke Gillespie
  all was a restoration business, I have a lot of experience in this area too. Interesting.

38:20 - AcquiMatch Team
  So this is Dave. This is the one that we just fell out of with the playground business.

38:25 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  This Dave was working with that.

38:27 - AcquiMatch Team
  So you can literally just call him easy. Just be like, hey, what's the loadout on this? You could get it right up on this in an hour.

38:35 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah. Yeah.

38:38 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  And they have a relationship. Yeah, I love it.

38:40 - Luke Gillespie
  All right. Then we got this, like, hopefully two right after Joe right there.

38:47 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Great. Nice work.

38:49 - Luke Gillespie
  Okay. As far as I'm getting tingly about restoration.

38:54 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  I don't know why there's something there's some previous conversation or something, or maybe just I know how Absolutely phenomenal.  It can be as a business because also you can add in so like the business that I was doing the crazy deal on They added in storage Because when people need to get their homes remodeled and restored they need to store their stuff somewhere So they added storage as a and it increased their revenue by 25 It was  crazy Interesting, it's like a lot of really cool things and there's a restoration membership Network here in Austin and I went with Renan when Renan was becoming a member and the guy is super excited about what we do And so could put Joe in touch with them um And I just feel like Joe has there's something Joe said in the past or he just liked Renan's business model or something like that.  So I would yeah and you have a relationship with the broker That sounds like a good one

40:06 - Luke Gillespie
  All right. I will pursue that. next, home builder general contractor is kind of weird. asking for a 50% partnership at 400k, but then it says it's negotiable, no good fillable.  So I kind of just priced it at 100% for 800k. that's what the numbers look like for Joe. So this is most likely a big pass on the ceiling.

40:27 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, that sounds like a problem.

40:30 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah.

40:31 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  They want a capital injection that business is usually in a problem state. How does Joe feel about construction?

40:37 - AcquiMatch Team
  He's open to construction.

40:39 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay. GC though, there'll be some licenses involved on this one to imagine.

40:49 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah, there are always is. I'll have to email him back later. And this one, believe, right?

40:59 - AcquiMatch Team
  This is a duplicate of what he was just working on, right? Project innovations. Yeah.

41:03 - Luke Gillespie
  Okay.

41:04 - AcquiMatch Team
  So you can mark it as duplicate.

41:06 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Did it come back online?

41:07 - AcquiMatch Team
  No, it just, it just sold. mean, it just sold, or it just went to a little while.

41:14 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  How, who did he lose it to again? I'll cash.

41:18 - AcquiMatch Team
  Oh, cash is what he said. And then we, when we dug it, asking why it was all more stuff about being all cash.

41:28 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Luke, why don't you do this when we're done?

41:31 - Luke Gillespie
  Okay.

41:32 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Thanks.

41:33 - Luke Gillespie
  I'm pretty much done here. SPA have a call tomorrow and one on Monday. So I'll have a write up for them for sure.  The one on Monday, I'm pretty confident on. And then the only other client that needs write up is well, BH is only one left.  And because he kind of just came back to life, like a few days ago, we're planning on getting him one write up, an online business probably, because that's what he told Ryan, he's gonna be  do so? Well, we'll get his gauge on how he feels about an online business.

42:04 - AcquiMatch Team
  I also, I, I said, I just, I was very upfront with him. Um, and just told them like, Hey, you haven't been answering the things we've gotten you.  You haven't been responding. You know, I've asked you to kind of do this and you haven't been able to do it.  You know, like what can we do to make that happen? So, um, you know, he told me, you know, we can, he was like, can we talk through email?  was like, we can send you the writeups in the NDA through email if that's what you prefer, but the communication has to happen on Slack.  And so he was like, okay, um, that's fine. Um, then I told them, I said, you know, you're telling you want this, you want this, you want this, you know, that's not going to be able to do two per month.  Uh, we'll, we'll work and get you things. isn't fit. What you're looking for, but I can't guarantee two per month on that.  That's something different from when you told us initially. And he was like, Okay, so I, I, he knows. was very good at writing.  We sent him an update. I had eat a update, like, here's what you're looking for again, like here's based on your conversation.  But it didn't say in their minimums have changed. But I have the recording.

43:32 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, get it in writing, please. Just say like, just confirming you understand that we will not be able to meet your minimum.  Like, we may not be able to meet your minimums with all of these changes in the deal box. Also, we are going to, you know, you to do the things that we ask for to protect our relationships in order to keep providing you deals.

43:52 - AcquiMatch Team
  Got it.

43:53 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Cool. Did we talk to him about any services? think he's coming up on six months. So he's going to start getting a monthly charge soon.

44:06 - AcquiMatch Team
  Is he coming up on six months?

44:09 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah. Do they need to give 30 days notice? So he his April 1st will be his like final month.  Almost positive. Can you check that with Anka, please?

44:24 - AcquiMatch Team
  Yeah.

44:26 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  But like get him to confirm before 30 days. I'm assuming he's not going to want to start paying five grand a month too.  So and sorry, what about JJ and Jason and JG we they all have their minimums met? Is that what happened?  Yeah, they all already have two setups. OK, but we're not stopping looking at opportunities for

45:01 - Luke Gillespie
  Well, for the next week, we're going to have to scramble and prioritize for these minimums.

45:06 - AcquiMatch Team
  We're processing all clients all the time, but we have to prioritize our time with the clients that need to hit the minimum.  So everything is still moving, flowing as normal.

45:20 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay. But if one comes through, it's like this could be the one we're not exercising on it.

45:27 - AcquiMatch Team
  It gets marked high priority and that'll be in front of Luke.

45:30 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay. Luke, you understand that you still need to work those.

45:36 - Luke Gillespie
  Okay. We'll do.

45:38 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay. you didn't understand that then.

45:43 - Luke Gillespie
  Okay. Now I do.

45:44 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah. Okay. I guess to give you some context and why we're trying to get out of this high priority client thing, right?

45:51 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah.

45:51 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  It's the perfect deal comes through from one of those clients and we don't process it because we're doing this, this client's the priority thing, then we've lost an opportunity that might be their one or putting them at a disadvantage because we're deprioritizing it because, you know, so like, we know time is of the essence on market.

46:13 - Luke Gillespie
  So that's why I'm asking that and why I want us to stop this priority client thing.

46:18 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  It's like, if it could be the one for them, then we need to be processing not just the same as anyone else.

46:25 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah, I understand.

46:30 - AcquiMatch Team
  So if it's the one, right, so if it comes up and it's the one, that's why it needs to get our time priority and you need to review it because if it's the one, we got to push it forward, right?  But if you have 100 things to look at and that's not possible to process, we have to have some type of prioritization method.  Right now currently, it's that we have one week left and we need to hit minimums for all these clients.  So, the prioritization method they were using that starts with David is focused on marking things high that we need to work on right now and so as long as you follow the prioritization everything should happen so it starts with David right so David sees something perfect that comes through for DL we already have two write-ups for DL but it's not high that means you look at it if it's good we do write-up yeah all right cool awesome okay um good anything more on your stuff Luke you're sounds like you're making a really good progress I love that Eda is getting bullish on booking you on calls because that'll make a huge difference too yeah I got nothing awesome cool um so client updates Ryan are we doing
  ACTION ITEM: Send personal msg to JQ re: status update - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/258092956?timestamp=2869.9999  Sure, actually before you I keep meaning to ask JQ if we've had an update or what the hell happened there I have I feel bad.  I think I haven't gone back to blessing either, which is totally  of me, but Maybe start shoot him a personal message yourself You know to see like hey, how's it going?  See what he says I Gave him the feedback, you know maybe He Didn't like some of the things I had to say so I don't know he hasn't you think you would have reached up to me by now and say Hey, I'm thinking this or that but he hasn't said anything so No, but he's not used us or Done anything to actually get advisement.  So exactly so it could just be how that's how he is So I can show a message or what do you think?

48:53 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Um, yeah, my only thing is I've got one more day.

48:58 - AcquiMatch Team
  Yeah, I I got it.

49:04 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Sweet. And then when I get back, if he hasn't responded, I'm happy to do that. I don't want him to respond while I'm away and may not catch it.

49:13 - AcquiMatch Team
  Yeah. Okay. So a I had my first education or call like the scheduled and went really well. you know, she just, I think she just likes having someone to talk to and us.  Still feel like she's progressing without the pressure like we discussed. So I think that's going well. I'm giving her a graph with the calls videos to watch things to prepare for.
  ACTION ITEM: Check w/ Anka re: BH contract end date; prep for potential monthly charge convo - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/258092956?timestamp=2975.9999  And then we go over it together. So that's going good. BH, I just checked. He did. He started December.  So we still have 60 plus days.

49:52 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So we're okay on him.

49:54 - AcquiMatch Team
  Um. Cm. We are. a great call yesterday where we spent a lot of time prepping for that, sending that I O I and then talking through this deal that we have for the Northeast, the big the big monster.  He's very excited about that. We have a call on Monday afternoon for the operations and financial questions and we're going to end it asking when we can fly out there and meet them.  That's the plan. Okay, Dio has been our kind of priority as of last week. Just had a lot of great deal flow, but Luke has kind of gone over that.  We've come up soon. I think some good options to get over to them. I'll be checking in with them about this like flower shop and try to push them and help them with that as it's a big one.  I feel good about that. We didn't get them many great deals at the beginning. So usually at this point, I'm like a little bit more removed and just letting them handle it.  But I'm going to jump back in with them and do calls and talk them through it to make them feel like they're still getting the service and personal touch.

51:14 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Right.

51:17 - AcquiMatch Team
  Um, GL, um, does really like that business. Um, still needs to hear back from that broker about, um, you know, if that's going to be a problem, that he's not boots on the ground.  Um, but I need to talk with him about that. See what's the latest of he, if he's heard back from the broker on that one.  JB doing good.

51:56 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Just on GL. If he loves that business. It's telling me to get on a plane. Like if he thinks he can make it work and they're like, oh, you're not here.  And be like, I'll come and meet you, you know? Like that shows a lot of commitment and gets a lot of reciprocity word of the month.  And he doesn't, he's not working or anything. So he has the time. So just like if he wants that business and he thinks he can do it, get on a plane.

52:28 - AcquiMatch Team
  Cool.

52:31 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Tell the broker, like that creates so much good will, I think, to just show how serious you are and just like, hey, I realize you're a little uncomfortable with this.  But if I came to you, we spent some time together, getting to know each other, you see how serious I am, how would that feel?  It's like, okay, you know, so.

52:50 - AcquiMatch Team
  Got it. Okay. JB doing good, still progressing with Pino. We just have like strategy calls me telling him like hey, it's mainly me just staying stay on him and like kind of managing that communication.  He does kind of tend to be like well he didn't do this and he didn't say that and I it's almost like always have to keep saying.  This is how it is he's going to be that way like don't take it the wrong way it's your job to keep pushing him forward to keep following them up to keep asking for the thing he needs.  I asked him I said hey ask him and say hey can I help you out maybe just I can work directly with your accountant if you'd like.  Pino said no no I got it you know but I'm just pushing JB we talk every Monday morning and I just push him to like keep up the communication keep the progression that kind of stuff.

53:44 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Well wait he's got term sheets now so what's he doing next.

53:49 - AcquiMatch Team
  Yeah so he hasn't decided on in terms of the term sheet of what to do. I mean, the thing with Wendy, it seems like, he was kind of leaning towards like, I think I'm going to work with Wendy because I've been working with Wendy and then he's he's gotten this 85% approval.
  ACTION ITEM: Follow up w/ Joe re: lender decision, underwriting process, QV start, due diligence checklist - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/258092956?timestamp=3253.9999

54:24 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  I wouldn't do it. So he was speaking to the other lender, asked them how they would handle the license.  If they've done HVAC deals, that was a work that I gave him. So check in with him and see if he did that, because at this stage, the next step is pick a lender, start the underwriting process, start a QV.

54:49 - AcquiMatch Team
  Yeah.

54:50 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  else does he need from, he doesn't need anything else for Pino at this point, because it's really on him to make a decision.

55:09 - AcquiMatch Team
  Yeah, yeah. I think he was maybe even kind of jumping ahead. We were talking about like vehicles and how the vehicles are and like stuff that like Wendy was prepping him for down the line.  So we were talking about that. So he's working on things, even though we didn't need that for the term sheet because she had kind of given him the stuff, get this, get this, get this.  And so he was already working on it. So me and we're talking through it. So it like, it was like, even though he didn't have the term sheet from her, we were talking about these other things that he needs to get from Pinot.  So that's what that's where we were.

55:42 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Mm hmm.

55:44 - AcquiMatch Team
  And then I brought that up to you and then you, you know, talked to Wendy and then we got the term sheet.

55:53 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  That's why I wanted it because it's a  offer.

55:58 - AcquiMatch Team
  Yeah, I did do a call with Wendy. And, um, college reated some of the things that me and you had discussed and she said that this thing is that's new to this year, the last year they were not doing this.

56:15 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Asking for 15%. Yeah, like it's, but this is why we go to different lenders and why we ask for term sheets before we like she was running Joe down the line.  He's running after the owner for , getting ahead of himself, you know, so it's like what he needs to do is decide a term sheet.  If he's not comfortable and maybe he wants to talk to Valerie and Matthias and just get someone else in his corner that's going to help him with this, um, go into underwriting, start his QV, look at the finances, make sure the finances are all there.  And then, you know, he's going to get his due diligence lists together from everyone. Like, has he got the insurance legal, everyone to give him the full list?  Does he have that? Do diligence checklist filled out? Is he using that? If not, like, stop, start project managing this, get an idea of what you need, what your next steps are, so you're not needlessly, like, giving the owner a fatigue on different parts of the process.  before you vetted that this is actually the one, you get a sense, like he's not fully sure that he wants it.  I'm also in his neck of the woods next week, so I'm going to be meeting with him regardless. I was like, and if you want me to come along to a meeting with Pino, I'm happy to do that too.  So I'm not, I'm trying to avoid doing work, but things keep cropping up. But, like, I was always planning on meeting with Joe anyway, just having a coffee or lunch because I've never actually met him in person.  And then I did say it was like, hey, if you want to meet a come along to a meeting, I'm happy to do that.  So just know that's in your back pocket. If you want to push him on that and have me there, if you think it would be helpful, because I  I think he's like, I got this, whatever. like, I agree.

58:04 - AcquiMatch Team
  think you're right.

58:05 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  I'll turn up in my Chuck Taylor's and jeans and try to tone down the brake colors to me to the HVAC guy.

58:16 - AcquiMatch Team
  Yeah, now that you even just talk about it, I'm just like going through the list. I kind of feel like I should be pushing him harder just because of where he's at in the process.  You know, I'm saying my piece and we're doing our routine and press him for it. But yeah, I just need to besides that, just be messaging.
  ACTION ITEM: Schedule call w/ Wendy; discuss term sheet process, 85-15 split, competitive positioning - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/258092956?timestamp=3517.9999  Did you get it done? Following it up? Did you do this, right? I'll stick on. I'll stay on him.

58:43 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, he's at the finish line.

58:46 - AcquiMatch Team
  Yeah.

58:48 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  But like Wendy, Wendy, that's a  offer. So glad you guys already had a call, but she needs to stop.  know, she's doing way too much work on all these deals. Like, she nearly killed that deal for Joe getting on the phone with the  brokers and everything before they even had an LOI in place.  tactfully, she's a friend, so I have to be careful, but you can tactfully give her that feedback and just be like, you seem like you end up causing delays when we're really just trying to get someone under offer.  And then after their under offer, we're trying to like, is this financeable so that her term sheets not coming forward, but it's like, other lenders are not doing this, right?  So if you want to be competitive and we love working with you, then we kind of need you to not slow our clients down.  You're on me. I can't, Ryan.

1:00:02 - AcquiMatch Team
  Sorry, I said I agree 100%.

1:00:06 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, so I think it would be better, honestly, because you don't have the personal relationship to just be like, hey, here's what I'm seeing.  It kind of feels like you're slowing things down a little bit. I know your intention is to get things like over the line, but just know this is the kind of process we walk them through.  And then we can all catch up after you're back. But we get so much value out of her for doing these pre-qualifications.  it drives me crazy that she might be losing business, but she's just running too far with it too early on.

1:00:42 - AcquiMatch Team
  Do you want me to do another call with her? it give her this feedback?

1:00:45 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  you already gave her her feedback, then great. not, feel free to have another one. think it's good for you to have close relationships with all these lenders anyway.  So just be like, hey, so what we typically you know, Pre-L-O-I, we just want them to make sure that, you know, the structure will work in theory.  We're not saying, you know, we're telling them it's just a term sheet of this, you know. So I don't even want her to look at, like, Pre-L-O-I anymore because of what she was doing, getting on the phone with the brokers and stuff.  It's like, it wasn't even under offer.

1:01:20 - AcquiMatch Team
  So it made her client look like they didn't know what they were doing. Yeah, so the feedback I gave her was she was like, look, I don't normally do this.  Like, I usually work the deal to the end and get it to like, like, don't do these little sheets that she was saying.  It's like, it really means nothing. And I go, okay, I got you. The thing, why it's effective for us is that we've had conversations with a seller, multiple conversations, explaining to them we plan to use as, yay, until we show them that we have like a term sheet and like, like, there's a lender,  It's gonna be working with us They don't know what to think so that helps us to show it to them be like we got a term sheet from Blender We need these things.  Let's go Instead of continuing to ask them with no proof that we're gonna get approved for an SBA. Well And so she was like, okay, I can do that.  So That was what I told you I would also be like dude other lenders are doing this.

1:02:28 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So I know it's it's different for you, but My advice if you want to be competitive is don't don't slow down the process and just manage people's expectations that It's a term sheet, you know and things could change, but Like I didn't say that part because of like the things that you've said about like like be careful about saying we're shopping or Never so like, you know, we know we send all our clients there.

1:02:56 - AcquiMatch Team
  So I was like, I don't know what to say here So I just left that part out.

1:02:59 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, so And rightly so. So say, Wendy, our clients aren't getting advice just from us. We can't stop them from going and speaking to other lenders and everybody is saying like you should go get multiple term sheets and also for the exact reason of what you guys came back with with Joe.  It's not a good deal for him to give up 15% ownership. So it is, it is good practice for people to make sure that they're, they're getting the best deal for them.  Now, you're preferred. We love you. We want everyone to close with you. But sometimes your bank is not the right bank for people.  And, you know, like, so it's a lot of work for you to find out that it's not going to be right either like Do it your own way and you could just be like ignorance on that part and just be like, look, our clients, they listen to the podcast.  lot of them are members of other masterminds like we can give them advice, but a lot of them have been told and want to get.  it multiple offers. So it'll save you the headache to just do the term sheet in the first instance.

1:04:06 - AcquiMatch Team
  Perfect. No, that's exactly what I needed to hear. Okay, cool. I will do a call with her. Because it's better to address this whole 85-15 thing right now instead of just sweeping it under the rug.

1:04:19 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, like that's not other lenders. you can say like, you know, are some of our clients are in these other business buying masterminds or other advisors or whatever.  And other lenders weren't asking for what you guys asked for. And that is not a good deal for them.  So you can give that feedback to your team too that, you know, having to force someone to give up ownership of the business, other lenders aren't asking them.  Now remains to be seen whether Joe is going to close his deal. But she passed on Lindsay and Kevin's deal because of client concentration.  Other lenders were able to come up with solutions for it. So they want to be competitive. We should it's it's we're doing a nice thing by giving them that feedback.  So you can position it in that way. hey, just, you know, want to give you some feedback. know Joe really wanted to work with you and you were his preferred, but I don't know if he's going to be able to now because other lenders aren't asking him to give up 15% of his business.

1:05:15 - AcquiMatch Team
  Perfect.

1:05:20 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Cool. I need to go in like two minutes. I know I've held you guys late. Anything else? And we were catch up tomorrow.  I wanted to chat about AH a little more deeply to you.

1:05:34 - AcquiMatch Team
  That's why I skipped them because I figured maybe you will talk about it.

1:05:38 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, I'm super excited about that one.

1:05:40 - AcquiMatch Team
  you so excited? I mean, yeah.

1:05:46 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Cool. Oh, really quick. Dave Collins in list. Onka's going to follow up with you process wise. think having David have a first pass and then you review that.  There's some Florida deals in there. There's some Texas deals. So it's not going to cover all of our clients, but maybe maybe there's some interesting deal or, you know, other folks in there.  So we'll be interesting. There's hundreds of deals, like, I think almost a thousand in there. So there's a lot.  Anka's going to follow up with you on how to handle that internally. We talked about some processes so that you guys can get David looking at that too.  Any other updates? I think that was the update. I wanted to give you guys on that. Oh, okay. Anything happening in off market with the new?

1:06:38 - AcquiMatch Team
  Not the moment. It's something I also want to talk with you tomorrow.

1:06:43 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay, cool. We'll pick that up tomorrow.

1:06:46 - AcquiMatch Team
  But I do want to end with a win. Luke got out his second write-up to Jason today. So we have hit minimum with 10 days left in the month.

1:06:57 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
   yeah, get him a third one. Like, what's over the- over this month, like, here's another one, ! And you're under offer on and off market manufacturing business, like, come on, nice work.  That's good. I think it's like, and Ryan, when you speak to him, just be like, this is how deal flow works.  It's not on a clock, you know, sometimes there's fits, sometimes there's spurts, sometimes there's dry spells. but just reiterate, like, we are always looking for you, you're always on our mind, we know.  And it's not you kicking us in the pants that gets you the deals.

1:07:33 - AcquiMatch Team
  It's just like, they come when they come. Yeah. Yeah, I used that actually yesterday on JJ, she was asking about, you know, if you saw her message, she's like, can we talk about deals or what a deal flow or something?  So, I had a call with her and she's asking about that. And I was explaining how it works. And I used the, we talk about you every day and she had a big smile when I said that.  So, that's That was a good idea.

1:08:02 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Remind me to talk to you about the lender or the private capital guy, too, because one of his opportunity zones is Ohio.  So if JJ likes this business or any other, he is a potential option for her.

1:08:16 - AcquiMatch Team
  OK.

1:08:18 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Cool.

1:08:19 - AcquiMatch Team
  right, that's awesome.

1:08:20 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Nice work, y'all. Thanks for staying late. Good SBA thing. And then just think, if there's anything you guys might need for me the week that I'm off to tomorrow is the kind of last day, and I'm flying my afternoon.  So if there's anything that you're going to need for me to speak now or forever hold your piece for a week and tell him back.  But I am fully confident you guys will be amazing. And I'm really excited to say that this is the thing we ask like, can the owner take a week off vacation?  And the business will be running when they get back. So this is one of those exciting tests as a founder.

1:09:00 - AcquiMatch Team
  And I am fully confident everything will be fantastic while I'm away. Absolutely.

1:09:06 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Sweet. Cool. All right. Well, have a good evening. We'll talk to you guys tomorrow. All right. Bye guys. Thanks.  Bye. Thank you. Bye.
