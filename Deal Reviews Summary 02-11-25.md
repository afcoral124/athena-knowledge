  I don't know.

0:03 - Luke Gillespie
  Hey.

0:05 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  That's a good one.

0:07 - Luke Gillespie
  Good. How are you?

0:08 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Good. That was fun. I think it was much better calling on them.

0:14 - AcquiMatch Team
  What do you guys think? Yeah.

0:19 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  What's that?

0:19 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah, good.

0:21 - AcquiMatch Team
  was better.

0:21 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah. And then you're really like controlling the conversation and putting them on the spot. Yeah. Yeah. Versus when it's voluntary.  no, people don't really talk much.

0:32 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah. It was good. filled the time. Also good. You know, to like call out like a couple of people under L.O.I.S.  right now. Like, you know, so like it's possible people are submitting L.O.I.S. So it's good to like cause it like kind of, I'm going to submit an L.O.I.

0:47 - Luke Gillespie
  You know?

0:48 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  You're missing out. Like everybody else is submitting L.O.I.S.

0:51 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah.

0:52 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah. Yeah. Go. him. hope I didn't like her much.

0:59 - Luke Gillespie
  I know. I was going to say if he doesn't show up on Thursday, we know why was I too I was trying nice.

1:06 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Was I too hard on him?

1:08 - Luke Gillespie
  No, you were you were fine. I just think that's just Gil's personality. I don't know. did you see, Greg?

1:14 - AcquiMatch Team
  Well, so I had the same feeling with him. Like I was like, I'm not sure I told him on the call.  I'm not trying to like force you to do anything or seem combative with you. But I don't agree with what you're saying.  I was like, I don't agree. And I literally, you know, it kind of words that flew out of Athena's mouth was like, almost exactly how I was coming out of my mouth.  And I'm just like, it's just the truth. It really is. It's just the truth. Yeah. I told Luke, after that call, I had with him, I didn't talk to you.  Yeah, Athena, but I talked to Luke after. And I was like, almost any one of our clients would buy that business, except for and then Gil decided.  think if that was an Oklahoma, Andrew would

3:00 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So I see a lot of MSPs, I think is what they're called, like we were coming across a ton of those when we're looking for Eli and even he ended up eliminating them because he didn't like it as an industry, but maybe get him to like brain dump a list of all the different things words that would fall under IT services so that you guys can like have the, you know, just be like, Hey, you know, our deal team goes out in front.  So can you rattle off all the words that you would relate to IT consulting so that we can make sure they they're super comprehensive in the way they pick that up.

3:38 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah, a good point.

3:39 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So we have all those extra words because I was going to tell uncle tends to deal team just to scrape for the letters IT and we'll just look at I would, I would, Ryan, like work with Gail and just be like, can you.  of us all of the words that you can think of or like areas because IT consulting is a bit general, so are there specific areas under IT consulting?  So it's like, you know, what Eve does is, like cyber security, you know, so like, and maybe that's the way you can put it back to them so it's not, it doesn't look like we don't know what we're doing.  It's like, hey, IT consulting is pretty generic. So would you be able to give me a list of all of the words that would fall under that that you feel comfortable with the, you know, areas of expertise, you know, the different types because we know there's lots of different things that can fall under IT consulting.  So, you know, could you be a little bit more specific on all the areas that you feel really comfortable in or confident in or would be interested in so we can make sure that the team is, you know, looking at the right kind of deals because that's a pretty generic area.  category. Maybe that'll help you get him to make breaks from all the germs, you know.

5:07 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah, but I see a good amount of businesses titled I T consulting. So I, Ryan and I talked about it and I'm pretty confident we could get too right after a month to.

5:17 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay. So what we do? kind of business was that that you just passed on?

5:22 - Luke Gillespie
  My glass business, Ryan?

5:23 - AcquiMatch Team
  Oh, God.

5:24 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  . I ask every time. Damn it.

5:32 - AcquiMatch Team
  Such a cool business. Like I was like the whole time I was listening to it.

5:36 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  was like, this is such a great business. So now we have a surplus good business, right?

5:43 - AcquiMatch Team
  Yeah. mean, I was thinking, I'm going to look at it. So I have a call scheduled with the seller in the morning.  I told him, hey, go past on the business. I think you have an amazing business. And I think we can find you a buyer.  And he said, okay, I said, let's talk tomorrow and we'll talk about. Well, he thought the process gave me any good feedback that we can improve it, and then I'll go find something else, someone else for you.  He said, okay, sounds good. We're going to talk tomorrow. And I'm going to go back and look at things.  And I have a call with Chris tomorrow. Tomorrow's my call with Chris. So I'm going to kind of give him the highlights and see if it's something that he'd be interested in.  It's low for his SDE. But I'm going to highlight a lot of things. I think there's a lot of opportunities for growth.  And it's it's a money printer. So I might like that.

6:34 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Cool. So if Chris doesn't want it, I think I have some other potential clients in the pipeline too. It's based in New York.  Long Island.

6:50 - AcquiMatch Team
  Long Island City. So that's just right outside. It's just right outside Manhattan. It's not that far. It's right across the bridge.

6:59 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay, cool. And then I know you all probably have your list of what you wanted, but this is top of mind for me.  So Andrew in the meeting with him, how did that go?

7:09 - AcquiMatch Team
  So, yes, that went good. So, he pretty much said, look, we had talked previously about DFW, finding something that was maybe remote or passive or something.  So, Luke presented him a couple of opportunities, and he was like, hey, look, I looked at those opportunities and it's still going to require me to spend a good amount of time there, or just amount that I don't feel comfortable enough not being there.  And he said, I really, if it's going to be there, it really needs to be like completely remote, like, he said he needs to have a bow on it, it needs to be like the best thing you've ever seen, and I want to say that if it's not that, I want  all my contacts are in Oklahoma, I know Oklahoma, my family's here, I want to be here. So I really, he's like, it means just getting me less amount of write-ups.  I'm fine with that. But he's like, I feel like there's, you guys are, he said, I feel like you guys are trying to get me a number or hit a minimum.  He's like, I don't, I want, you know, I do not care about that. All I care about is that you guys are out there trying to find businesses that work for me.  And he said, now if we're talking about you guys sending the out-of-state listings that are, it could be passive, I would nine times out of 10 prefer just sending me some type of online business.  And he's like, and I really want to do that because that's what he said. That's one of the reasons I wanted to work with you Ryan, is I saw that you had online business experience.  So I said, all right, we can get you more online. But this is the thing is that a lot of these are not SBA quality.
  ACTION ITEM: Prep for 1st biweekly call w/ Andrew (Mon 4pm) - review search criteria, online biz focus - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/230154286?timestamp=589.9999  He said, that's fine with me. I'll work out the financing. I'll get money from get, and I just want to make sure we're on the right page.  So I said, OK, look, he's like, what do you think we can do? I was like, let's set up a biweekly call, me and you, every single Monday at four o'clock, we jump on a call to talk through what we're doing, so you can feel more involved.  And he's like, let's do that. And I was like, and then we'll get you right ups. And then in between those, we'll always have a time where we can discuss them and recalibrate and go after fine-tune your search, so we can make sure you're happy with what you're getting.
  ACTION ITEM: Brainstorm w/ Luke re Andrew's deal search before Thurs mtg w/ Athena - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/230154286?timestamp=623.9999  And so he's like, all right, let's do that. So that's the plan.

10:31 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Love it. Also, you and me and Anka need to find a time because she's gone on Friday. So to talk about the brainstorm for him, specifically, I still want to get wild and I want to get creative for him, even if he's OK with online businesses.  So if you all haven't done the whole brainstorm amongst the team, why don't you do that? And then I'll get us some time on Thursday.  Legit, I will get on a plane and go out there. if we have some ideas on how we can make that work, because if we can crack him, we're going to have a lot more opportunity everywhere else.  So I think it's good. He's going to that, but let's not take our eye off the ball with solving the geo thing.  Cool. Okay, great. So then I was waiting to reach out to him about doing a buyer's club on real estate until I knew how he felt about us.  So I'll reach out to him about real estate stuff too. So cool. Who else is top of mind or what else did you want to chat about today?

11:40 - AcquiMatch Team
  Okay. So a she had a meeting scheduled with me for yesterday. Yesterday, she canceled and said that she had to be in hospital.
  ACTION ITEM: Follow up w/ VH re broker intros made - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/230154286?timestamp=726.9999  So she is in the ER. So that's unfortunate. So yeah, unfortunately that's where she's at. We're just gonna have to follow up with her in a couple of days to see what the latest is on her.

12:12 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay.

12:17 - AcquiMatch Team
  VH, we made two broker intros. I've messaged him this week. He has not responded. I will follow up tomorrow.  What do you think about that?

12:48 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Oh, I said, okay. Sorry.

12:50 - AcquiMatch Team
  I was waiting on you to do your next one. I'm trying to pause after these.

12:55 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  No, thank you. Yeah. I mean, Brian. Brian's. I appreciate your patience with him because I certainly am losing my mind, so it's good for you to be at the front lines at this point.

13:10 - AcquiMatch Team
  Okay. I'll follow up with him tomorrow. Chris submitted an IOI over week ago that they narrowed him and two others down to the final contestants.  They went with an offer that went above market price and someone who had direct experience, but they said that they thought he was a close runner up.
  ACTION ITEM: Follow up w/ Chris re recent broker call, discuss offer strategy (competitive IOIs/LOIs) - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/230154286?timestamp=812.9999  So fortunately, he was not selected for that. He did have a broker call yesterday scheduled. I haven't followed up with him about how the broker call went, but we will talk about that tomorrow.

13:53 - Luke Gillespie
  It looks like it went well, Ryan. He said in the email that he's going to review the material and then go for a seller call.  Well, that's what he told the broker.

15:02 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So, have him revisit what he did and ideally see like, hey, dude, on these larger businesses that are competitive, you can't be under an offer.  This isn't real estate, like, and also when there's competitive IOI situations, you're probably not going to be given another opportunity negotiate.  Go in high. You're going at least at asking.

15:23 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah.

15:25 - AcquiMatch Team
  Okay.

15:25 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Did you run the offer past you before you sent it, Ryan, or did you just send it?

15:28 - AcquiMatch Team
  Yeah. It did. It showed it to me. I didn't push back on the undertown, on the 10% under, I said, I think it looks fine.  The margins were pretty low on the business. doesn't have tons of experience in the trucking industry. So trying to make something that worked a little bit more for him, a little bit more comfort room, I thought was a decent strategy.  I understand what you're saying.

15:57 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah. Well, I mean, if nothing else, just like. Like hey, let's do Not a recap, what is it called?  Can you wait?

16:08 - Luke Gillespie
  Reflection on the failure. Yeah, there's another word that you use like after you play a game, you know Like it's a sports thing Deep breathe no, maybe a debrief.

16:23 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay, you're not a sports thing at all Doing some debrief like after they lose and like if they've done something meaningful like some in an LOI or an IOI Make sure you do a debrief and go through that process work out what happened and give them your thoughts or get them to Self-select why they didn't get that, you know, it's like, okay Well, put in an offer under asking that service coverage still worked.  Why did you do that? You know, um So like and what are you taking from this? are you gonna apply going forward?  How can you because he keeps losing deals because he's not being competitive like How many is he lost now?  I would even add it up, like, hey, yeah, you've lost three, four deals now, because you're not being competitive enough.  So what can you do here? Like, we don't want you, we don't want you to keep losing deals. We don't, we don't want you to be a client anymore.  But if you're not going to be competitive, we're going to struggle here.

17:18 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah, because his deals are very competitive.

17:21 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, like on the bigger, on the big boys deals that you want, you got to go higher up, you know, like, and so when you know that there's other players in the mix and you go under asking, it's almost like you don't want to close on a deal.

17:34 - Luke Gillespie
  So what's going on there? Yeah.

17:37 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  And I can't doing IOIs instead of LOI, it just feels like, honestly, if I'm looking at the pattern. So everybody has their own pattern, right?  And with Chris now, multiple times, he's not been competitive or not enough. hungry enough to get a deal done, which had to be a protective mechanism when people just keep putting themselves in a losing situation, right?  So even though he comes across super confident, like he knows what he's doing, whatever, like he's got the fear at some point, just like everybody else.  And sometimes people do things to stop themselves from moving forward without realizing that they're doing it. So now it's like a point to call out the pattern like, Hey, Jude, you lost what for now?  Maybe more because you weren't competitive enough. Are you not loving the deals? Are you concerned? what's going on? how are you feeling about these when you're submitting them, or what's making you decide to win under asking?  Because especially on the side of deals that you want, there's so much competition, like, you're just going to keep losing these opportunities and, you know, we'll bring you off market things every now and then when they  make your deal box, but even the off market opportunities, you know, few and far between. So Yeah, I'm seeing enough of a pattern.  I'm wondering if this is a self sabotage thing that he's not realizing he's doing.

19:16 - AcquiMatch Team
  Okay, I think it's a good time for me to bring up that question so I can do that.

19:21 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, you know, but it's like, hey, what, you know, you went in under asking when you knew there was competition on this and it felt like a good business, like talk me through that.

19:32 - Luke Gillespie
  And maybe keep that in mind if he's planning on making an offer for this landscaping business in Colorado, he's looking at it because even at asking price, it's priced super cheaply.  And he still has a 2.5 DSCR and almost 600 KSD.

19:46 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Amazing.

19:47 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah. yeah, I'm that the one where he got his eye rejected because he sent it under. kind of had a feeling like that too, when I saw it in Slack channel that he wandered out under offer, but I just didn't say  because I guess I I wasn't as confident and I don't really interact with the clients like that, but now I know I should emphasize that more in the right of because I like I had a feeling with this business because the broker says he's gonna need to put it in an offer by within a week or two, you know, competitive, blah, blah, and that that's why in the right up I didn't even model out a 10% discount, I modeled out a higher price.

20:20 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So don't I mean obviously clients on the front Ryan's on the front line with the clients, we all want to look like we're united, but if you see something like that, flag it with Ryan immediately, right?  Because you're the one having the conversations with the broker now, Ryan's more interacting with the client, so he doesn't necessarily have like, he's quickly reviewing the write-ups and that sort of thing, but you have a much better understanding of that.  So like work as a team and flag it with Ryan, if you see that with Chris, be like, that might be a problem the broker told me this, right?  Because and Ryan, I'm speaking on your behalf, but I remember when I was not in this, when I was role-reflect, right, and Ryan was doing all the write-ups.  and everything and then handing over me and I was very quickly trying to get up to speed with the deal to help the client.  I didn't necessarily understand certain aspects of it or I didn't catch the fact like, oh , this is super competitive or worse at this.  work as a team and like filament, like if you see those sorts of things, you don't necessarily need to say it's a client, but you should say it's Ryan and Ryan will be like, no, it's cool already talking about it or hey, good flag.  Thanks for letting me know.

21:25 - Luke Gillespie
  I'll bring it up with Chris, you know. Yeah, that was my mistake. I felt like telling Ryan, but then I just didn't get around to it.  So lessons are good.

21:33 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Quick quick message, quick little slack DM voice note, whatever, you know, like that that can save a deal. So these things get really time sensitive too.  And also, you're going to, you know, you're closer to it, spent more time on it, you're going to see things sometimes that that we might miss, you know, and I'm even further removed from it.  So I'm taking the risk of calling him out and be like, tell me about your feeling, gills, like, owners too involved, I don't like it.  I'm like, okay, well. I don't know whether the owner is or not, but I know what you're like. I know, you know, most the these owners are like, they don't want to go home.  They want to work. They're happier at work, you know. I don't know whether, like, I could have just been talking about my  and legitimately the owners like working way too much, and it's not genuinely, I don't know, you know, but so we can all help each other out.  And then I say things in general. So then like, and I try not to do anything that would be different from what Ryan's already telling them.  And I knew Ryan was having that conversation with him and, you know, so just reaffirming that. So, yeah, we all have to work in tandem and especially now, David's going to be like earlier in the funnel, right?  So we like, yeah, this little, and he does dealing with the brokers and chasing . And so we all have this little telephone system.  And it's like, if you see something or your gut tells you something, act on it. And then you can learn whether your instinct was was on or not, right?  So it's an awesome. opportunity for you. like, oh, because eventually we'd love to have you on the front lines and doing some of this stuff too, right?  It's like learning and seeing whether your instinct is in a good place. Like, I don't think Ryan's ever gonna be like, no, thank you.  I didn't want that information.

23:17 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah. Good point. Cool.

23:21 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Nice one. Um, okay, what else is going on there Ryan?

23:27 - AcquiMatch Team
  Um, D. L. We still just have this like nightclub business right now. But I wanted to ask, did you look at those?  Did you get a chance to speak with the broker today, Luke, about those deal opportunities?

23:42 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah, I had private message you about the plumbing business. I just don't think you got to it because you were so busy.  But so there were two businesses. was a window company. It's just cash flowing horribly. It just was not going to work.
  SCREEN SHARING: Luke started screen sharing - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/230154286?timestamp=1464.112252  The second was this plumbing business. And it's decent. It's not a dreamland plumbing. So first, before we even start talking about the business, my question that I wanted to ask is they included as an ad back, the advertising expense.  So you'll see in the 2024 net income, they spent 553K right there, highlighted on advertising. And so this company was just started in 2022.  However, it has already been SBA pre qualified. So SBA okayed it. But so you see that 553K advertising expense.  And then for the 2024 SDE, yeah, for the SD in order to make this cashflow work for Destin and Lindsey, the SDE for 2024 is 648K.  But they included a $200,000 ad back out of that 500K. And the broker's explanation for is that because it was a new company, they were spending a lot of money on advertising.  And so now that it's established, they don't need to spend that much on marketing. they're adding back the 200 out of the 500.  DK in advertising and if you scroll back to 2023 So that 500k was about 20% of revenue on advertising spend and 2023 Advertiser spend was about 10% of revenue.  So that's my question to you guys is is this a valid ad back adding back 200k and advertising?

26:21 - AcquiMatch Team
  Nice catch there You saw yourself or did how did you did he bring that up?

26:29 - Luke Gillespie
  Oh, no, I brought it up in the call and then I I mentioned it as well because I noticed it nice and Also, he mentioned which may make us more worrisome about this ad spend is that he did he said they were paying for leads Like this e-local and results calls pay per call.  So I guess it's like you kind of pay for qualified leads Again, don't know if that's all of the advertising expense And also another caveat on this is there is no formal sim yet.  This business technically has an even been listed yet, like it's on his website, but it's not on biz buy, sell or anything.  I'm the first person that's inquired about the business. I'm the first person he's taught, he spoke to about it.

27:09 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Um, so that's my work, Luke. We love catching a Marley.

27:13 - Luke Gillespie
  Thanks. Shout out to Ryan. He got this through his connection. I think it was from that updating email and the Aquaman branding or something like that.

27:19 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah.

27:21 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah, anyway, that's like, you know, so funny. Yeah, yeah.

27:26 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Uh, I'll, I'll let Ryan respond.

27:30 - Luke Gillespie
  I have, I have lots, but anyway, so this, so, so at asking price, if you include the 200k ad back, you see it ends up 2.5 DSCR 388k SD for If you subtract that 200k, now it's still 1.7 DSCR, but only 188 SD and reminder DL are looking for ideally 400k SD minimum 200k.

27:56 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  If you adjust the asking price, based on the original multiple.

28:01 - Luke Gillespie
  What does it look like? Ah, good idea. Oh, yeah. That was the same.

28:14 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Oh, because you still got the 648 though.

28:17 - Luke Gillespie
  Oh, geez. 2.3. Whoops. 2.4, 7. Okay, 264k now.

28:49 - AcquiMatch Team
  So, what do you think, Ryan? So, I'm pretty firm about not adding back advertising costs. you know, I usually ask for explanation.  So we'll have people, hey, I want to add back this cost because such and I usually would just ask why.  And I've never heard a reasonable explanation for adding back an advertising cost. Yeah, it's a, it's mostly just a cross your fingers moment for the seller and try to convince you that.

29:29 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah, add back.

29:34 - AcquiMatch Team
  If the business is just starting and you're advertising because the business is just starting. Well, without that advertising, you may just never get a customer.  So you have to show that. And by eliminating the advertising costs, you're saying that that customer is coming organically.  But there's there's literally no way to show if they're a grant or not, even if I send you an ad and you look at the ad and you don't do business with me for a whole other year, I'm still a customer that was acquired through advertising, even though if the advertising dollar doesn't spend, doesn't count from my sale a year or two years later.  So every dollar you spend on advertising, there's no way to tie it directly to the sale.

30:31 - Luke Gillespie
  So it's, I mean, it's a little bit disingenuous to say that you can add it back. Yeah, and I guess to play devil's advocate, what they would say is, okay, we just started in 2022 and we went from, actually the ad back sort of right here, we went from in 2023, 300k, net profit, 300k sde to 648k sde.  SD and through that in that time, we've accumulated. Okay, we have 10 employees, managers and stuff. have 14,000 customers and we have, they started a membership thing recently, but apparently, but they only have 50 so far and it renews every year, 10 to $70 a month.  So I guess that's what they would say. But I mean, I'm kind of inclined to think to thinking Ryan and think, yeah, it's kind of a BS ad back, unless we want to ask to be in the middle and only add back 100k, something like that.

31:35 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  We don't, we don't negotiate this Luke. So we call it out for clients as the, on an opportunity, right?  So like, they, they don't know that we know that. So they did not have 648 in SDE. They had 448 in SDE.  So they increased from 350 to 448, which is a reasonable job. When you put a deal in front of a client, you aren't going to go and negotiate with the broker on the ad-backs on their back, right?  You flag it with a client and we walk them through. If they like business, then they're going to be making an offer based on like the STE that we're calculating.

32:22 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah.

32:23 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Was this SBA pretty cool?

32:25 - Luke Gillespie
  Yes.

32:26 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  And it was on the 648, they thought that was a valid ad-back of $200k.

32:32 - Luke Gillespie
  He said, yeah, it's been SBA pre-qualified for $1.5 million.

32:37 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  $1.5 below asking.

32:40 - Luke Gillespie
  Exactly, yeah. And that was just, he said off the top of his head, he said he could send me the term sheets if I wanted to see him.  brand new listing, so he didn't know the most about the business, but yeah, this is what I've gleaned from it.

32:54 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, so what was their, what was their floor for SDA?

32:59 - Luke Gillespie
  was the minimum that they were looking for? 200. Yeah. 200.

33:02 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So it works.

33:03 - Luke Gillespie
  Right.

33:04 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  If, if we don't count that as an ad back and they use the original multiple.

33:11 - Luke Gillespie
  Okay. And then that, yeah. Okay. And then, yeah, just. this is one of those ones where we have to give them new ones.

33:18 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  That's right. It's like, Hey, we, you know, there's a lot of solid things about this business. There's some questionable ad back.  So there'll be some negotiation before you get to an offer, but you're not at that stage right now. You're looking at one of your first deals.  You want to see whether you like plumbing, whether you like this business, whether you like the owner. If you do, then when we get further down the line, this is something like that's, that's a area of concern and like points points for them to be aware of.  And then, since it'll be their first write up, Ryan, you will be on the phone with them, talking it through with them and just being like, and explaining all the things that you just  just why I never add back advertising. But sometimes the brokers will try to put these things in, right? And to try to get them a better price, but we're not at the negotiation stage right now.  We're at the dating stage. And then if you like it down the line, then you will have some negotiating to do.  So just be aware that there are some questionable adbacks here.

34:27 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah.

34:28 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  But that's normal. Sometimes the brokers take a swing. So yeah, I mean, it sounds good.

34:38 - Luke Gillespie
  Otherwise, right? Yeah. I mean, you see here salesmen is already in place. The service manager doesn't love the sales.  So I'm making point to remember that for every deal deal. And it is semi absentee right now. They say he's only working about eight to 15 hours per week.  And it's still doing this well, you know, so that's a good sign. Um, licensing, licensing sounds good because I know I've included as a concern here, but the current owner doesn't have the master's plumbing license.  There's an outside qualifier qualifying the business and they say he'll continue to do it for one to one five K a month.  Several team members already on the team can be incentivized to take the test and get their own license. They already have all the hours needed.  Um, yep, so it's huge opportunity for growth that they just invested that extra difference between 40 hours and eight to 15 hours a week on growing the business.  I like this.

35:28 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, I mean, like if they expanded that, um, yeah, it's a try to never really see these blue column service businesses do these memberships.  Yeah, I think I think it sounds like a good opportunity. We just need to make sure that we flag those sorts of things to them, yep, like area of clarification.  I would restate the fact that like what exactly is the advertising ad back for? Can they like mine item?  All of the expenses that they're adding back and why like if It's we're no longer using this lead system.  It's like, okay, well, when did you stop using it and have you been able to keep revenue consistency and stopping use it?  Is there any proof that you're able to keep the consistency of revenue and leads, etc, without using whatever it was that you were using?  So that's not a first or even a second conversation thing, but that's what Ryan will talk them through, right?  It's like, this is something that is this is there's words on every deal. This is the word. We don't go into the first day asking about this stuff though.  So you just you have your have awareness about it. Um, I think it's good. So this sounds like a good for the first and then you can do the nightclub after that.

36:48 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah. Um, yeah. Have the nightclub here as well as we'd like to see that.

36:54 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  What was our what was our concern about the nightclub before?

36:57 - AcquiMatch Team
  can't Oh, the nightclub though.

37:00 - Luke Gillespie
  the only concern is just I guess it being a night club but they did mark that avail it's just like I told I was like I wouldn't mind if this was their second one but it's just weird for me the first one yeah so now we can do plumbing for their first and then we can deliver the night club for the second yeah so this nightclub is interesting it's being priced at like a one X multiple the way the broker described it is this guy he doesn't he forgot I did the call today but I forgot what she said but it was like this guy doesn't want to be in trouble for the new owner just to take it over at that value and she said I told him you should sell for a 2.5 and he was like no just this number is good for me and the only concern with this one is that the landlord is a bit of a stickler and he's they have closed out buyers before because they didn't have experience in the nightclub industry and so this broker saying the landlord is the thing that's going to be a problem but she says she'll work with this the buyer to come up with a business plan and help ease the way

38:12 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay. Okay.

38:13 - Luke Gillespie
  Okay. Yeah, I know this. Yeah.

38:16 - AcquiMatch Team
  Well, I forgot to ask, what was the reason for the plumbers selling?

38:22 - Luke Gillespie
  Moving out of state.

38:24 - AcquiMatch Team
  Moving out of state.

38:25 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah. The broker said said his wife and then didn't give more details on it. So, yeah, he's moving to Georgia and he's wanting to sell soon because he wants to move out of state.

40:07 - AcquiMatch Team
  Yeah, put my phone up again tomorrow.

40:09 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay, cool. Um, anyone else who wanted to update on Ryan, I've had some stuff you want to roll through to.

40:18 - AcquiMatch Team
  Oh, that's good for me.

40:20 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Cool. Luke, how about you?

40:22 - Luke Gillespie
  Yes, I did have one deal specific question I wanted to bring up. Um, let me share my screen again.
  SCREEN SHARING: Luke started screen sharing - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/230154286?timestamp=2433.661063  Okay, so this is a grading and excavation company that's that's probably actually requested personally herself. So I did the broker call sounds like a good business.  My question is, so you see right here, they're asking for 5.3 million. That's including the real estate valued at 1.8 million.  So it wouldn't qualify for the 504 25 year and more 6% interest rate, right, because the real estate is not 51% of the purchase price, but the broker mentioned to me.

41:00 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  on the call that oh it will it won't be the 25 year mr but it'll qualify for more like a 20 year amortization or something like that that's what the broker said yeah there's seven a yeah which is where the business needs to be more than 51% to be able to add all of the business loan payments in to extend it over 25 years okay 504 is a separate real estate loan and so we have to value the business separately from the real estate regardless of what loan they are using so you pull you have to pull the price out of the business and do that over 10 years and then the real estate over say 20 at a different interest rate okay so yeah the 10

42:00 - Luke Gillespie
  10% 10 years for that $3.5 million for the business and then 25 years, 6% for the real estate.

42:08 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, or like do 20 to be safe.

42:11 - Luke Gillespie
  Okay.

42:11 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  then that real estate payment will be an expense of the business. So we just need to make sure that it's listed as an expense.  But to be clear, 7A is a business loan. That's an SBA business loan. Sometimes when the debt service is tight, like if we're pushing a 4X multiple or whatever, and there's real estate that can be more than 51% of the cost, then what we do is we add the real estate to the 7A loan.  So then amortizes all of the loan payments over 25 years.

42:54 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah.

42:55 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  504, on the other hand, would be a separate loan. phone in addition to the seven a so let's say the real estate is what it is here where it's 34% or whatever so our buyers will get a seven a loan for the business and then a 504 loan for the real estate.

43:14 - Luke Gillespie
  Okay.

43:16 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Do you understand?

43:18 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah.

43:19 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay.

43:21 - Luke Gillespie
  Because because I was doing some research and it said that they can do a blended term like a weighted average for the real estate in the business.

43:34 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Is that doable? That's seven a that's what I explained to you. If the real estate is more than 51% of the project cost then they will add it to seven a and that will extend the business and the real estate payments.  So you're adding it in one.

43:54 - Luke Gillespie
  It's one loan. Yeah.

43:56 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  You can only do that when the real estate is more than 51%. of the project cost if it is not then it has to be two separate ones.

44:08 - Luke Gillespie
  Okay.

44:09 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Seven eight and five oh four. Seven eight is a business one. Five oh four is a real estate one.

44:15 - Luke Gillespie
  Yep.

44:16 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Now the exception to this to further confuse things. Let's say, because we're on the edge here, they add a note in that pulls the real estate to be more than 51% of the project costs.  Yeah, SBA, right. So if they were able to get the seller to take a 20% note, for example, then the real estate would be more than 51% of the loan amount.

44:45 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah, I get what you're saying. So yeah, so my, so I'm trying to figure it out back to me because I don't feel like you grasped all that.

44:57 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So I want you to replay everything that I just told you. about this, to make sense.

45:01 - Luke Gillespie
  so $1.8 million. So if they don't do any seller note, right, it would be separated into two loans, the 7A for the business of that $3.5 million.  And then it would be the real estate loan, would be the 504 loan, right? And then if they do get a seller note, that could make the real estate be 51% or more of the total loan amount.  And what that would do is, let's say they got one, not $1 million, but they would need, however much out of that $3.5 million business price to be a seller note, so that then the value of this real estate that was being loaned was more than the value of the business that was being loaned, because the seller note isn't being loaned by the SBA.  So by the SBA's view, it's still 51% more in the real estate. So they would get the 25-year M1 and 6.5% interest rate.

45:53 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  No, like almost there, they would get a 25-year amortization on the entire loan. at 10 percent.

46:02 - Luke Gillespie
  Okay. I did it.

46:06 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah. So this is good for when the debt services crunched. Most of the time we're actually going to want them to do two separate logs.

46:15 - Luke Gillespie
  Okay.

46:16 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Right. So but if it's like a competitive deal and there's a bunch of offers and we need to put it in at like a four or 4.5, then we could you know say okay we can offer actually a lot more but you're not in the structuring phase right now.  I want you to do is just make sure that you value the real estate and the business separately and treat them as two separate loans so that they can and like make sure that if we're giving them the amount left after loan payments that you're including a mortgage payment.  If it's different than like you need to know what they're paying for rent right now. Are they paying rent to themselves and how much different is that because it's going to be an expense.

47:00 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah, exactly.

47:01 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Does that make sense? what you need to do, first of all, is like, go look at the financial, see if you can figure out how much they pay for rent.  Do a rough calculation of what a mortgage would cost 20 years at like, you know, 6% just on the business.  Okay, there we go rent 60,000. So then you need to make an adjustment based on what the mortgage payments would be.  If it's going to be more than 60,000, and then you need to calculate the loan for the business separately.  So that's good if it's actually valued with the real estate included 5.3 on almost a million in SDE, supposedly.

47:51 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah, but yeah, when I include that in our calculator at 10 or 10% this is what it looks like for Paul, Stephen Paul.

48:00 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  No, but you need to pull the real estate out and do it over a 25-year amortization because that's what almost always people are going to do is they're going to do a separate real estate loan over 20 years at 6%, 6.5%.  That is going to be an expense to the business. You need to compare with that mortgage expenses to the rent that is being paid.  And if it's different, then your 10% calculation on the business expenses, not put the real estate in there and then make an adjustment for the expense of the real estate, if it is different.  So say you do the mortgage calculations and it comes up to 100,000 per year, then what do you need to do to that rent expense?

48:52 - Luke Gillespie
  What do you need to do to the overall expenses or to the SDE? Yeah, the total rent would be 100, and then you would subtract.  that is to you by 40K.

49:02 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Exactly. And then just do the value of the business. So the total project cost would not be the 5.  Whatever million it would be. The 3.5 plus the deal expenses. Yeah. Ryan, I'm sure you tracked all that. I do it all again to make sure like the calculations are coming through.

49:28 - Luke Gillespie
  Have Ryan check it.

49:31 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Because we never ever value a business with the real estate in it. We're always going to value it separately.  But there is things that we create things we can do is structuring down the line. If we need to.

49:45 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah, I get that.

49:47 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Cool. This one was, it's a head . It's a lot to rock your head around. But more that you do these kinds of deals.  ways that we can structure it. But what is most important is to figure out the cash flow. Like if you buy the real estate and the business, what does a cash flow look like?  And the real estate probably almost always is going to be in a separate loan, because then they're not paying the higher interest rate, unless they want the 25 year am and then we can, you know, saving and structure, seller note, et cetera, et cetera.  But for the purposes of the write up, I think to keep it simple, just always default to separate 7A loan that looks at the rent to mortgage difference and gives them a cash flow idea there.  And then you tell them, I've, you know, a 20 year am just on the real estate, 6.5%, those loan payments were 100,000 annually.  They're currently paying 60,000 in rent. So I've adjusted SD, just tell them what you did there.

50:51 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah, yeah, know that that makes a lot of sense. I was just trying to make sure that it's still cash flow for SP.  And now if I do an extremely rough estimate of like. 3.5 million business price, and I adjust the SD down by 60k, which is probably even overly conservative.  They still end up with 360k SD. it works for them. Okay. Yeah, great.

51:10 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Cool. So revamp the calculations run it past Ryan. So he can just double check that the way it's portrayed into the client makes sense.  Ryan, if you need to talk through structuring with real estate, I know we haven't gotten to that yet, you bring it to this and we can do it so we can all learn through it too.  But yeah, sounds like a good cashflow opportunity for them.

51:33 - Luke Gillespie
  Yep.

51:34 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Was that your question? was around the root. Sorry. kind of like did an option there.

51:39 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah, I'm on real estate. Yeah, I know. That was my question. Yeah, figuring out how to do that calculator for SP for this right up.

51:49 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah. Nice. Okay, cool. I know we're at time. Anything else you two?

51:54 - Luke Gillespie
  I got nothing.

51:55 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Good work. We've got clients working on deals. I think it's Sounds like we're still putting deals in front of Jason and JB, just important, keep the deals coming even if it like a lower level for the people under LOI.  So we're, you know, obviously we want to hit the minimums, but like Andrew's pointing out like, you know, quality deals that was really interesting with Lindsey and Kevin as we were like sending more opportunities and they ended up buying too.

52:25 - Luke Gillespie
  So we never know. Yep.

52:27 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Oh my gosh, I didn't show you guys. Hang on. I'm in swab hands still last. We got some new like thingies.

52:42 - Luke Gillespie
  Nice.

52:43 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  I think these look a lot better than the original ones.

52:45 - AcquiMatch Team
  They're cool. Hold Rick and Nicholas. That's it. Okay. Wow.

52:51 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  But the overall Kimstone, do you like them?

52:54 - AcquiMatch Team
  Yeah, and the brand name.

52:57 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  What? This one?

52:59 - AcquiMatch Team
  Yeah, like we match.

53:00 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, it's cute, right? I didn't like the first ones that we did because it looked like a piece of paper stuck to a piece of acrylic, which is what it was.  I want a lot more of these this year, so this is what's coming when y'all find some more businesses that are clients close on.

53:20 - AcquiMatch Team
  We got so close too.

53:22 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  What's that? Yeah, I know. I'm so excited. I was just adding up. We've gotten nine signed L.O.5 since we've started too.

53:32 - AcquiMatch Team
  Okay.

53:34 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  That's good. It's a good amount. It's lot more than most people have gotten, so many more, but we're close, we're close.

53:43 - AcquiMatch Team
  Yep.

53:43 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Awesome. Okay, cool. I'm going to jump off. I'm actually meeting with our spreadsheet guy. He's made a seriously complicated spreadsheet, which that's good.  I want all the thingies in there, and then we're going to make it user-friendly after that.

53:58 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah. So...

54:00 - AcquiMatch Team
  Sweet.

54:01 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Awesome. Cool. Nice work. Ryan, I'll make sure I want to get some time in on Thursday for us to talk through the Oklahoma stuff too, before she's away.  just if you all can have that conversation, if you haven't already on the brainstorm.

54:16 - AcquiMatch Team
  We had that conversation, we'll be ready on Thursday.

54:19 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Thank you. All right. See you guys. Bye.
