# Buyers Club 04/15/24

[00:00:00] 

**Athena:** Hello. Hello. Welcome. Welcome. Hey Gil. 

Hello. 

**Athena:** Oh, nice background. You're matching the team. We, we usually have the majestic palm in the background. 

**Gil:** I was told, I seemed as if I was in a dungeon before a basement before. So you've got one too. 

**Athena:** You guys. I need to get my plant out. I just moved house yesterday, so I'll bring my plant.

So we're all matching going forward. 

**Steve:** It's so hard to find a fake plant that looks good, that doesn't cost you a thousand bucks. It's amazing. Yeah. Yeah. 

**Athena:** My mom used to specialize in those. My mom was an interior designer, like particularly for, she was an interior space architect for like large scale offices and stuff.

So all of our homes always had fake plants, which is why I have no idea how to keep plants alive. I am exceptionally talented at killing succulents, which are supposed to be the easiest thing. Like, I don't know what I do, but I kill 'em every time. [00:01:00] So, um, but I am very proud of the majestic palm that I've barely been able to keep alive for like two years.

So. Anyways, it's nice to see you. Um, so, uh, would love to get some updates. Um, I know we've got some exciting meetings, exciting things happening, and it seems like everybody's all kind of running towards offers right now, which we love this kind of energy. So, um, Steve was just first gonna get an update from you, see if there's any news or updates on your deal, and then Gil, I know you have some exciting stuff coming up, so I'll, I'll pick on you later and we can kind of talk through that stuff after we get an update from Steve.

**Steve:** Yeah, I don't have much of an update to be honest with you. So on Friday the broker said that. Think I forwarded onto it. She said, uh, basically she wants to go through all the offers and she's expected to be sometime this week, uh, that she was gonna kind of really go through it and pray on what she's gonna do.

So, [00:02:00] uh, I've tried, it's Tuesday. I wanted to call yesterday morning at, you know, 8:00 AM But, uh, my, my mind says, you know, don't put too much pressure on this lady. So, uh, I'm, I was going to give it a until tomorrow. I haven't heard anything by midday tomorrow. I'm gonna just, you know, do a soft reach out.

**Athena:** Great. Awesome. And if you want, 'cause I, I believe most of the updates happen with just us, just give everybody an update. Also, the cool tactic do you use because it was a highly competitive deal. So just give us an overview really quick on how you got to this point. 

**Steve:** Yeah. Yeah. So, uh, so it's a towing company and, uh, the, the towing company is outta state for us, but we're willing to, to do that transition, et cetera.

Everything looked good. Work with, uh, Ryan and just kind of hammered it out. It was, it was one of those deals where you put it down on paper and it was just one of those businesses that you're like, okay, recession. Uh, you know, boom, it doesn't matter. Cars are breaking down. It's been in, it's been in business since [00:03:00] 1977.

Uh, owners, uh, the husband is since outta the business. The wife is, uh, still, she owns the business. She's in her early eighties, it seems, uh, her, she's got a daughter and a son-in-law in the business, uh, that actually run the operation for them. They, they want to retire in the next three-ish, three to five years.

So they'd like to stay on. So, as an operator, if, if, if we gel as people, uh, it, it seems to be a, a no-brainer if the numbers seem to work out. But, you know, we haven't done any due diligence yet. So anyway, went to the point of they were going to, we tried to get down to visit them as well and got pushed back at the end saying that all, all these calls and all the, um, that this woman was dealing with was just.

Too overwhelming for her. So we just pumped the brakes and backed off, said, Hey, do what you gotta do. Uh, but they did a call for offers. Uh, we actually [00:04:00] working with Brian and Athena, um, made the decision, let's skip the offer, go right to LO, I put an LOI in front of them. Uh, and then on some, I don't know, some really smart suggestion by somebody in this room here, uh, to, to, because we knew it was gonna be really competitive, uh, to do a video.

So, uh, my wife and I did a video. Paul and I did a video, short video. It was like two minutes introducing ourselves, what our interest is, what our interest is with the business. Uh, and it wasn't, uh, you know, nothing spectacular other than just get to know us. And the broker came back and said, um, first call, Polly said they loved the video.

The woman loved the video. Uh, number one I spoke to the broker, said. That was a nice touch. You guys really kind of set yourselves apart, uh, but now the, the owner's trying to choose, uh, two, uh, different two to three folks and then do some face-to-face and some real, um, uh, you know, get [00:05:00] down and dirty of it.

So we're, we're, we're, we're patiently waiting right now, and patience is not one of my, uh, strong suits. So. 

**Athena:** It's, it's exciting when you get to this point. So like, first of all, well done, like first LOI out, so that must feel really exciting to get to that point. Um, and I, I think it's something to really pull out because it was, it felt like there was a really strong value and connection around family between Steve and Polly and this seller and like having family in the business, which is where that suggestion of the video cover letter came in.

But just something for y'all to think about. If you're in one of those situations where the broker's gatekeeping the owner and you, you are denied the opportunity to create a relationship. It's like, well. Here's, here's, you know, where like, I don't necessarily follow convention in that. I'm like, how do I create a relationship when I'm not able to create a relationship?

So, like, you know, with every objection that [00:06:00] we get moving, like water through it and it's like, well send a quick video and either the broker's gonna show 'em or they're not. But you're taking, trying to take an element of control back to make that connection. And in this case it just, it, you know, these sellers.

Bless 'em. It, it must get completely overwhelming to speak to all of these people and they're like, in 2022 you had a dip in revenue in month five. Like, what was that about? They're just like, what the hell? I don't know. You know? So like to have someone like be just human with 'em and can connect with them, so.

Yeah, the 

**Steve:** 0.2 points. So number one, Polly had to call herself with, uh, the woman. I was busy, which is probably a good thing because I get very bottom line numbers and this and that. Polly, she didn't even get into the numbers. She sensed that she was real nervous. So it was just about connection. Tell me about the business.

It seems wonderful. So she is so much [00:07:00] better at that than I am. I get down and write down and let me, why, why did that happen? So, uh, it was, it was, it was a good match there, number one. And the other thing is, I'll just throw it out there, because we did the video on one take. It wasn't, we didn't spend days trying to put it together.

And if everybody's done videos before you, like you, you listen to you like, oh man, that sucked. I gotta do it again. Or you get halfway through and you just, and you're like, you, you missed a, a line you wanted to say, you stumble over your words and you're trying to get it perfect. So, but I, I'll say the, you know, the, the hack behind all of it is.

So I leveraged AI number one, I gave it five prompts. Here's the message I'm trying to get across. And it came back and I said, okay, I wanna make it conversational. And it came back and then we went through and said, yeah, I would never say that. And kind of, we just do, but it gave us the framework. So something that would've taken us eight hours to figure out how do we wanna approach this, gave us the framework.

It literally, we did it in under an hour from start [00:08:00] to finish and out the door. So 

**Athena:** that's awesome. It's really everybody 

**Steve:** on, on this thread here. So if, if there's something I found is, it's not rocket science, what I just said, but it, it actually did work for me. 

**Athena:** That's awesome. We, we love, like AI and like how it can help us do things quicker.

And like, I, I use it a lot for, uh, conversational help, you know, because it's like, you can tell it all the things that like, here's all the things that are happening right now. Here's the outcome that I want. Here's my read of the situation. So if you prompt it, good, then it ends up being you, right? It's just.

You know, if it's the end of the day and the end of the day for me, my brain stops working and I start cussing more, and that's not necessarily how I want it to go. So like, CHATT just takes that load off of me and it's like, here's the thing, the fresh brain, you know, words. But, um, to also just get over the like concerns you might have about [00:09:00] difficult conversations.

So I would use it, and I do use it to script out negotiations too, and have it like role play with me for, um, negotiation strategy. And I'm like, what would Chris boss from never split the difference, like do in this scenario, you know, how would he handle it? Um, so I think this is an awesome point. And yeah, again, like, you know, luckily Polly had gotten in there and developed a relationship, but you know, Steve hadn't.

So I think video cover letters can go over exceptionally well, right? If they don't get an opportunity to meet you because you've shown. That you're willing to put in the effort. They get to know you a little bit. And also you don't want it to be like super rehearsed and polished, right? Because it's just like, hey, like here's who we are.

We're really excited. So I think it almost presenting to camera can be overwhelming for some, but just like the imperfect nature of recording a video cover letter is probably more [00:10:00] trustworthy than just making it super polished and perfect. You know, it's like the energy that you're conveying is more important than like what you're saying or if you, um, in awe and that sort of thing.

Um. So that's awesome. Great. Well, um, competitive situation, uh, she's praying over it, which means, you know, they're probably looking at a number of different variables. Uh, not just the offer itself, but things like working capital inclusions, any earnout or rollover. Um, the likelihood of the person making the offer to close and also the person themselves, the buyer.

So those are usually the variables that they're kind of looking at. It's like, what's your likelihood to close? How confident are we in you as the new owner? Are you gonna get along with people? And then what's the offer look like? Right? So, um, how much cash it close? How much seller financing are they asking me to stay in the business for two years and do a earn out [00:11:00] situation if it's private equity versus somebody that's just gonna do a seller note.

Um, so they'll be weighing up all those different things. You, you had some, uh, not necessarily pushback, but feedback from the broker during this process on your LOI, do you wanna talk about that really quick? Because I think its a good learning for people. So, 

**Steve:** two things. Yeah, two things. Number one, we were the only, they got nine offers.

Uh, we were the only ones that included working capital, so that was kind of really separated us in a bad way. So I know Athena, you and I been probably, we talked it out saying, okay, what is the reality or what kind of working cap, what's, what, what, what's the, what's the likelihood of what we're dealing with?

Uh, is it worth being out of the deal for that? So we pulled that out. Number one, uh, we did move away from, uh, we had offered, uh, 95% cash of, and you know, with an SBA loan and 5% owner financing, we actually ended up raising the price a little bit, uh, and then [00:12:00] going for 10% seller financing. And a lot of that was the broker.

Kind of coaching us, saying, Hey, I think we can get, I think, I can't guarantee, but I think they would go for something like that. Uh, he was really, he was very, uh, he was, he was good in, in a sense to us saying, look, they, you know, the video thing. Kudos to you guys on that one. I think they really like you.

Let me give you a couple of tips and without saying that this will get it close. So we don't know. We we're still waiting. So, um, we'll see if the 10% puts us out. They, they did have an all cash offer, a hundred percent no stipulation. So, uh, you know, just a hundred percent cash. Uh, no, uh, at least one, one, uh, that way.

So yeah, we're, we'll, we'll, we'll see. But it was nice to get the broker, uh, I think Polly can speak to the broker. She, she spoke to them several times and they were really good to work with. 

**Polly:** Yeah, actually it was, it was not Lawrence, it was Casey originally, which she is kind of, I guess she would say the, [00:13:00] the mediary between the, um.

Between the, the client and the prospective buyer. So I kind of dealt, I dealt with her on a couple of different calls and asked a lot of questions, and she was really good with the answers. And then Lawrence, who more or less runs the place, he's the one now who is involved with. All of the offers. And he's the one who called and, you know, told me about the working capital and so forth, and got Steve on the phone.

So he, he was helpful. He was helpful. At least he was, at least he took the time to call and say, this is what we have and I want you guys to get a, you know, a fighting chance too. So, 

**Athena:** well, and that's, that's on the basis of like you making yourself life likable, being great to work with from the broker's perspective.

Like, you know, so there's nine offers on the table. He didn't have to come back to you, but clearly like you're one of the favorite if he is. So that again, speaks to the power of like building a good relationship, not [00:14:00] just with the seller, but with the broker. Being quick, being responsive, like being easy to deal with.

You know, like they get a lot of crap too. So if they like you and they're like, I also like them and my client likes them, so let me give them some tips, you know, to try to make them win. And, um, that goes a long way. So like also, you know, getting your broker bought into you just as much as you want to get the seller bought into you, broker wants to get a deal done and getting a deal done for them is a lot easier when everybody likes each other and works well for each other, you know?

So it's like, obviously like price is gonna be number one for the broker from fee, but then secondary to that will be like, well, what's the actual wire like? And are they gonna be a total nightmare to work with? Do I like them? Like are they gonna get along? So the fact that he was coming back to you and giving you feedback is a great sign.

**Steve:** Polly actually with the broker, even though we've got working with like Live Oak, live Oak, et cetera, [00:15:00] uh, she asked them, Hey, are there preferred lenders that you like to work with? And got a list, whether we use 'em or not was just to kind of, you know, convey, Hey, we, we want to, if you think this is the best way to get it closed, we, we will take some guidance there.

So 

**Athena:** that was really smart actually, because also as you know, brokers get a referral fee from the lenders. They get 1% referral fee. All lenders pay it, it doesn't affect your deal or terms or anything like that. Um, but uh, so brokers will also put you top of their list if they think they're gonna get an extra bite of the F ball.

So even if you don't end up using their lenders indicating that you're open to it before getting into offer can actually put you top of the pack too. So that was smart. 

**Polly:** I, uh, he, or I should say Casey, she asked me, she said, do you want the list of our attorneys too? And I was like, sure. Send them, send them to, [00:16:00] 

**Athena:** I don't think attorneys can pay referral fees actually.

It's like the code of ethics thing. So, you know, but, um, that's great. Yeah. Like, just like, yeah, I would love to work with your people, you know, and to have the exclusivity of a little bit more like, uh, you know, obviously they can't make you use their lender or anything. They don't have the real power to like cancel it at that point if you've like, had a good relationship with the seller.

So, um, smart little tactics to get us in there and get us favored. Um, okay. So you're potentially gonna hear like in the next couple days. Awesome. Right? I think so. Yeah. We'll be, we'll be watching the channels, uh, and, and looking for news. So please, uh, let us know when you hear some feedback, um, excited that you got to this point.

So congratulations getting an LOI out is, and, and negotiating on these different things is, is, you know, it's a big deal and there's a lot of adrenaline running. Um, I'll just pull out the working [00:17:00] capital point too, um, for, for everyone's sake. So this deals on the smaller end, so the working capital won't have that big of an impact overall, which is why we were like, okay, you know, including it in the purchase price and, and then increasing the seller financing.

It didn't break the deal. So sometimes, depending on what the working capital situation is, it's easier to just like, you know, either remove it altogether and lower your purchase price. So you're not trying to educate the broker and the seller because it's not traditional for these much smaller. Deal. And when I say smaller, like the private equity kind of, uh, etiquette around things is coming into smaller and smaller deals.

So these brokers haven't necessarily ever done, you know, working capital included in the deals and you know, it's just like cash free, debt free. Like it's how they do things. So sometimes [00:18:00] it's easier to not try to educate people on how this all works and how it should be, and just adjust your purchase price if you need to.

But in this case, you know. They, they included it, but like made the, the overall number a little bit more attractive to the seller, but left the working capital requirements in there. Nobody else included working capital. So that's smart because if it comes back after they get, start getting into due diligence and looking at financing from the bank, then they've got it under exclusivity.

They've developed a relationship and they can go back to 'em and be like, Hey, this is what we're looking at. Like, we're gonna have to have this much money on day one to be able to pay all your bills, like, work with us on this. You know, as opposed to trying to have that negotiation before you have it under offer and exclusivity.

So, um, great stuff. Good work. Cool. Thank you. Anything else we can help you with or We're just waiting to hear news at this point. Just waiting to hear. Alright, just waiting. We we're, we're waiting [00:19:00] to, we're rooting for this one. It's exciting. Thanks. 

**Polly:** Yeah. I'm gonna, I'm gonna turn my audio off so you don't have to listen to my dog barking right now.

She's right on the cusp of that. 

**Athena:** Amazing. Cool. Um, good work. Cool. Thank you. Well, I'm gonna call, give up next, wanna hear, uh, looks like you've got a meeting scheduled and just kind of started talking tactics and strategies with Ryan on next steps. So, um, give us a quick overview then. How can I or the team be of service to kind of talk through strategy for next steps?

**Gil:** So I have a seller call today at 6:00 PM so another hour and a half. Um, it is, uh, a, the exhibit group, uh, the group that does the, all the, all the, all the, uh, trade shows. Um, very interesting. Uh, I'm very excited to meet the seller. Um, I did some flipping around and I saw, uh, the local Chamber of Commerce interview her during [00:20:00] COVID on Facebook.

So I found that that was an interesting interview. Um, so I know what to expect a little bit. Um, I wrote out a list of questions, um, even without like a small intro for myself. So I, I, I have a, a, a script how to, uh, attack this, uh, this conversation. So my goal of this conversation is, if it goes well, is to finish it with, okay, uh, when can we have a cup of coffee together?

You know, something like that. So that's the goal, um, of what I have going on tonight. 

**Athena:** Right. Cool. And do you know if the broker's gonna be joining the call or is it just you and the seller? It is 

**Gil:** because he arranged for the Zoom meeting he's scheduled. 

**Athena:** Great. Okay. And so what, how are you gonna play this call?

So, it's great that we know the outcome. We want a coffee, so how are you thinking it's gonna go? And then let's stick there and then I'll ask you my next question. 

**Gil:** How do I think it's gonna go? [00:21:00] 

**Athena:** I. Like, what's your plan for this call in particular? 

**Gil:** It's gonna be, uh, it is very heavy on the rapport building.

Uh, I know for example, she, she mentioned in two different places that she wants to retire and travel with her husband. So that's a common point that I have with her. So I'll, I'll, I'll touch on that a little bit. Um, I'll touch on the fact that, you know, I broke my back in enough trade shows myself, um, standing there for 13 hours with batches.

Um, so I, I have some things to break the ice and some things to, to talk to her about. Uh, again, like we said, this is, uh, the first date, so I'm taking that to heart. 

**Athena:** I love it. And, um, super excited about this one 'cause it's not necessarily an industry. That you've worked in, but the industry it serves is when you know deeply and the customer itself, you've been the customer.

So it's so cool to be able to speak to that. Um, and you're big into travel, so I think you'll [00:22:00] connect on that. Something, um, like a, a small gift that I brought to when I found out that like my seller was wanting to travel once they retired, um, you can get a travel map on Amazon and it's, it's got like, um, you can use a coin to like scrape off the countries that you visited and I think it's like 30 bucks and it's on Prime, so you might be able to overnight it, right?

To like, just bring it along to the coffee. Like if the, if you schedule the coffee date, then you can just like, Hey, here's a travel map for when you retire. You know? Um, and just little touches like that, like the, you know, it creates the reciprocity and just the fact that you're like. You know, thinking about her as a person in addition to the business, it goes a long way.

**Gil:** Yeah, that's correct. Um, 

**Athena:** so, uh, what Ryan was also saying, it might be worth talking through what, what happens at the coffee date? Have you gotten that far or you just kind of focused on, on this [00:23:00] one next? 

**Gil:** Uh, I'm focused on this one. We haven't gone that far. No. Uh, we said that we'll circle back if it, uh, comes to fruition.

**Athena:** Okay, cool. How are you feeling about it? Anything we can do to help or get you motivated for it sounds like I'm very 

**Gil:** motivated. I'm, I'm psyched for this. Uh, I'm, I'm really looking forward to it 'cause I'm, I'm excited about this deal, uh, from what I've seen on the paper, and I hope that today goes well.

**Athena:** Amazing. Well, cool. Sounds like you're in a great place. And then, uh, if, if you get that coffee date scheduled, then we can kind of talk through strategy for that when that happens. But I think about, you know, the travel map or something like that if you really like her and you know, depending on how competitive you think it is, like just those little touches can really make you stand out.

Um, Anka can we dig out the link from, it's on my Amazon account, actually 'cause it on the travel map. And maybe just shoot it over to Gail really quick so he doesn't have to research [00:24:00] it if it's helpful. Yeah, no worries. Um, great. Cool. Anything else we can help with at this stage? 

**Gil:** Uh, no. I have two other deals that are in the fire right now.

Uh, one I have to make a blind offer on, uh, 'cause only after that they'll start taking you in to start talking to you. Uh, and Juan, I am, uh, chasing the broker. Um, last, he emailed me on Friday. I emailed him back, uh, uh, on Monday. I haven't heard back yet, so I'll wait till tomorrow. Tomorrow I'll ping him again and then, uh, see where we are.

**Athena:** Yeah. Gil's, Gil's in a situation with a couple of these deals where the brokers are kind of reverting to questions and gatekeeping pretty seriously. So, um, Gil's been active and persistent and like, hi, I'm still here. Um, any, any, uh, you feel good on, on the one in particular where you're having to do questions only or make a 

**Gil:** blind [00:25:00] offer?

I am fine on both steps. The one with the questions only, I shot him another set of three questions. Very simple ones. Yeah. Um, on Friday, and I haven't heard back from him yet. So I'm, I'm comfortable with him. And then once he answers them and say, okay, I'm ready to meet the sellers, can we make, can we arrange for something?

The one with the offer. Um, sure. It's, it's not binding and I can make an offer and then we can start negotiating afterwards if they wanna talk to me. But, uh, it's a very, in my opinion, risky business, uh, for where technology and, uh, politics is at these days. So I'm going to make a offer on the lower side, on a three multiple, uh, and then take it from there.

**Athena:** Yeah. Um, Ryan talks about that a lot with y'all. Like, you know, what, what number would it be a no brainer for you? And it might not be what they want, but, you know, it's like, well, does that change things if. If I [00:26:00] adjust the price to what I want versus what they want, does that change how I feel about this deal?

And sometimes that can be a really interesting exercise to go through when you're playing around with the modeling and stuff and it's like, well, hang on a minute, at this price, I'm getting really excited about it. So if, if it feels like it's kind of a loss anyway, at, at whatever they're asking, there's no harm in submitting an offer, even an indication of interest at that point and saying like, here's where I'm at with it for these reasons.

You know, if, if you wanna continue conversations, then we can do that, um, on the, um, blind offer. So, you know, it's just gonna keep getting more and more competitive for on market deals. Um, and oftentimes the, the only way that brokers know how to control that. And Gil, I'm saying this for the, the benefit of the group too.

'cause I know we've talked about this, but Yeah. Um. [00:27:00] We, we operate off, you know, the information that we have to the best of our ability when we're making offers and we're being gate kept from having conversations or getting more financials. So, you know, I think everybody's super high integrity and it's like, well, if I make an offer, I don't wanna change it after the fact.

And it's like, well, if they're giving you very limited information in which to make, uh, an offer, then you're just gonna have to operate off the information that you have and know that it's very possible. Likely after the fact when you get tax returns or when you get to meet the owner or whatever, that things are gonna change.

So I think it's probably shortsighted of the brokers to not at least pick favorites and have them do like seller meetings and stuff rather than getting under offer with somebody. And it's like, well, what if you totally have a personality clash after you get under offer? So that's the thing. It's like, as long as you're using, you know, a pre reviewed legal template, it's, it's only binding around exclusivity and [00:28:00] confidentiality, but you, you're not bound to buy the business.

Um, so, you know. To the best of your ability. Make an offer, make one that feels comfortable with the limited information that you have. Um, and then, or make it a little bit, you know, competitive, not like something that's like, well if everything checks out, then I think I could make these numbers work, or mitigate the risk that you perceive beforehand and, and submit an offer that way.

So sometimes we do have to just make offers of limited information and, and tell the broker like, Hey, you haven't given me the things that I need. Um, I haven't had a conversation with the seller, so if everything checks out, then this is, this is where I'm at. Yeah. But, you know, I'd love to get a little bit more information beforehand so that I can make sure that this is solid.

But if they don't, then you just, you know, we shouldn't feel bad to know that we're probably gonna have to change things after we get under offer if, if they kept things from us [00:29:00] that we needed to be able to give them a full, fully baked offer. 

Yeah. 

**Athena:** Cool. Cool. Great. Good luck tonight. Send us a little update tonight or tomorrow and let us know what the outcome was and how we can support from there.

Awesome. Great. I think I saw Justin here somewhere. Justin, are you around? 

**Justin:** I'm around. 

**Athena:** Awesome. Um, so I was in the midst of a movie yesterday. Any, any updates on, on the big one we were working on? 

**Justin:** Um, no. They received it and confirmed that, um, that's it. Yeah. Owner's like, Hey, thanks for jumping through hoops, being late to the party, um, with all of their, uh, Lois and interest they've received.

But, uh, he got it and he said, we'll, we'll be, uh, reviewing all of them now. And, and I'm a part of that. So, uh, question. It sounds like questions are still open. Should I have them? If they have them, but it's kind of been a holding pattern as far as that one goes right now. 

**Athena:** Okay, [00:30:00] great. And just give us a quick, everybody, a, a quick update on what happened and how you got to where you're at now.

So 

**Justin:** yeah, so this was, uh, the latest opportunity, um, that Luke helped bring to the table. Um, but by the time I got to it, it had been listed for a few months already. The broker, uh, it's a roofing company and the broker specializes in roofing specifically, uh, and has a very structured process for how he recommends his, his clients evaluate, um, interest.

And basically what he did was kind of hold an open period where they were collecting a number of Lois iis any kind of interest from the market. And then I, I don't know to what extent they actually looked at, and they didn't really divulge that, but it sounded like they were just kind of, the broker was leaving this as an open period.

Um, and then after and, and then closing the window and then evaluating all of them at once, kind of side by side. [00:31:00] So I guess they could get an apples to apples comparison. I was the last to the table, so they had been sitting on some, some other offers for weeks, potentially months maybe. I, I don't know.

But, um, they were about to close their window right when I caught wind did it. So I've been kind of under the gun trying to, uh, get an interest if, if I was to submit an LOI get interest in front of them as quickly as possible. A broker was super nice and very conducive to getting in front of the seller.

He actually recommended I do it quickly, so I did that. Um, then I had a follow up call with the seller as well to, you know, try to ask a couple additional questions that came to mind. Again, seller's really nice, I really liked them as people, uh, so that's fun. Um, but yeah, so in a matter of, you know, I met the seller and within a few days, I mean, give or take maybe a handful of days, I had an LOI in front of him, which I submitted to on, well, yesterday, I guess.

Yeah. Um, so there's gonna be all these 

**Athena:** allies. It's so exciting. Yeah. Um, so, [00:32:00] uh, with this one, you know, it sounds like it kind of left it open just a little bit longer for you to eek in there because from, from the feedback they were giving you, you were kind of the favored error, right? 

**Justin:** Don't know if, I dunno if I was the favor, but they liked me.

I'll put it that way. A lot of the, it's a sizable deal. I mean, outside of the scope, I thought I was even going to entertain. So I think at this point it was catching the attention of private equity. So many of the offers they've received have been pe and the seller did tell me directly, he goes, I, I would rather not sell to pe all things equal, um, because I'd rather sell to a guy like you as an owner operator and you know, someone I can entrust the business with.

So for what that's worth, I mean, that's can't hurt. Um, that said, I do think at the end of the day they're still very. Financially minded and evaluating the offers from what is the best, you know, position that the seller's being put in. So as much as I love [00:33:00] the, you know, we like you and we'd love to tell to you, you know, who knows if it's actually enough to sway, you know, dropping a couple million dollars on the offer, because that's basically what I'm kind of asking compared to some of the other offers they've gotten.

**Athena:** Supposedly, right. He was supposedly 

**Justin:** so It's all hearsay. It's all was the, imagine if there was one 

**Athena:** at the higher end, right? Like that they were saying was actually there. Then why, why would they have been leaving it open this long? 

**Justin:** Yeah. Well, he did say that, that there was hair on it for the seller that he didn't love.

Like there was, you know, you know, either a, an earnout component or a, or a rollback component or heavily involvement required from the seller, which he doesn't want. So, you know, yes, there, there may have been some extra zeros, but then it also came with attachments. Right. And, um, I tried to minimize the attachments from as much as I could in my offer, but still make it financially viable for me, uh, to make sense.

So, um, we'll see. Yeah, we'll, we'll see if I'm in contention or not, but, uh, apparently they've got [00:34:00] eight 10 offers on the table. 

**Athena:** Yeah. And then when you sent it over, did you allude to like being flexible on any of the things that you sent? 

**Justin:** Yeah. Uh, yeah, I, I mean, as much as I can be, I didn't wanna play any cards, you know, too openly at this point, because I just don't know where it all stands.

And I don't know what's hearsay and what's factual, but I did say, you know, I'm here for questions. You know, if, if there's anything, I think a position, like if there's any, if there's anything you've gotten that, you know, gives reservation, like I'm an open book, let's talk about it, kind of thing. Um, so trying to facilitate a conversation to at least uncover where there might be a hangup as far as, you know, their consideration for, for my offer.

Um, but yeah, I mean, like I said, as far as the financial go, this is stretching me to the nth degree for, for, for me. So I really can't be too flexible in a number of ways, um, and still make it work. Uh, but, you know, hey, who knows? Maybe, maybe [00:35:00] there's a shot in the dark. They're like, I like this guy enough.

Let's, let's give it a crack. 

**Athena:** And, and I think that thing is like getting your foot in the door, showing you're serious. If they like you and they're like, willing to work with you on the offer, then there's, there's different levers that we can pull particularly on something like this. So when you were looking at the structure, you know, and, you know, potentially entertaining investor equity and stuff like that, like how did that all feel?

**Justin:** Uh, it, it was a different notion for me just because I had, I had gone into this pretty steadfast and not wanting kind of input, uh, from, from other investors. I think part of it is just, uh, you know, I've, I've had many partners in various capacities and like real estate investments and, you know, some have been great.

Some have not been great. And so it's just, it adds a different level of complexity potentially to, you know, to a deal. So I'd always had in my vision, you know, smaller deals Okay. If I own it all and, and can kind of control that go forward. I [00:36:00] think this one was just, it was interesting enough that, and the growth was meteoric in nature year over year, that it was a, an anomaly from what I've been looking at in the market, quite honestly.

And so because of that, I was trying to make extenuating circumstances for what it would take to get into it. Um, yeah, and for that reason, as, as a, an outlying situation, I, I would evaluate, you know, some investor potential for something like this. Um, and it would still be okay. I mean, I'm okay with it. I think it all comes down to, you know, who are those people and how does that working dynamic?

Uh, 

**Athena:** yeah. I mean, we're in a, so just again, for the benefit of the group, if, if there's a bigger. Deal they get really excited about. We're in a state right now where businesses are kind of the hot investment vehicle for investors. Like, and there's quite a few. They don't necessarily want to be involved.

They just need somewhere [00:37:00] to put their cash. Right? Because the markets, we obviously all know what's going on with that. Um, real estate isn't delivering the returns that it used to. So, um, and I normally am like, don't bring in investors, right? Like when you're a startup, I. But the, the economics on this, you can give a very small portion of equity.

You can limit their, their inputs. Right? You can make them limited partners. So you're the one that, like, you can inhabit all of the board seats, so it's like you have control of the business. That's where things shifted. For me personally, when I went out and raised all that money, because I've always been like, I, I've raised investment before for my past businesses and oh my gosh, like, like, you know, but when you're a startup and you're raising investment, like they have the leverage in this situation, you do, you found the deal, you're gonna be operating it, you know, you're putting a personal guarantee on the line and there's so many people that are interested in being involved in these [00:38:00] types of deals that you can set your terms and basically like take it or leave it, you know?

Mm-hmm. It's not, it's much less of a desperation. Like we got a seed round glass series a runway. It's like you can walk away from this deal. Right? Like, so there's so much more. Control that you have and the way that you structure it, that it, it becomes really interesting. And what I particularly like to think about, like if you're entertaining a deal where you might wanna bring investors, is can you find investors that could actually add exceptional value to the business they have, you know, they're kind of retired and have experience in this, or they have a network that, you know, they could introduce you to.

So, um, I worked on a. Crazy deal last year that, um, they needed to raise a fair bit of investor money and they found some, you know, guys in their neighborhood [00:39:00] that just had amazing networks that would've like doubled the revenue overnight. And they're like, we're done operating. We did that. Right? Like, we just wanna be a, and, and, you know, you can find these, these folks that have like so much wisdom and they, they, you know, maybe retired or sold their business, but they still wanna remain relevant and feel, but they don't wanna do the all the crazy day-to-day stuff.

So you can get this mentor that has amazing background experience, but like literally does not want to be involved in the day-to-day. They just wanna support someone. So you can find really interesting investors that way. Or like for, um, a deal of this size then that unlocks the opportunity to get private debt.

So it's, it's people, there's funds. Of, of investors where they lend versus like doing it as equity. So, but they like larger deals. So then, yeah, you know, you can look at going to these folks. They like the deal to be under [00:40:00] offer first. Um, so that's the only thing with it. But they might do a mix of debt and equity too.

And like you can say like, well this is my long term aim. It's a buy and hold. I'm not like, flipping it, this is the terms, you know, take it or leave it. And if they don't like it, there's so many other people that do it. So, sorry, that was a little bit of a rant, but just, you know, my, my take and reiterating it for everybody here, these larger deals can sometimes be super interesting and kind of perfect for your skillset.

And the one that we love about this is like, the model that he's cracked is something that you can easily replicate and, and to other markets. There's a real interesting opportunity there too. 

**Justin:** Yeah. Yeah. I, I agree. And, and I've seen a lot of that, uh, kind of fund or private investment interest to even post, like on search funder regularly.

Either people offering a deal and, and then a bunch of investors saying, Hey, we want to [00:41:00] be limited partners, or, you know, we wanna park some cash somewhere. Or the inverse is just people posting around, Hey, I, I'm looking to part cash, does anyone have a deal? And, you know, and these are, these are all people I don't even know yet.

But maybe a simple post could, could garner some, some intrigue there. But, uh, I, I agree. I mean, and I like the idea of keeping this out of a bank, traditional bank if possible. Only 'cause, you know, banks are fine, but, you know, I, my, the best real estate deals I've done have had no bank involvement. And there's, uh, something that I just like about that just kind of keeping it with, uh, with investors and, and, you know.

If there's, uh, a PG element that we can minimize or mitigate, uh, then all the better, right? Um, yeah, yeah, 

**Athena:** yeah. And so with that, if you do, 'cause this, this could be a para pursue with SBA and you bring in investor money to make up that equity injection, and then you're sharing a risk, right, with like, at least the [00:42:00] risk of the capital injection.

Or you go to private lenders and, and they don't have a pg, but you're under the ones, you know, and they might, they might want a piece of the equity also for the risk depending on it. So, or a higher interest rate. Um, so once it's under offer, um, then we have people in our network that we can make introductions to, depending on the deal, all that, that we know.

So, but for these, you know, investment private debt. They want it under LOI first, you know, because they, they, you know, it's like that's more, that's the deal flow that they're ready to invest in. 'cause there's more of a, you know, real opportunity there in front of 'em. So, yeah. 

**Justin:** And, and, and real estate, whenever I was raising, when I've raised, not a lot, but it was always a soft commit if I didn't have a deal.

Just kinda like, Hey, if I had something, would you even be interested? And then they're like, sure. You know, when you get something, show me. And they're like, cool. Got it. And then I would get something then bring it tangible. 'cause like, here's the [00:43:00] deal, you know? Um, so it was like a, a tiered system for, for getting investor interest.

**Athena:** Yeah. Um, when, when I, so one of the best things I ever learned was like, when you want money, ask for advice. I'm like, yeah, what advice? Ask for money, right? Yep. And so like startups would go out and raise money all the time and they'd ask for money and then they'd just get investors that would like give up a ton of advice.

So when I knew, I knew, 

**Justin:** yeah, that's happened. Yeah. Already just meeting other searchers and telling what I was doing. I did get coffee and I'd tell 'em what I was doing and my background. They're like, are you, are you looking for investment? I was like, no, we didn't even talk about it. They're like, well, if you do, lemme know.

I was like, alright. Yeah. 

**Athena:** So making a list of anyone and everyone, and this is for everybody to do. You never know when you might wanna get a little extra equity, you may never use it, but anyone that you talk to about what you're doing, the kinds of returns that you're seeing, you know the fact [00:44:00] you can leverage the SBA, those sorts of things.

People are like, oh gosh, I'd love to invest in something like that. I just made a list of everybody that indicated any sort of interest that I knew had capital potentially to invest. And so then when I actually had a deal in hand. I got in touch with them and I'm like, Hey, I have like this serious time crunch.

I'm freaking out. This deal is amazing. I would love your advice. You know, like, can we schedule a coffee? And so I told every single one of 'em like, here's the numbers, here's how it's been performing, here's the situation that I'm in. I need to raise this much by this time. What do you think? And they're like, what's the minimum?

Every single one, every single one. Like didn't ask for money. I was just like, what do you think? You know? And they're like, oh, wow. This is so, so it all depends on you pitching the opportunity, them, you, all those sorts of things. But, um, when you start making that list of people, like if you ever need it, right, like then, then at least you have them warm.

You know that they're potentially interested in it, and you can go and run the deal by 'em [00:45:00] and see what they think. And, you know. Worst, you're gonna get advice at best. You might get some offers of money from somebody that you would generally want to keep getting advice from on the deal, which is where I was like, oh, I, I really am excited about having investors on something this big because I'll have people incentivize to answer the phone whenever I call, that might have charged me a thousand dollars an hour or whatever, you know, to get, get mentorship from them or not ever make time for me.

Mm-hmm. So I would start thinking about those kinds of folks in your personal network already. If there's anyone that you know that would be like a great advisor to you, when are, when are you potentially gonna hear back? 

**Justin:** I don't, they didn't gimme a timeline. They don't have a, a, a date on when they're gonna like, select or close the evaluation now that they've got everything in hand.

So I'm kind of playing it by ear. I mean, I, if I asked, they'd probably gimme an indication. Um, I've gotten the seller who's everything was, you know. Via the seller and broker's emails, like [00:46:00] CCing, and we're all kind of looped in. And then the sellers, you know, was originally feeding me information coming from the broker, and then eventually he just started emailing me directly.

I mean, CCing the broker still, but now we've got a, Hey, his name's John's, like John, like, do you know any, I mean, he'd probably just tell me, yeah, we'll probably looking at this end of this week or next week or whatever, so I could probably find out if I needed to. 

**Athena:** Great. Okay. Um, how are you feeling overall?

What's your gut feeling on this one? 

**Justin:** I go question mark who? I have no idea. I mean, it feels fine. Uh, you know, if there, if I, I'll be, I'll be surprised if they entertain my offer, I'll put it that way, just because I, I, yeah, not, not a bad way. Just genuinely surprised given the offers that they've, I've been told they're on the table.

And then the, the goal for the seller to get the highest cash and, you know, the largest number of zeros attached [00:47:00] to it. So, uh, but like I said, who knows? Who knows? We'll see. It's been, it's been, uh, if nothing else, it's been really educational, just going through the motions, dialing in more on the modeling, filling out the OI, you know, all of that.

So getting reps in there I think will help facilitate the workflow even better. 

**Athena:** Absolutely. And. When you are learning at the same time you're delivering, it feels like you're moving really fast. But sometimes in these competitive situations, it's not. So just getting to this point is a huge win because if, for whatever reason this one doesn't come through, you'll know what you're doing next time.

You know, you've been through it. Mm-hmm. So it's like, okay, get the model out, do this, do that. Like here's the levers that it can pull so it, it hits differently when you're doing it yourself and adrenaline's pumping on a deal that you've had that personal relationship with the broker and the owner versus watching someone else do it.

Wouldn't you say? 

**Justin:** Oh, for sure. Well, and especially that, this is the first one I've been on such a time crunch, like, you [00:48:00] know, the other two that I've been looking at were more like, uh, you 

know, 

**Justin:** when you get to it, not, not competitive, you know, that kind of thing. And this one's like, we have nine offers. You better get yours in in four, eight hours.

**Athena:** It's crazy. Well, um, great work on that and, and something for, um, you and Steven Polly and anyone else where you're in a competitive situation, but you have a good relationship with the broker. If for whatever reason you don't get, I would take the opportunity to ask the broker for a call to get some feedback on, you know, like, Hey, would've loved to get this one you mind jumping on the phone really quick to, so I can capture some learnings and feedback from you.

If not, maybe they can do it over email, but, you know, for you to get direct and I find phone call easier because they'll probably more willing to divulge stuff than like writing it in an email. But if you have a good relationship and you don't win it, then why? What were the reasons or what could you have done differently to try to win the deal?

To give you some insights for future ones, because [00:49:00] might be variables that you didn't even know, or you just get an indication of like how far off you were from, you know, the offer that won and what those variables were. And then the other thing to do is if you love the deal, you don't get it. Keep the broker warm.

Right. Keep checking in regularly because especially on, on these super competitive ones, somebody might have been doing the dumb cowboy thing that the Internet's telling people to do and just blast out, like over asking Lois to get it under exclusivity and then it falls apart when they try to retrade it.

So this is just like. Cowboy thing that's happening, but people are making like really high offers. Get it under exclusivity, try to retr it, deal falls apart, or they're like, yeah, it's all cash. And then they change it and they're like, actually we're gonna get debt on this one. So, which happened on my deal.

So I like, I mean it took nine months for them to close on the one that I lost. I kept [00:50:00] checking in with the broker. 'cause you could be front of mind if that thing, like guess what? You were pretty much next in line. So, um, I mean the teams see it all the time and we're pretty good about catching 'em and they go back on market, but keeping that conversation live just in case it falls out is a great thing.

**Justin:** Yep, for sure. 

**Athena:** Nice work on that. Uh, so just real quick, are you, what's, what's, what's, where's your mind at, with the furniture one or the design one? Are you gonna keep moving that one along? Duty data? Yeah, 

**Justin:** yeah, yeah, yeah. Moving that along. That one's probably the, the least. I mean, there's no, there's no other offer.

They're not even, I, yeah. Like, it's kind of a calm in the background one, but I am, I am kind of still working towards, uh, you know, further valuation and, and trying to put something, you know, in, in front of the, uh, the seller. That makes sense. But, um, yeah, so it was, everything's still moving forward. This was just taking precedent because it, uh, it was so timely.

But you 

**Athena:** And big, yeah. And exciting. Massive. Yeah. And 

**Justin:** [00:51:00] huge and massive. This one. 

**Athena:** Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Great 

**Justin:** work. 

**Athena:** Awesome. Anything else we can help you with today? 

**Justin:** Uh, 

I don't think so. Yeah. 

**Athena:** Great work. Awesome. We'll keep us posted. Obviously, let us know in the channels if anything transpires or if we can jump in and help at all.

Will do. 

**Athena:** Awesome. Great. Well, um, we are. Kind of wrapping up. But um, you know, something that the team fed back to me is, uh, you know, thinking about perfection when it comes to offers and like how perfect does it need to be. So I'll touch on that, but real quickly, um, next Thursday or this coming Thursday, you know, we've been getting really great feedback from y'all on how helpful it is to dive in the models and do that.

So we wanna spend more time on the modeling. So I'll pull that up and we'll talk to you through different things. So any questions that you have about, can I do this, or how can I do this? Or how can I be more competitive? Like, please, please, [00:52:00] please come on Thursday and like, ask those questions. Or if there's still an area of like financials that you don't understand, like it's been really great to work through that with you all and it's easier when I can like, pull it up and kind of show you the different ways of doing that.

And it seems like from the feedback we've been getting from you all, it's helpful for you too. Really where we wanna get you is feeling confident with those numbers, that it's like plug and play and you're like, okay, I know what levers I can pull to change things. Um, and we're constantly adding little updates to, so, um, always make sure that you're making a new copy of the latest one.

'cause when we get that feedback, we're just like, okay, let's add that. Like, it's, it's fun to have all those features in there. So, um, we will keep talking through financials, but just something to think about when you're making an offer is, you know, and I, I, I touched on this earlier, but there's no way to get it perfect when you're making an offer.

'cause it's just like, there's [00:53:00] so many things happening and usually you're on a time crunch or you have limited information, uh, available. So, you know, the way I like to think about it is like, if everything checks out the way that they say and if, if the business goes. Okay. After I take it over, like, what's, what's the worst that can happen?

You know, like what are my biggest issues that I have with moving forward? What's the li what's the least amount of information I need at this point to be able to make a decision on whether I want to move forward and make an offer? And while I don't condone the cowboy thing of making like super crazy competitive, you know, all cash, high price, just to know that you're gonna retrade it.

We're in a situation where we're just operating off whatever information is in front of us and sometimes not able to get more information. Or we're on a time crunch. So if you have a million questions that you need [00:54:00] answered before you buy the business, that's okay and, and expected, right? We want you to have tons of questions as you go through this process, but just thinking about what do I need to have answered before I make a decision on if I wanna propose?

Right, and like, and make an offer on this business. And then immediately after getting it under exclusivity, what do I need to clear up before I start paying people money? So there's, there's, you kind of have this like delineation with the LOI. It's like, well, to the best of my ability, do I have enough information to be like, this is exciting enough for me to make an offer.

And get it to the point where I, I have the right to be able to ask as many questions as I want. You know? So just thinking about that when you're making these offers. 'cause we're never gonna have all the information that we want at LOI like never. Right? So it's the least amount. The minimum effective dose that would be right.

What's the minimum amount of information that I need to be able [00:55:00] to move forward on this deal, knowing that what comes next is really putting this thing completely under the lens. You know, so like, you're going to be then going to lenders and they're gonna, uh, give it a, you know, deep dive under the hood before they will even get you a proposal, which means that they've had a bunch of questions that they get answered.

Then after that, you're gonna have a QV, which somebody that really knows their way around this, you're gonna have, you know, legal up in there. You're gonna be having insurance up in there. So you have all these people after you get it under offer that are going to ask the questions that you might not have thought of in addition to all the questions that you want answered.

So, um, LOI, we wanna, we wanna be like, you know, from, I'm operating from the place of if everything checks out the way that they say, I would feel good about this. You know, like I hope everything is the way that it is, that all these issues that I'm, I have in my head aren't gonna be issues. If [00:56:00] not, then this feels like a good opportunity for me to move forward on.

And I know that I have the opportunity once I get under offer to ask a zillion more questions. And there's a whole team of really awesome people that have a ton of experience that are gonna look at it from every single direction that I've never even thought of that are also gonna have a bunch of great questions and support me through this process before I sign on the dotted line, right?

Like it's a a hundred page loan document that you have to sign and sign away your life and go through all that, that there's so many steps before you get to that point of putting your house on the line to make sure. So I hope that helps a little bit. Just like take the Y is a big deal, but it's still a malleable.

Thing at the point that you're making an offer, because there's so much to be found out, discovered, explored, stress tested after you get an under offer. And that's really what we're trying to do, is we're trying to get exclusivity to, you know, get the [00:57:00] permission to look under the hood, take the clothes off, right?

Like, so I was like, okay, you feel comfortable with me now to open the kimono? And that's what we're gonna do, is I'm, I'm gonna figure out absolutely everything going on to make sure I still feel good about putting, you know, a personal guarantee on this business. Does that make sense for everybody? Yeah.

But it's cool. It's fun, it's exciting. It feels like a really big deal. But, um, you know, we just wanna win the opportunity to, to open the kimono, which, you know, once we do that, we might be like, I don't like what I see here, so I can walk away. And you can walk away and there's gonna be a bunch of people, us included, looking at this with you to be like, I don't know about this.

You know? So like, well, you know, you've got a bunch of. Other folks that will help you make a more educated decision once you get that opportunity. So that being said, um, great as always, catch up with you all. Lots of exciting movement. Please keep us updated. We're all like, just, you know, [00:58:00] awaiting good news or any news and so we can support you.

Um, Ryan's back as well as, you know. So full team is in force. Um, and then Thursday we'll just spend more time on, uh, find the financial modeling template. So please, please, please, if you can, um, between now and then, just think of any questions that you might have and we'll do it like we did last time where I'll walk you through any new features that we've added and then you can ask all the questions and I can kind of show you how it works in the, the thing.

So it's like Athena, how do we put in investor money or, um, you know, how do we figure out, uh, working capital or maintenance CapEx or you know, what, what, how can we scenario plan, whatever it is that you're just like hitting a roadblock when you're doing this stuff. Um, this is where we can, you know, get into the spreadsheet and help y'all out there.

So thank you so much. Have a great rest of your day and we'll see you on Thursday. Bye [00:59:00] everyone.
