  really struggled with um Lindsey and Kevin, you know.

0:03 - Luke Gillespie
  Okay, interesting.

0:05 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  That being said with Lindsey and Kevin, we were only doing um on market for them. That was back when we had like packages where people could choose on or off market.

0:14 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah.

0:15 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So they were only on market and we did like a one month off market search. So it'll be interesting to see what Justin adding the off market does anything but there's like hundreds of searchers here.  So they all don't want to leave Austin. So like probably every business owner has been hit up five weeks from Sunday about selling their business, you know.

0:43 - Luke Gillespie
  Okay. It's just so competitive.

0:46 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  That's why it's tough. I don't know why there's so many searchers here.

0:50 - Luke Gillespie
  Like mean Austin's been one of the most booming cities in the country ever since COVID. it's it's understandable.

1:00 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah. Um, well, I'm looking to get out.

1:03 - Luke Gillespie
  So really, you don't love Austin.

1:06 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Oh, and I were just talking. She's a good thing. the only thing you like about Austin is on it, my gym.

1:12 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah. Oh, wait.

1:15 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  We're not a cult, but like we're, we're family, you know, it's a brand that everybody's like really proud to be a part of the community.  There is amazing. But I only got into weightlifting because it's the normal stuff that I do like silks and poll just wasn't really an option where I lived.

1:28 - Luke Gillespie
  Okay.

1:29 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  But when I went down to Costa Rica, like that's all I was doing. Like I was just doing circus training like five days week.  That makes me ridiculously happy. So I'd like to try out different cities and see what like the vibe is like in the circus training and be close to the ocean or just go back down to to loom or Costa Rica and hang out for bit.

1:52 - Luke Gillespie
  Awesome. So we're know that into after you lease ones out.

1:57 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Oh, I got to figure that out. It's just like every time the least comes up. I'm like, what am I doing?  know, like, existential crisis of like, and the renewal rates are like so high. Like, if I was to go month to month, yeah, it's like double what like the cost of a 12 month monthly rate is.  So it's it's getting to the point where this place was super cheap. But I'm like, I don't want to commit to another six months.  And if I went month to month and it's just it's too much money for a place that I don't feel super like attached to, you know, yeah, month to month is always tough.

2:34 - Luke Gillespie
  I found that when I was looking in Mexico, right? how how do you find your housing when you're no matter?

2:40 - AcquiMatch Team
  Yeah, I I actually like it because I just I really minimized my life as I traveled. And I got to the point where when I'm kind of running out of place, it doesn't bother me that much because I just I just grab another apartment and place looks cool or beautiful or interesting and I just go there.  kind of just like an exciting opportunity, you know, the problem is like, if you have a lot of stuff, it makes it each time of track.  Yeah, I got a pack of my stuff, I got to do this, but if you minimize your stuff, it doesn't really bother me.

3:15 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, that's and that's what I meant. But like, the month to month, it's not the lifestyle that I struggle with.  It's the fact that they double the rent here to do like a month to month thing. I would rather have, I don't like contracts, right?  Like, because I want to be able to like move and do that sort of thing if I want to.  But there's this thing called Hello Landing that I was looking at like six months ago, and it's $1,500 a month membership to go and live in these beautiful apartments, kind of in different places all over the US.  The only problem is like, the standby membership is like, they can give you three days notice to get out if somebody books it longer term.  there's yeah, three days is pretty quick, but if you pick the cities that have like a bunch of properties available, then you might just have to move to a different property in the city.  Or you like, you know, go on Airbnb get something for like a month or whatever. So yeah, but anyway, it's like the existential crisis, the lease is up like now what?

4:23 - Luke Gillespie
  And they make you give two months notice here too.

4:25 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So it's like my lease isn't even up until end of April, but you have to give 60 days written notice if you're going to be okay.

4:32 - Luke Gillespie
  Oh, interesting. Yeah, I like your idea on the minimalism thing. Did I tell you I got the high path backpack?  put me on outside and I'm living on it. I'm just gonna bring like two pairs of shoes, have like three pairs of pants and just just rock it.

4:49 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Oh my god, I feel like one pair of shoes. Oh my god, think you guys

6:00 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah, interesting. I was going to say, I was hoping you were going to say that they were like those, you know, those barefoot shoes that I like.

6:06 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Oh, my God. Oh, God. I told my boyfriend, like, if you ever were like, we're breaking up immediately, if you have any shoe that separates your toes, like this, we're done.

6:17 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah, those ones are hilarious.

6:19 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  I worked out without shoes. Like, when I do my weightlifting, I wear socks or a barefoot.

6:25 - Luke Gillespie
  Oh, nice. I love that. Yeah, I love doing everything barefoot.

6:28 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  And it's good for your feet. It is.

6:31 - AcquiMatch Team
  That's really good center.

6:33 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Oh, OK, so you have a good class too.

6:35 - AcquiMatch Team
  All right. I the I love the way it was, like, those are super easy to pack, you know. And then it needs to go out in that choice.

6:44 - Luke Gillespie
  Nice. Yeah, I got like a pair of bands, like just black and white, the Velcro bands, those are just going to be like my everything shoes.  And I'm just very minimalizing my fashion and my outfits, you know, so I'm looking forward to it, though, but I can't do it.  I got I got to have at least one pair of like casual sneakers and one pair of like hiking their athletic shoes So that's what I What I do is I cuz I high thought I buy a pair hiking shoes when I get to a place Yeah, I throw them away.

7:15 - AcquiMatch Team
  I just give them to the apartment Because you can find good quality shoes I can choose yeah for $20 true It goes to the local like just the look that it's not America's club to the cathode Go to the cathode south America.  have like 20-25 dollars use them for two months Yeah, just give them to somebody and then if you go somewhere else, that's what I do Yeah, that's a good idea.

7:40 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  That's what I was thinking I was thinking of like not even bringing socks and just buying those every place I go So, you know, what's happening tomorrow Well Well, I'm just getting on a plane for the first time.

7:53 - AcquiMatch Team
  Oh, that's tomorrow Just better good luck.

7:58 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So I was giving her tips on the plane, you know for the plane I was like, of course, they sent her a book recommendation for something that's going on in her life right now.  I was like, download it, read it on the plane. And she's like, I didn't even think what I was going to do on the plane.  I was like, yeah, you're not going to Wi-Fi. But she's getting on a plane for the first time. That was like, it was my goal last year for her.  So we're two months late that she got on a plane, but we're there.

8:21 - AcquiMatch Team
  Great for her.

8:22 - Luke Gillespie
  She's nervous.

8:24 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, but I think she's super excited too, because she's checked me in and all the people that she worked with.  She's like, check people in for flights, you know, but she's never actually done it for herself. So it's a big step.  And you know, like, this is how it starts, right? it was like my, even though she's like flying within South Africa to a place she's been before, like when I actually started traveling as an adult by myself, like that's when I was like, more of this, you know?

8:54 - Luke Gillespie
  That's awesome.

8:55 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, I'm excited for her. Cool. So where are we at? What are you? Okay, I'm going to chat through today.

9:03 - AcquiMatch Team
  Um, so last time we went actually through everything I had. So what was you, Luke, you start. So then I'll just give my update stuff.  There was, there was one on the client.

9:13 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  I wanted to ask you a question about, Oh, JB, are we introducing him to lenders? What's his plan there?

9:29 - AcquiMatch Team
  Yeah, we're introducing lenders. So he's, he's not concerned about all the girls.

9:34 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  What's that?

9:35 - AcquiMatch Team
  He's talking to our folks.

9:37 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay, great. Um, fantastic. Cool. Okay. Yeah. over to you.

9:42 - Luke Gillespie
  Okay. Yes. So some updates of what's been going on. So Ryan's doing an off market right up for Chris.  That's going to be going to him soon. Yeah. So so that's happening. And then as far as riders are concerned, so we have those two DL right up, ready, Ryan's just scheduling a time with DL to meet.  them and talk them through that first write up. Um, what else I finished that, uh, the SP gradient excavation right up to them.  It looks like they said they're not interested, but maybe that's something you will want to have Ryan to push back on and question them, because they seem to be really interested at first.  I think I included like one screenshot about the license about how hard it was to get. And I feel like that may have thrown them off and given that they're such jittery clients of ours, maybe they got a little scared off by that.  I'm thinking, I don't know, Ryan, did you see their message and Polly's message?

10:34 - AcquiMatch Team
  What was the answer of the license?

10:37 - Luke Gillespie
  So, uh, let me look back over my write up. Um, excuse me. Uh, yeah, so they do some pipe work, which requires this contractor's manager's license.  And the purpose is the seller would be willing to qualify it for a short period of time. And there may also be someone already on the team that could be incentivized to get the license.  And then I just did a short Google search just trying to do due diligence for the write up and like included a screenshot.  In order to get one of these, you either have to have a degree in like construction engineering, something like that, or have four years of experience working under a licensed contractor.  So Steve and Paul are gonna have either of those. So I think that may have concerned them. And I think they got scared off by that.  But yeah, that was that was Pauli's wording. And like, this was one of those licensing ones where it was so little of a concern.  Actually, I didn't even include it in the concerns section. I put it in the areas of clarification section. So that's kind of why I'm just putting it out there that maybe this is one that you want to push back on the right and say and then kind of verify if there really is a valid concern about that.  don't know.

11:45 - AcquiMatch Team
  I'm just bringing it up. That's something that I found a little bit simple. So I started the second one morning calling for those words that I might be addressing with everyone.  It's like do not be scared of the licensing thing.

12:00 - Luke Gillespie
  this. Yeah, I'm not.

12:02 - AcquiMatch Team
  That's paying someone like I never had that conversation with. So maybe they just said they're not sure. So look at that after this.

12:09 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah.

12:11 - AcquiMatch Team
  I'll just go.

12:13 - Luke Gillespie
  Okay. Yeah, yeah, because again, I also have mentioned that in the right of Oh, not having experience can be harder on SBA.  So I think they got scared by those two little things. But yeah, good point this, you might just want to question them a little bit about it.  But yeah, so that's that on that one.

12:30 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  When we're putting those points and like licensing or harder with SBA, we just reiterate, like, but this is something we can help you with.  It's not a challenge. It's not a deal breaker. It's something that we have experience to help you with, right?  Just something that's a good point. of like just a follow on like, we got you, we wouldn't be putting this in front of you.  We, you know, didn't think this is this was a, you know, situation that you can overcome and we can get through this.

12:58 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah, good point. Just don't make it see how it sound. Gary, and I know in my write-up, I mentioned both the experience and the licensing.  was like, this is not a deal breaker, just something to think about. I mentioned that. So, yeah.

13:08 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  it's good to point out, like absolutely want to address risk, but especially like you said, our jittery clients, or like anyone in general, right?  it's like, hey, this is a concern, but not one that we think is a deal breaker. And we have strategies for how you can overcome this.  So, like, you know, just be aware of this, but don't let this be the thing that discounts the deal for you.

13:33 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah.

13:34 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  we gotcha, kind of thing, just a reminder. Like, we gotcha, we wouldn't be put in this in front of you if we didn't think it was, you know, a situation you could address.  We have strategies. We'll talk you through.

13:44 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah.

13:45 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  you're right, because there are a lot of deals where the license is a deal breaker.

13:49 - Luke Gillespie
  then we obviously don't present the business to them.

13:51 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So, when we do present it, because the license is an ideal breaker. Yeah, good point.

13:55 - Luke Gillespie
  So, I'll leave this to Ryan to respond to them and talk to them about it.

13:59 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Nice.

14:00 - Luke Gillespie
  Okay, cool.

14:00 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  How's her other modeling offer on the fencing coming along?

14:06 - Luke Gillespie
  She said in that message that she just since pulling it back up, she said, we are continuing to work on the LOI for the fencing company.  So we'll proceed with finishing that, that's always she said. Ryan, I know I asked this every time I'm sorry.

14:20 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  I'm like, I only touch in two hours a week. So I don't keep these all head straight in my head.  What's the competition like on that one? Cause I really liked it, right?

14:28 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah. I don't think it sounds anything too crazy competitive. Broker's words from what he told me was, he's gotten a couple of LOIs, but they're not very attractive to him.  And yeah, why? No, he wouldn't tell me. Um, but this was, this broker based on everything told me about him.

14:47 - AcquiMatch Team
  It's just the most broke grade broker. They're like, don't like almost anything that I've heard about his guy. Uh, and then I also spoke with SP about him.  And I'm sorry. Okay, he's a sales man. He's just saying he's not he's not straight for a guy. He's just saying whatever you can to get some to the table.  And if I knocked out whatever they've got that made up, there's a lot of concerns with this business. This is the one I told you that I got on the call with them to like help them model it out.  And as I was digging things, I was like, this is a problem. This is a problem. This is problem.  I kind of told you I felt like I defeated them a little bit, but I told you that I started making jokes.  And I like, you know, they're taking this well. So Steve was like, well, what if I just make, he's like, I like this and this though.  I was like, I do like that. And he was like, well, what if I just make like a seller finance offer at these terms?  Well, that's a great idea. hope you put together another line and get a conversation started acknowledge the problems that they're trying to we're trying to sweep under the road.  Yeah, I'm not  people off. I'm not. They're good. So, yeah, do it. Put together an offer. So, he's been sending me some questions about how to model stuff.  I've been helping him with that. So they're progressive. They said, he said he wants to submit something because he likes the fence thing.  likes. Um, some of the things they've done. Um, he's just going to try to put the other offer that works for him.  So that's what we're all.

16:21 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay, great.

16:22 - AcquiMatch Team
  I don't think it's competitive enough that we're going to leave that office.

16:26 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay, cool. what were you going to say, Luke?

16:31 - Luke Gillespie
  No, I was just going to say, yeah, it's not one of those specially competitive ones like a CM deal.

16:35 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay, cool. Harry on.

16:37 - Luke Gillespie
  Okay. Yes. And then so today I've spent mostly all day chasing off market leads, sending a lot of calls and emails and texts because we weren't getting as many leads.  So I have one call scheduled for Ryan next week. Maybe it's going to be a fit. could be a good one for Andrew.  guy, he's in Salt Lake City right now, but he runs this business from his laptop. It's kind of like a roofing contracting business.  and he's telling me they they they do like big contract projects so they range from doing four to eight million dollars in revenue he wasn't comfortable telling me his sde and i was like okay no problem and so i explained him the process and said well you me with ryan and so and i told him we'll do it again everything and so he's he has a call scheduled with ryan next week so hopefully that that could be a good lead we'll see how that goes just a clarification when you when you're speaking to them about sde you're not using that phrase right no no because most of them don't know what sde is okay i know we put you on the front lines i know a lot of training with you but i'm like okay cool yeah yeah no the way i normally phrase the question is first i asked everyone like oh just rough estimate off the top of your head would you be willing to tell me how much you guys do on annual revenue and then they tell me and then the way i phrase the question and then the way they respond you can tell if they know the difference from their tax return number and their actual sde say oh and how much would you say like net income at the bottom line is

18:00 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  coming into your pocket every year and then they kind of either give some vague number or they start they understand the concept of adbacks and trying to uh depreciate uh you know take uh deductions on their taxes and things like that so yeah no i'm not asking them what's your SD yeah okay um follow on question and i like to ask is like that might open the door a little bit more for a conversation is like when you ask what the revenue is would be like oh cool and like were you profitable and you know yes or no and like um what would you say like you know are i'd probably ask something around margins or you know something like that like you know what would you like do you have an idea like what your profit margins are or anything like that um because the amount to your pocket is unbelievably something that they don't understand even still it's really hard to like determine that yeah you know because like  If look at a keynote, it doesn't necessarily take owner distributions into account and then also an owner might be on a salary and also taking distributions for a support and health insurance and that sort of thing.  So really, we don't need to know much more than like, are you revenues, Holly? What are your emergence kind of like, as a big consistent over the last couple years been trading, like COVID was rough.  know, like, have you been growing?

19:31 - Luke Gillespie
  Have you been fluctuating? What's that been looking like? Like, have you been profitable the last three years?

19:36 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Are you growing the last three years? So just more softer questions kind of like that will give you an idea of like, are they volatile and open to selling because they're like in trouble now?  Like, that sales have been declining or sales steady, you know, decent margins and profitable. So like, it's too early to kind of get too  far into the numbers, but we just need to know, like, are you profitable, right? So, might clam up on giving you specifics pre-NDA, but there's other ways to ask it, you know, and it's like, Hey, I don't know if you'll know this off your top of your head, but like, you know, what would you say your margins are like, You know, and then just it's an open door question for them to kind of talk about little bit.

20:21 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah, that's a good point Thanks for the tips. Yeah, instead of just going straight into the intimate questions kind of water.

20:28 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, like what's going in your pocket You and also bear in mind that even though it is totally legal to do all of these tax advantage things that like the tax goat, the tax coach I just taught you and that we do and that sort of thing, it's still feels just because of the culture that we have that it's like, That it's not okay to do everything that the tax code tells you that you can do.  So they might clam up little bit to like, before they know us very well and know that they can trust us because like  You know, it like, you know, money to your pocket or how much are you saving on taxes and that sort of thing.  they'll be like, are you auditing me here? you for the IRS? Like, we're going to tell.

21:11 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah, you're right. Good point. That's why it's the most important thing in these off market calls is always kind of building rapport and establishing that I'm a real person and getting them to like me because they just, these owners get so many spend calls from people trying to buy.

21:23 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah. And be like, I know this is like, and I think I've told you both this, but I always make a little joke.  I'm like, thanks for being brave enough to talk to a stranger from the internet, know. And they're like, huh?  And they're like, you know, so I know this is weird. Whatever you're not comfortable answering at this point, totally okay.  Just need to get a sense of, you know, if it's worth your time to keep talking to us because I have amazing buyers that are individuals that live in your communities that would make great business owners that are looking for amazing businesses like yourself, you know.  And so then that you give them permission. Like if they're like upfront, like, hey, I know this is weird.  And I'm going to ask you some questions just to make sure like I'm not wasting your time also here's what's in it for you, you know, it's like these amazing people that aren't investors like we only represent individuals.  There's no feed to you like, but I need to ask you a few questions, and then, like sometimes if I feel like they're climbing up a little bit, I'll be like, and, you know, today we'll just get a rough sense of, of, you know, if it feels like it's worth a, you know, mutually if we feel like it's worth another conversation.  And before we get to into the weeds on everything, we're gonna, have a confidentiality agreement so you know that we're not going to tell anyone what's going on.

22:38 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah.

22:40 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  And then, like, and I've also said before the numbers, like, I'm not, like, I know that this is kind of probably more at the Ryan stage when we start getting to the ad back.  Okay. We know that business owners just have a lot of, you know, tools in the toolkits to reduce their taxes so we're not checking on you.  All it's like this is to your benefit for us to understand but early in the conversation they might not trust us enough trust us enough for us to get like that in the leads.

23:08 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah. Yeah. Those are all good things and I generally do all of those things like I use their concerns like I know you get all these spam calls you know I have a real person I've been out of connecting with all of them on LinkedIn I say my phone names Luke Gillespie I just added you on LinkedIn you can see me there and I yeah I bring up the NDA's like oh I if they kind of get stiff stiff about the numbers I'm like oh I don't want you to say anything you don't want to say just just know that if we go forward with this we would sign NDA legally binding us to protect your information and yeah and then when they talk about because sometimes when I ask them about their you know what's going on in their pocket they're like oh my taxes I take a huge loss and I'm like oh I know I do the same with my LLC and they're like oh you know or you know right yeah okay so you know all the things I'm just giving you some other like what might be in their head or they might not know what's going into their pocket because it's just there's so many  tax advantage ways to like move money and hide it and not get

24:00 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, tax on it. You know, and it's like for S-corps, you have to do payroll and distribution in that, you know, so Learning that right now.

24:10 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah, yeah.

24:10 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, exactly. Like I don't even know how much I get, you know, Yeah, exactly.

24:19 - Luke Gillespie
  You have to like pay money to avoid taxes.

24:21 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  like you have to pay taxes to pay taxes like, oh, yeah I know it'll be interesting to see what Trump um Does Like sounds like he's just in there I need to look into it.

24:35 - Luke Gillespie
  Have y'all heard I've just heard whispers about Elon going in and like auditing the government He's just like doing what he did at twitter and just going in and like  save all the inefficiencies and lost money is Yeah, they're going crazy.  It's beautiful and that's cool.

24:50 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  All right. mean like Trump can't reelected So it was like if I was a businessman running the country, what would I do?  Like it's a turnaround. It's literally a turnaround

25:00 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah, yeah, it's, it's interesting.

25:04 - AcquiMatch Team
  What, what they want to talk about conversation, well, since we're talking about it is, is whatever they do say on those callers, Luke.  Yes, mainly just listening and trying to get them to the next case, wouldn't get that. So, like, for instance, let's say they say they're doing a million dollars in revenue and they say, and I'm really looking, know, for $10 million, that's what I'm looking for.  Okay. And just put it as a note for me. Yeah, we don't, if we don't, at that stage, we don't need to tell them, oh, well, your business works, right?

25:47 - Luke Gillespie
  exactly.

25:48 - AcquiMatch Team
  That's it. I'm like, okay, you're doing $2 million, we're doing $1 million in revenue, do you know what your business might be?  Most of time they're not going to get the whole media, or they're not to the cost. So it doesn't have to make sure 50% 10% blah, blah, right?  That's like, oh, well, gosh, that's I mean. And then something like that, right? So I'm just like, any time you get stuck, or, well, let me get me full of my P&Ls.  Doesn't, I go get, doesn't have to be exact, just sit like a $10 revenue, $5, $10, $1 revenue. So I did, there's like 1.5 on my plastic.  So it's like, that's fine, right? So it's just about making the clock. Oh, see, getting some general information, and then making them feel positive about the next row.  And then on that next call, so learn about that and make them feel excited and then bring them back down but for about what evaluation might be.  Otherwise, it's important to do on the second call instead of trying to get on the first call today. You want to make them feel, if you even know what we're talking about, we're asking by questions and they're, if you have the right questions, these guys know what the .

26:56 - Luke Gillespie
  And then when I say evaluations really gets in between three and five.

27:00 - AcquiMatch Team
  Yeah, even if they wanted 10, now they realize that's not, that's not the one that's sick because they spoke to me and they realized that they're out of their debt.  Yeah. they'll go away and they'll come back to us when they, when they realize, I don't know why I said something dollars, I just made that.

27:16 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah, right.

27:17 - AcquiMatch Team
  So just making easy for making it off the pressure and don't get exact numbers, part numbers, not your head.  Okay, sounds Don't go from that off perfectly.

27:27 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah, that's good advice. Yeah. Yeah. And I, I do that. Yeah, I never bring up pricing with them at all.  And yeah, they always never pressure them. Like, just give me a rough estimate off the top of your head, you know, and yeah, I'm always, and I'm always trying to make things work.  I'm generally just vetting out the deal breakers and then passing them on to you. You know, like, if they tell me they're just not profitable at all, or like they had a $300,000 loss last year, then it's like, Oh, okay, that's probably not going to worry here.

27:54 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  I'm just making sure like if it's in Utah, okay, can Andrew operate it remotely?

27:59 - Luke Gillespie
  So yeah, yeah. I'm trying to think back on anything else as of right now. I have a gas station for Jason that I want to do right up for.  I'm just working trying to get some more shine some more light on the financials because these gas brake station brokers are kind of just not the usual ones that you work with.  They even send me a second gas station in the same city.

28:25 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So I'm going to take a look at that as well. And then yeah sorry Jason's in the gas station.

28:32 - Luke Gillespie
  He is. We submitted him one before and he said he would be interested but he wants it to include the real estate that one didn't include the real estate.  He said I have friends who own gas station. They said you have to own the property because my concern is the landlord can just keep raising the rent.  So we said no taking Jason. We won't submit you another gas station unless it includes the real estate and both of these gas stations I'm looking at include the real estate.  So most likely we'll qualify for 25 year and more with the 7 a loan and it'll be canceling you know an absent.  T like 50k a year for Jason something like that. So yeah, that's kind of what we're looking at for him.  And then yeah, update more update for you on that recalibration recalibration for Gil's search Onka talk to the deal team.  They are implementing it and but it might take just a day or two more to kind of fully start scraping the internet.

29:23 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So that's that on GL and then I'm going to really put a lot of effort into A H today.  Sorry, sorry. It gave me a favor and pause after every client, right?

29:32 - Luke Gillespie
  Sorry, sorry.

29:33 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  listen to X podcast all the time.

29:35 - Luke Gillespie
  talk too fast.

29:36 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Sometimes you guys know right Ryan did it too. It's like get all the updates out.

29:40 - Luke Gillespie
  It's like pause after a client. Sorry. What was the recalibration on Gil's? Well, we spoke about that. spoke about that on Tuesday.  Remember he told Ryan, oh, I feel like the perfect company for me would be an IT consulting business where I can run it from.

29:53 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay, okay, okay. What happened with the pet one?

29:57 - Luke Gillespie
  I just spoke to the broker today after chasing him for a week straight. It's not going to qualify. It's er, I know that it's not going to qualify for SB, but they don't want to use SBA.  The seller doesn't want SBA, but he's willing to do a large amount of seller financing, like 50%, but Gil still doesn't have enough liquid cash for the equity injection.

30:15 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  It's wild that owners these days would not like, or that brokers are even telling owners that going to be  possible.  I know.

30:30 - Luke Gillespie
  How did we leave that one or how are we going to leave it? Yeah, I know. asked the broker and I was like, oh, really?  why not? He's like, he doesn't want to deal with the trouble. You know, he's a lawyer in Queens. And I was like, okay, well, yeah, my guy, he was looking to utilize SBA and then the brokers trying to ask me, oh, much does he have for a cash injection?  And I was like, well, he would have enough for the 10% SBA loan, but if it's not going to qualify for SBA, I think that that might be a deal breaker for us.  What do you think? he's like, yeah, that's probably not going to work, but yeah. But the broker was nice.  He said, yeah, I mean, it's He likes us and what we did, he said, yeah, looking forward to working with you on future opportunities, but it's just, yeah, he doesn't want to use SPA.  Maybe this one's a bit of a unique one because it's a pet grooming shop and they have 11 locations.  This guy originally was acquiring all these different pet shops individually and doing a roll-up strategy for wanting to private equity.
  ACTION ITEM: Email broker re pet grooming shop. Push back on SBA concerns. Highlight buyer profile, AcquiMatch expertise. Suggest seller meeting. Schedule 2-week follow-up. - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/231990886?timestamp=1872.9999  So maybe he's looking for a strategic buyer or something like that.

31:23 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Well, I would go back. would follow up with the broker and just be like, hey, me and the team all loved this for this client.  And, you know, he, you can even use the line about like being a part of putting joy in people's lives.  yeah, but I would just be like, you know, team and I all loved this. We were really excited to introduce it to him.  The SBA thing will be a deal breaker unless the sellers open a significantly more finance. But if you guys don't find the strategic, like, please come back to us or what you might even  been able to do to take more action. This is a sales thing, right? Like, you never let them go without scheduling the next call.  So I would go back to him and just say like, hey, when do you think the seller might, like, how long before the seller might be open to other alternatives?  And I can check in to see if nobody else is in place. Or how about I check in in two weeks?  And if you all haven't gotten any offers, maybe we can talk strategy about how to do this. Just that's three different opportunities.  But you don't just want to be like, okay, thanks, know, it's like the seller's being unrealistic, potentially. Like if P has not swooped in yet, then they might not.
  ACTION ITEM: Create HubSpot task. 2-week reminder. Check pet grooming shop deal status. Re-engage if no progress. - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/231990886?timestamp=1960.9999  So the seller wanting an all cash buyer, that's what he wants. But as time goes on, and if he doesn't even really wants to sell, and that's not coming through, then he might change his tune.  So we just want to make sure, keep on your radar, send a task for yourself and HubSpot to remind yourself in two weeks to go and check it, like on deals where you're like, I really liked this one.  Well, yeah, and it's just the seller digging their heels in or whatever, then then you want to make sure you're checking back on them in a timely manner and like, because they're they might change.  So it doesn't so much work up to these point. You don't want to lose these opportunities. That's a good point.

33:17 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah. And normally normally I do that. Yeah, I'll send an email to him after this call and then ask him, Hey, the seller changes the money, you guys are looking for SBA and my buyer would love it.  And yeah, this guy, he's running the business from his laptop. He, uh, he's literally a lawyer and Queens. He's, he's not, you know, focusing all his time on the business rights.  So He's in the buyer profile.

33:38 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  No, I, I would, I would just do a follow up and be like, Hey, we love this for our because he wants to put joy in people's lives and feels like a really great skillset.  Here's his profile in case you want to put it in front of the seller. If he changes his mind about being a bit individual buyers, our buyers are different because they're actually going to look after the business.  They want to be business owners. So it's not, you know, like understand, he's not a strategic, but yeah, yeah, like if, if anything changes, let me know, I'm going to check in with you in two weeks just to see if you haven't had that strategic fire come along, maybe, maybe we can have another chat.

34:15 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah, good idea. I would do that. Thank you.

34:19 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  And then think about how you're doing that for all the other ones like that, you know, like maybe you guys need to make an extra stage in the pipeline where it's like, great deal.  Unrealistic expectations or something, right, where it's like, then when deal flows, so you go back, I did this for sales, like, you I look at anybody that wasn't closed because it was like lost, right.  And if it's been more than 30 days and like, how do I reengage them?

34:47 - Luke Gillespie
  How do I get in touch with them, you know. Yeah, that's a good idea. And I do normally do that.  test myself where I always end things. Okay, well, things change always reach back out to me. And I do, I will test myself on Hubs about weeks later.  I think this one I maybe just did. And just because he was one of those New Yorker guys the way he was talking and he was kind of rushing to end the phone call once he wasn't going to be a fan.  So I was like, all right, all right, yeah, nice to meet you. We'll work together in the future. So yeah, I'll email him for sure.

35:12 - AcquiMatch Team
  I would say like, almost like sell them right now, but there's New York sales guys when they're like, well, it's not nice, it's nice, it's not sell.

35:31 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah.

35:31 - AcquiMatch Team
  And these guys, who knows, maybe that guy's driving just doesn't feel like I have a call phone call, he representing the seller correctly.

35:39 - Luke Gillespie
  Right.

35:40 - AcquiMatch Team
  So that's, and so the idea of like, Hey, why don't you have to buy our profile in front of it?  You can let him decide right if the broker is like, we're gonna want to sell by one of the things that we are going to find, see, we're selling, right.  So, yeah, I get an example. So we had our deal that was for CM. Um, they were really gatekeeping this deal.  were trying to select a certain amount of candidates that we're going to have a pile of them. And, um, I just kept pushing like, that's us.  We can make it, that's, uh, we can put it, but we have to write by it. We can make that, right?

36:16 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah.

36:17 - AcquiMatch Team
  And I just got pushing. It's like, we can do a product bar and you can sell it to a And then it was like, you probably can do one more call, right?  And I was we'll, we'll take out with Chris and say, Hey, we'll do this call a little while you have to do tomorrow.

36:33 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah.

36:34 - AcquiMatch Team
  And, um, later on, at a call of Chris, he said, Oh, you know that, well, it didn't work out and I'm not working out with it.  But Chris then talked to me, Hey, you know that business, a friend of mine tried to also set up a call of seller to make a client.

36:56 - Luke Gillespie
  And so he said, I see you guys are doing your job. Yeah.

37:00 - AcquiMatch Team
  He's like, I probably wouldn't have gotten that close.

37:04 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Get those quotes.

37:07 - AcquiMatch Team
  So that's that's part of the thing. We're doing, we're getting them to we can't we can't we can't a horse a lot.  right, but that's it. We just got to get them to that stage. Yeah. So some of these brokers, that's just the way they are.  We just have to over the kind of sell ourselves and that we're the right buyer. So we can do the best part on get them.  In front of, because they're, they're trying to, yeah, we don't, we don't, we don't, we don't want to a person that's talking about.

37:35 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, lay into them too. It's like, oh man, like, I like, why does your seller not want to do SBA?  You know, like I dig into that. Oh, like people fall apart and be like, well, our buyers have us alongside them.  And we get people close, right? we make this process a lot easier. We work with amazing lenders who like love our process and our clients.  It's like, this guy is going to be awesome for this business. I think I think you, like, should put this in front of your client, like, let, like, like Brian said, him decide, you know?

38:11 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah.

38:12 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Because it's like, if it's just the SBA thing, everything else feels good. And like, we can revisit the financing later, but maybe we should get them together and see if he likes him.

38:21 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah. Yeah, that's good.

38:23 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  broker probably knows how reasonable he's being not not wanting to be open to SBA. So, yeah, like, I don't take no for an answer.  Like, in sales, it's a little bit harder because it's like, it's my baby, but like, it's, you're not like people aren't projecting use, you know what I mean?  It's not like, you're not asking for money, you're not asking for anything. So I have a lot easier of a time pushing people and being like, and just troubleshooting, right?  being friendly about it, like, well, hey, I totally get why he's not cool with SBA. like, I I think you might be missing something here because our guy is awesome.  Right in the same neighborhood, like we helped him through the SBA process. So it's not as painful. Like, what do you think about us just getting them together?  know, like maybe you should talk to them or why don't you look at his profile? Like, um, because then it's really hard when you're coming up with solutions and people have to keep, you know, they have to play defense.

39:25 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah, exactly.

39:27 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So you're kind of taking the control back by being friendly, but also suggesting, well, I get that, but like, I think, you know, hey, what about this?  And like, you know, he's going to be waiting potentially a long time. If you guys haven't gotten orders already, I'll cash and like, I know that SBA process is painful, but like we work with amazing lenders and we help people through the process.

39:49 - Luke Gillespie
  So it's not like he's going to be at this alone. Yeah. Yeah.

39:54 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  If we don't even work with people, we don't think we can get them financed. We get them pre-qualified to make sure we can get them financed before we even work with them.

40:00 - Luke Gillespie
  No, so from the financing side, like he's good. Yeah.

40:07 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, sometimes brokers like the older ones, especially they don't do that many deals and they're operating off SOPs from like a couple years ago, you know, like they're not even up to date with SBA now, how it works, like that there's so many lenders and it's been like optimized and that sort of thing.  So sometimes the brokers need some education too. But yeah, if if you like it, like, I just keep keep at it in a friendly way, looking for solutions, like trying to overcome it, you know?

40:43 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah. Okay. Yeah, I'll push more on him.

40:48 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, or even like putting it to him, like, Hey, you're the expert here, like, I think this would be a great match.  We have this little issue of the finance, you know, financing method, it's not like the finance again.

41:00 - Luke Gillespie
  can't be done.

41:02 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  But the method, like, what do you think we should do here?

41:08 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah. Okay.

41:12 - AcquiMatch Team
  That's the mentality that I like is one of your say put them on defense, just keep doing like that.  questions will always be different for everybody, just keep thinking, just keep putting them on that. So that's not good enough.  All right, let's do it. That's what we'll get.

41:30 - Luke Gillespie
  Okay.

41:32 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Friendly persistence, you know, not taking no for an answer. So it's like, like, we've all been on the receiving end of like an aggressive, like horrible person that's just not reading between the lines.  But he didn't outright give you a nose like, man, I'd love to work with you and work with you on another deal.  So he's probably in a tough place with his client, he's not being reasonable. Do you have a problem solved with him and be like, Hey, I realize your client might be operating off some like different thoughts of how SBA.  works like we you know like for all the things I've already said you know so I don't know I like if I love a deal for someone like I would keep checking in like any buyer's got you know like have you gone thunder off or you know like just like um even the NDA thing like I wouldn't I mean I know you guys are doing it a lot more now because of volume but I wouldn't I wouldn't let client sign NDAs before I got the deals because I would just keep problems coming with them or like you know like hey you know like this is what we do this is how we work I want to work with you long term this isn't gonna work in this way like what do you need for me to trust me to be able to review a deal and give you my word that I will not be showing my client anything you know um because it's like  I can bring you off market deals I'm going to bring you  multiple clients, like I'm also saving you the headache of tire kickers and being able to vet it. But it's not going to work if I have to get my clients signing hundreds of NDAs, you know, yeah.  So like that was like literally, I tried absolutely everything and I ran out of ideas. I ran out of ways like I ran out of offense.

43:22 - Luke Gillespie
  Uh huh.

43:28 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Anyways, that was, that was, that was the Ryan and Athena like strategy training you weren't expecting.

43:37 - Luke Gillespie
  No, I love it. Thank you guys. Seriously. I learned a lot from you guys and you make me better.  And I realized where I went wrong and how I can improve. And yeah, I was just learning. an apply knowledge so quickly it's phenomenal.  Thanks.

43:55 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So it's easy to pour into you because it's not at a loss.

43:58 - Luke Gillespie
  We know you're going to take it and run with it. know, it's Awesome to see that. Yeah, thanks for teaching me the loan structuring less on Tuesday as well I included that on the right up and I explained it to SP so.

44:08 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, new level unlocked. Real estate ahead . Yeah, awesome.

44:16 - Luke Gillespie
  I love learning from you guys.

44:18 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  It's awesome.

44:19 - Luke Gillespie
  And my internship that I did in Malaysia this last summer, I was working under the guy who was basically the head of the Malaysian operation for the business and every time and we were also working with the leader in the UK.  So I would be working with both of them and they were just such senior business guys every meeting with them.  They would just like drop these knowledge bombs.

44:40 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  would just learn so much from them. I loved it and that's like how I feel meetings with you guys when you teach me.  I love it. It's awesome. That's nice to hear. We'll keep dropping the knowledge because I don't think there's anything more rewarding as I got meant for a manager to see people take you know advice and  run with it, like to apply the knowledge, right? And you probably have friends that you, they have a problem and they keep coming to you with problem and you tell them what to do about it.  Like they don't do the thing. So it's like, it's highly rewarding when you're like, okay, I give a little piece of advice or I give a bit of training and somebody takes that and runs with it or applies it or has a good result.  It's addicting to see people develop and grow. At least for me and probably, like Ryan's so good at training.  imagine you enjoy that too to see people like becoming better versions, know, unlocking challenges and achieving things.

45:44 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah, I know what you mean. A lot of people would reach out to me for tips on how to get internships.

45:51 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  You did five. That's amazing. I love that.

45:56 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah, I tell them, I show all my friends. There's an AI. I that will like apply to jobs automatically for you and that can just get you to apply to so many jobs.  I didn't use it for this job. Don't worry.

46:08 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  I couldn't have done it on your website. It's only when it's on like, yeah, the deep peak on the, on the webinar was exceptional.

46:14 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah. was using the unreleased deep-seek model from China.

46:21 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah. Yeah. have somebody else on the webinar asking questions with your face on, know? Yeah.

46:31 - Luke Gillespie
  Okay.

46:32 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  My, um, any other major updates on your site, Luke, I have just a few follow up questions on clients.

46:42 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah, I know. have nothing to say.

46:44 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay. Have we heard from J.J.?

46:48 - Luke Gillespie
  Nope.

46:55 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  concerning, is it not?

46:56 - AcquiMatch Team
  That's where.

46:59 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Well, that's where. Okay, um, and then, uh, have you heard from her? Is she okay?

47:21 - Luke Gillespie
  Jenny, last time we heard from her was February 3rd.

47:34 - AcquiMatch Team
  I think we're going to stop at this SMS. Would you say Ryan? I keep getting messed up. Where is she responding?  Sometimes at the SMS.

47:45 - Luke Gillespie
  it's a. Yeah. I see here Ryan. She responded to she responded Monday at 8 20. Yeah, this Monday. She responded that she's going to urgent care and won't be able to make the meeting.

47:55 - AcquiMatch Team
  Okay. need to respond. Just make sure she's okay. So.

48:02 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Is it worth sending an S.O.S. Jenny? Like, hey, Jenny, heard from you in 10 days. Is everything okay?

48:11 - Luke Gillespie
  Ryan did that yesterday.

48:13 - AcquiMatch Team
  Oh, did. Yeah.

48:16 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay, and still nothing.

48:18 - AcquiMatch Team
  Yeah, nothing.

48:21 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Have we a semester?

48:24 - Luke Gillespie
  No, I mean, it's she she checks like she's just thinking.

48:33 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Sorry, your headphones. It's kind of hard to hear you.

48:36 - AcquiMatch Team
  Yeah, she's intentionally not. She's, I never problem with her. So it's the first time.

48:47 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay, cool. Any other major updates things I should be concerned or aware of.

48:56 - AcquiMatch Team
  So the only two updates for me since last time we spoke is. it's very interesting. JB is at a settler meeting yesterday with the initial deal he really liked and he said it went well so he's going to actually have another in-person meeting with them next week.

49:15 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay.

49:16 - AcquiMatch Team
  now he has two businesses that he's had two, right? He's got a signed online, he's this other one which we were ready to submit a seller's pulled out.  So now they're ripped their back. So that's cool. And then Jason as well. We worked on, he said me some questions on modeling and we updated modeling.  think he's going to put together an hello-eye on this office suite business that Luke found for him and so he might be spending an hello-eye for a office suite business this week.

49:43 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Did that one knock or what happened to that one?

49:46 - AcquiMatch Team
  No, the broker ghosted him for a while and then we got more aggressive. If we like made a plan to get a little more aggressive with the broker and then the broker started responding and then he did a site visit.  It went well and now we've got data financials, and now he's going to submit an offer.

50:04 - Luke Gillespie
  Nice. OK, I saw in the slide, and it was funny, Jason said, oh, the broker responds a lot quicker when I see the owners on the email as well.

50:18 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Jason's cheeky.

50:19 - Luke Gillespie
  I like him. Yeah, he keeps us on our toes.

50:22 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  But that's good. We need that. You know, it's good. OK, I was going to ask about the Tampa lawyers, and there was something else that just crossed my mind, which, oh, did you check in with the sellers on the CM off market?
  ACTION ITEM: Contact Kevin. Inquire SMB Lawyer cell-side capabilities. If not, request Tampa lawyer referrals for Joe's deal. - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/231990886?timestamp=3037.9999  Are they still they still live?

50:43 - AcquiMatch Team
  No, not today, but I'm fully confident that.

50:48 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  OK, awesome. And then in terms of lawyers in Tampa, did you need me to check in with the SMB logger because they're actually going to be at the event going to later?  So they have a part. Aaron Dallas, but like Sam Rosati and Eric, I think his name is the two other partners live in Tampa.

51:07 - AcquiMatch Team
  Yeah, I think it's worth it because I told Joe to schedule weekly calls with Pino, the seller, and that he should bring up on that call again, the lawyers, because I explain that this can cause an issue, right?  So you might as well try to get ahead of it, see if you can see if he's open to it, and then be like, Ryan can make the referral for you, or someone to represent who can be good at this deal, and I kind of told him how to phrase it, he's like, okay, and then you brought it up again on the call, and so I think now it's in Joe's mind, he should do that.  So yeah, if we were as ready as possible, I do want Joe to make that a recommend date. I want Joe to say that to Pino on his call.

51:52 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay, I'm going to talk to Kevin then and say, do you all do cell size? If not, do you guys have anyone you like in Tampa?  because we feel like this owner is going to prefer someone local rather than a digital law firm imagining. Yeah, okay, cool.  Great. I'll bring that up with him tonight. Cool. Sounds good. Anything else?

52:23 - Luke Gillespie
  Nope.

52:24 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Nice. right. We get to finish five minutes early.

52:27 - Luke Gillespie

  He was Chinese. Here's Chinese Venezuelan.

54:54 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Oh, okay. Um, yeah, they just, they couldn't afford us. And so I think they did the first thing. He he negotiated really hard on like cancellation and like didn't even do that He's like I'm not seeing the value here And I was like you're not even engaging on the deals that we're sending you what do you mean like he wasn't reading?  Oh, I remember yeah Ryan was doing these write-ups. He wasn't even reading them like it was mild, but it's crazy.

55:16 - AcquiMatch Team
  I was like He's a weird guy Yeah, was Worked out that way though because they would have been really tough to work with so I mean it was a gut punch because I like to think that Everybody's ridiculously happy and never wants to refund but actually they weren't a good fit for us.  So My weird feeling on him was that he was trying to be someone he's not But he was trying to play this role just like I have money and I have experience and I know this and I know that You  And like he was like trying to play game almost review to be like I'm I'm important and I was like, I was like, I'm not doing any of the things we ask you to do.  I don't really seem like you're serious about buying a business was weird thing.

56:17 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)

56:23 - AcquiMatch Team
