  Hey. How's it going?

0:06 - Luke Gillespie
  Good. How are you?

0:08 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Good. Yeah. Outside and walked in the sunshine for 45 minutes at lunch.

0:15 - Luke Gillespie
  was amazing. Oh, great. Today?

0:18 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah.

0:19 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah.

0:19 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  told you guys my goal this week was to get back into like a sustainable group. So part of that is like getting up from the desk and going outside for a moment.

0:30 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah. I like to do that too. Take walking breaks to stress the legs.

0:36 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  There. I mean, it's incredible what that and there's tons of research that backs like how reviving it can be.  How good it is for creativity. my recovery score on my, do you know what loop is?

0:51 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah, we talk about loop.

0:54 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, recovery score. It's like your recovery is 8% higher every day after you go outside for more than 30 minutes.  I mean, we're not meant to be inside, so I did a desk, so hey, David.

1:07 - David R
  Yeah, we were just talking about, I took a walk outside as part of my goal to get myself back into a sustainable working schedule, I took a walk at lunch and it was amazing.

1:20 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah, that's great.

1:21 - David R
  I always do it, you know, I walk my dog out every three days, three times per day, sorry. So in the morning after lunch and then at night, it's really refrigeration, you know, like go out and just 20 minutes a walk and then go back and you can just deep work.

1:41 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  That is one of the, like, I mean, obviously having a cute old pet around is a great advantage, but like forcing you to go outside multiple times a day.  Yeah, that's cool. Nice, welcome. Happy start of a new month, start of the week. speak. How are we feeling about things?

2:04 - AcquiMatch Team
  Good.

2:06 - Luke Gillespie
  So I thought the call went well, I completely forgot to try to have a like, I think it's good to have a follow on conversation when someone like Nash is on.  But Oh, yeah. Yeah, I've been named driving Nash and my little video watchers.

2:23 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  I know it's good. seating on back to our content to watch it because it's to their benefit to learn that stuff.

2:29 - Luke Gillespie
  So I actually do that in a lot of my looms. Yeah, I'd be like, Oh, virus club, we talked about this.  Yeah. And it's always relevant. That's why the virus thumbs are so good.

2:39 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, well, may they continue to be as long as I can keep finding content, things. Thank you for your help getting prepped and getting my mind wrapped around the rat.  Oh, something that came up just super briefly. But like said, sounded like we're not getting a ton of deal flow for justice.

4:00 - David R
  Yeah, so we have a bunch of more deals in that for JG, I just have to push them to verify.  I need to work faster, I think, to push them faster and try to give as fast as possible the deals and the seams.  But yeah, we have a good amount for JG particularly. Some of them are, for me, are kind of good deals, construction, manufacturing.  I think we have something there. For the rest of the clients, will say DL is kind of low deal flow.  So I'm trying to do like a hunting for them, trying to find more deals in some other places, some look like they, there was a client that is called K, like that, like it was called client and they have like,  the same similar area with JG. So what we did with Anka was to pull those leads that we had from Amazon and then push them into Mail Check for JG.  So we're going to probably see something there with those deals. But yeah, this is what we have so far.

5:20 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Nice. So something about the Austin market in particular for you guys to be aware of is I'd say it's the most competitive researcher market in the whole of the US.  So like whatever you think is fast, be faster. In order for us to like get our clients an advantage, we have to move those Austin specific deals, especially the good ones, like super fast.  Otherwise, you know, there's so many people that are searching here that have good experience that are well capitalized because they're former  tech folks, they're searching full-time, they don't want to leave Austin, which is why I tell people I only take one Austin client at a time, because it was really hard with LK.  I think Justin's open to San Antonio if I'm not mistaken, which helps things.

6:20 - Luke Gillespie
  A little bit, yeah, but he prefers Austin.

6:23 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, so, but you know, we ended up finding LK's deal in San Antonio, which they are phasing to be remote over time, and Kevin's only there three days a week.  So, that being said, you know, we want to move fast with all of our clients in the competitive markets, but I just know Austin in particular, we're going to have a hard time.  So, the faster we can jump on deals and move them forward, because we also have that timeline where they're not engaging with the brokers, we are, right?  Okay, so we want to make sure we're not losing them the deal because we're taking our time getting a right up over to them and then by the time they get the right up, then there's already yellow eyes on it that they're accepting and that sort of thing so um.  There were. I'm wondering Ryan likes something that we're talking about you and me and on cut. I know most of the brokers in Austin like I go to the local meetups here.  Um, I wonder if it's worth doing like because you guys said the email rebranding email got a bunch of free sims so I wonder if it's like now that we have a plant in Austin again like sending an email to all of our Austin brokers and like hey.  New amazing qualified buyer in Austin like he got anything. and it could go out from me, but then you guys pick up the emails or the responses or something.  Maybe that's something that we could try.

8:08 - AcquiMatch Team
  I think we should definitely try that. It's a good idea.

8:12 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Cool. I love that you guys pulled the off market from LK. There was a roofing business that seemed like a really solid roofing business.  I don't know what ended up happening with him. I think he had like potential like private equity offers, but he got further down the track in conversations with me.  It might be worth re-engaging with him if roofing is a industry that JG is interested in because it seemed like a solid business.

8:45 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah, he's done for roofers.

8:49 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Great. So go back through the pipeline also, not just the leads. Did you guys go through the pipeline for LK for the off-market?

9:00 - AcquiMatch Team
  that Edo was supposed to be working on, so.

9:02 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  What would you say?

9:03 - AcquiMatch Team
  That's what Edo was supposed to be working on today.

9:06 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  OK, cool. Yeah, go back. So a few of them got a little bit further down the track. So I'd look at all the conversations that we had for LK for off-market.  They only ran their off-market for a month because they were on a package that was on-market only. Which made things even harder for us, which is why we changed that people must do on an off-market.  But even the off-market conversations in Austin, those owners will have been hit up six ways from Sunday. So.

9:40 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah, yeah. And we were going to look back at Chris's past deal as well for JG.

9:49 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Great. OK, cool.

9:51 - Luke Gillespie
  then given that Austin is so competitive, is it likely that we're still going to just push deals to JG, even if it's his first one for one, that's like, oh.  We already have an L.O.I. or something like that. Like kind of the DL plumbing one, you know, if it's something like that happens, are we trying to avoid that or is Austin is so competitive that we have to accept that.

10:11 - AcquiMatch Team
  That's going to happen.

10:13 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  I think we want to go ahead, Ryan.

10:16 - AcquiMatch Team
  I was just going to say, I think what we need to do is set an expectation with the broker, like, know, ask like, hey, how close is the deal?  How close are these L.O.I.s? Is there a do that?

10:27 - Luke Gillespie
  You're going to stop accepting L.O.I.s?

10:29 - AcquiMatch Team
  I'd like to introduce a potential buyer, but at same time, know, have enough time to review the business and make a decision, you know, just get their confirmation on that.  And then, and then depending on his responses, you can present the business and just let them know in the next step section, this is where we are in the steel.

10:51 - Luke Gillespie
  Oh, yeah. That's what I would.

10:52 - AcquiMatch Team
  So, so given that it's a competitive market, it's probably a good thing to write up right in the beginning and just kind of bring it around.  to JG that, hey, this is a competitive market and a lot of these businesses are going to have interested parties.  It's going to be important to move quick. That being said, this is the first one and it's a bit competitive when we want to get in front of you.  And if after discussing that with the broker, if you feel it's still like, if you feel like maybe we submitted and it goes under all people in, you have any questions about that, you can run about it.  But I say, if you found something already, let's get in front of them before instead of waiting.

11:34 - Luke Gillespie
  Okay.

11:36 - AcquiMatch Team
  What do you think?

11:40 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, I like we should put something in front of some and we know they're not going to have a chance at, you know, so like if there's if there's offers, like, it's always one of those like having a conversation with a broker like, okay, you've got a bunch of offers, like, are you making decision?  Is there time for another person? I think Ryan's been really good about this. this in the past, like, you know, got Chris in there a couple times and that sort of things.  So, you know, like Ryan said, it's, it's understanding what the situation is and like having more conversations and dialogue about it.  Like, is there even a chance for our client to get in there or not? Um, yeah. So, and then equally we need to manage the expectations of clients, right?  Like, with DL. They're in a highly competitive market. Also, I was just at a searcher about 90 searchers in Miami, you know, like they also have a ton of money and more than half the room were full time searchers.  So, like, they are going to have to deal with the fact that things are competitive. It's just the market the way it is now.  So, we can manage the client's expectations, like, hey, things are competitive. If you want any chance at any of these, you need to move fast, right?  But what I guess the whole point of the Austin conversation was like, let's not lose them the opportunity because we are not moving fast enough.

13:09 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah. And that normally doesn't happen. Yeah.

13:14 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Right. But you know, now with David here processing things on a daily basis and like the second things hit the market, we should be we should be flying through those, you know, once we get into our rhythm.  And David, I know that's a ton of pressure you just got here couple weeks ago, but that's what we're aiming towards, right?  that we catch things before our clients do. And that's something I don't know if you guys have picked up on that, but a lot of our clients are scanning listings right now.  Why do you think that happens?

13:43 - Luke Gillespie
  Because they think we're not doing our job.

13:46 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Well, what are they not getting?

13:50 - Luke Gillespie
  Deals.

13:51 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Right. So they're doing our job for us because they're not getting the things that they think they should be getting.  So it's not that you guys are. doing a lot. But remember, I talk about this lot. Perception is reality, right?  So they're showing us that they don't think we're catching everything by going and scanning everything themselves and then giving us a long list of things that they did.  So it's like, when that happens, I know you guys are actioning it, but also looking at like, did we miss that?  If we did, why did we miss it? Or how do we get quicker? Or how do we get more volume to them?  So they don't have the time to scan listings. Like, most of them are getting in a month six, seven, eight with us.  That's a lot of money for them. They're worried this is never going to happen. Perception is reality. Like that is a sign of somebody that's concerned.  So the ways that we can help that is, you know, just getting better, like 1% better every day.

15:00 - AcquiMatch Team
  Do you ever play poker Luke?

15:04 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah.

15:05 - AcquiMatch Team
  Okay, so when you're on these calls with these buyers, you know, when you play poker, right? Like if you have good cards, you're usually very confident at the table, right?  You can make bets and just feel very comfortable because you have good cards. I think it's important when you go into these poker calls to have the mindset.  You have very good cards. And they don't know that. They don't know what cards you have. So you, but you have great cards.  You're probably well, well more prepared than majority of the potential buyers that you close with. You're representing someone who we financially qualified and they're paying us money to ask him in the game and ready to move forward.  Right? So come with that conference. call it and when they say they'll have other LLLs, I kind of, I show that I have good cards.  I'm like, okay, like, are they in the Austin area? Well, one of them is, okay, got you, you know, did I have, I see that, you know, you said that they, they need sales experience, does this only have sales experience?  No, they have, right, okay, my, our sales experience, right? And then I, I think it would, it'd be a good idea to consider my car.  I have a real body ready to go fire. so, yeah, if I wanted him to be considered on this, I think you should be considered on this.  You know, what's the last day you're going to stop accepting LLLs?

16:46 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah, right.

16:48 - AcquiMatch Team
  So kind of just nudge yourself in there, because they're, I mean, talking about this is reality, we have good cards when we go this calls.  This is not just like, we're, we're asking for them to work with us like we're begging. can we change work with you?  That's not the way it is. They want to make money and we have that, but they're not going to know it unless we make it obvious to them, right?  So this is good to talk about now because that's this is a competitive market and you're going to need to kind of take that stance on some of these because they're going to have their interested parties and so you want to make it known that we have very attractive buyers and they're going to want to at least speak with them.
  ACTION ITEM: Create talk track script for competitive deal situations. Include examples from Ryan's suggestions + own ideas. Scan during broker calls. - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/244889741?timestamp=1040.9999

17:27 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah, exactly. That's a great point.

17:31 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  It's an excellent point Ryan and Luke, I would like you to grab the bathroom transcripts and write up a little talk talk for yourself, right?  So like using those examples that Ryan just gave and then writing more so that when others are otherwise and then you can scan that when that conversation comes out and be like, remind yourself of the things that you could ask in that moment.  Well, you know, are Are they local to Austin? Are they private equity or is it an individual like, does the owner care about the person taking it over?  they want someone that's going to like be in the business or is it someone that's going to sell it, you know, like, you know, these buyer profiles backwards and forwards and you also know the profile of what typically people come in like and make offers, you know.  So I think it's an amazing point that Ryan made and I really love to see a script, you know, like in those moments where it is competitive, what are the tactics and things that we can use, which is, you know, essentially overcoming objections, but in a different way.  So the broker starts questioning what he did, which is just get the broker question whether he actually did have somebody that was going to get it done, right?  And we're like, we have someone that can get, and also with Justin, what did he get a nine million pre-qualification, like, come on, you know, it's like our buyer has a nine million dollar pre-qualification.  like does the other buyers have that? I can send you his letter right now, you know? Like that like he he's going to be able to get this done.  He's got us buying to do the other buyers and the individuals. Do they have advisors that are actually going to help them get the deal done?  Like there's so many things. So you can pull all these things that I just said that Ryan said, give yourself a talk track and essentially what you want is them questioning if they did get the right buyer in those otherwise or if they're missing out, like the fear of missing out, the fear of missing something is real.

19:36 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah, uh-huh.

19:42 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  It's such a good point, Ryan. I forget that I would do that too. Like if a broker was like, no, I'm like, no, no, no, hang on a minute.  Like you were missing something, your dude, like you were going to miss out on the buyer of the century.  So it's like we're not just selling ourselves. We're also like giving them an advantage and bigging them up. So that's by the time Mr.  If any client shows up with the broker, they're kind of like, oh, sir, you know, um, Yeah.

20:08 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah, good point. I added it to my questions.

20:12 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  You can also with the awesome brokers check if I know them. Like, have I had a conversation with before?  Do I have a connection with them? You'll be able to see that, I think, in the CRM. And you can ask me like, hey, I'm having a call with so and so do you know that I'm like, there's a monthly meetup that I've been going to for a year and a half.  go to the Texas Association of Business Workers event.

20:36 - Luke Gillespie
  I'm starting to get well known in these communities.

20:39 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So like, that also can give you an edge because they like me. And they know that the banks like us and what we do and, you know, went to the Texas Association of Business Workers event.  Initially, it was like, they're all like, ah, and then they're like, I heard you have qualified buyers. think I do.  Which one would you like? You know, I felt like drug dealer, like, come on in. So yeah, usually you got we can we can create that advantage because it's like this buyer is qualified lives here is an awesome person is going to make a great business owner and has the firepower of us behind them that are going to help them get them closed.  Yeah.

21:24 - Luke Gillespie
  Good point. We got the ACES on firstly.
  ACTION ITEM: Analyze DL deal flow. Prep update for next meeting. Consider postcode searches vs industry. Coordinate w/ Anka on search possibilities. - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/244889741?timestamp=1286.9999

21:28 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Oh, yeah. Yeah. Nice. Okay. other deal flow that we were concerned about is DL. So what, what are we thinking about there?

21:43 - AcquiMatch Team
  Hey, I was going to take a dive into that today and we were playing on discussing that morning.

21:49 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay. So next, next meeting, you guys will have an update for me.

21:54 - AcquiMatch Team
  Yeah, right on this table, bring out what he found just looking through what we have in motion, buddy. I'm digging around and depending on what that is, I might even start looking around as well.  I'll just get an idea where we are in terms of geopilot mainly because I understand the area because I used to live in the area and so it's a long area but there's so many cities, I may need to check searches and just make sure like an area is not getting missed because we put a West Palm Beach but Del Rey is not getting included in that search.

22:34 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So if we haven't like, look at like postcode searches rather than industry related searches.

22:47 - AcquiMatch Team
  Yeah, that's that's what we actually we discussed that today and Anka was going to talk to some about if that was possible.  Does she even get a response already on that today? You guys know I know yet she tagged she tagged me in something she said to the song I haven't read that yet, but Marco was going to look into that.  But we discussed that this morning.

23:19 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay, great. I don't have anything to add on that. Cool. Do you want to talk through clients and deals kind of Sure.
  ACTION ITEM: Send "Acquiring Minds" podcast ep (Carlos on $13M biz w/ no personal guarantee/investors) to Jason - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/244889741?timestamp=1417.9999  Also, is there anything that I can be of use or help you guys with rather than just reporting to me.

23:48 - Luke Gillespie
  Is this the podcast you wanted the acquiring minds episode you wanted sent to Jason was it Carlos and tell me how to buy a $13 million business with no personal guarantee no investors.

23:59 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah.

24:00 - Luke Gillespie
  Okay.

24:00 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah. Anka actually flagged it for me too. Yeah. That one is good. Oh. So that's on on CMDL, C-M's deal, Ryan, I think you should listen to that podcast, because if there's that much real estate in it, what this guy basically did was the owner thought the real estate was worth five million with the rents that he was agreeing to pay with business.  He was able to sign up simultaneously, sell the property and lease it back to himself. And he was able to sell it for 10 million.  So he was doing an overall $13 million deal. For the business and the real estate, which the real estate was only five million of that, but he was able to get 10 million through doing the sales back, got the seller to do a portion of seller financing.  So then he only had to come up with like a couple million in capital. So with Chris's. like that might be something for him to consider the sale lease back thing.  know he was talking about like getting real estate investors involved, but this might be a different play for him too.

25:12 - AcquiMatch Team
  Yeah, you're looking at that look in some of the link and I'll check that out.

25:16 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah, I'll send it right in.

25:19 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  I just listened to it last night, but the way the guy was like, like he only does proprietary. He like really spends a lot of time like trying to make it easy for the owner, but also that confidence going in like, you get this for me, I'm going to put millions of dollars in your pocket, you know, like I think Jason's like walking on a shelf.  like, no dude, like do you want millions of dollars in time with your grandkids? Like, I this from them.  And I don't think it's going to be as easy as Jason thinks. And that's why I keep trying to push him to like, this is not going to be easy to do diligence process.  says and you should also not skip the due diligence process just because Pino's like being weird about it.

26:07 - AcquiMatch Team
  Yeah, I know. Yeah, you just kind of like, you got to have just us like a gut feeling high.  It's like, yeah, you got to verify this.

26:23 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, and he's going to have to go through the process of like the modernizing the books anyway. I just, I don't, yeah, you can't do a gut feel on something.  Anyways, it's a good episode. Good tactic. think all of us, it's a really interesting tool of the toolkit. only thing that makes me a little bit uncomfortable is it feels a little bit like screwing the seller out of money.  Like you're paying them five million and immediately selling it for 10. It's kind of . No, no, no, it's at the time of sale, like the whole transaction is done simultaneously.

27:16 - AcquiMatch Team
  Oh, really? It's volatile. doesn't understand better.

27:19 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah. So basically, like at the time of sale, the real estate is purchased by investors and immediately back to me, the business buyer, and I am agreeing to lease it at a certain amount of rent for like a 20 year lease.  So it's for commercial real estate investors that just want to own a property and like that rent that's going to be coming through for the next 20 years.  So they'll offer like more in rent than the previous owner was paying in order to do that to Jack because it's based on cap rate, which is based on rent.  Andrew will break this all down for us on Thursday a little bit further. But it's an interesting, interesting play.

28:04 - AcquiMatch Team
  Okay.

28:09 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay, cool. Anything else? Let's see. We talked about, uh, So you're going to get him an off market. So how did it go with that guy?  You had another call with him?

28:27 - AcquiMatch Team
  I did. Um, yep, I gave, I used the tier to 4x. I used that one on a call. Um, so, um, here's, put this slide about it.  Uh, was like, so what you think about that? It's just like, uh, 2x, no, uh, 4x, I will consider.  So 4x, we put the business about $7, about $7 million, uh, which, it's a very interesting, it's a very interesting business.  It is a nice business. It's really good. Like Andrew's going to look at it big day now. It's there.  It's nice. So it would just be from there it'll come down to the money and how much it is and if he thinks that's something he can take on.  It's Canadian based, which is, you know, we talked about that with SBA lenders. We don't know how they're going look at that.  But I joined, I signed up for the Live Oak call tomorrow and I'm actually going to borrow that call and ask all my questions and see what happens there.
  ACTION ITEM: Call w/ Chris tmrw. Discuss podcast ideas re: real estate play. Ask Live Oak SBA Qs re: Canadian biz. Prep w/ podcast if time. - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/244889741?timestamp=1765.9999  I've already read the call and I have some real estate adjacent questions for the Christmas markets. Well, I have a call of Chris tomorrow, so I'm going to do all that tomorrow.

29:49 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay cool. I would give that podcast to listen before your call with Chris if you can, just to like do it on like two acts just to get an overview of like the concept.  Because I think he could use that play, and he has enough realistic people in his back pocket that he could probably do something like that.  So, but the guy was able to skip conventional financing altogether doing that. Got it. And we could, I see a world where like he would be able to get investment into this to make up whatever the differences on the SBA and or private, private capital is also an option and I have people, private lenders that not many people would I introduce them to but Andrew is one I would like, because I can't introduce just anybody to these people that burns my relationships with them, but I just want to say that to you for for  The clients that I would back myself, Andrew is one of them, I feel very strongly in him as an operator and this is like sounds like a really strong, you know, background attachment to the business itself.  So I'm saying all that because if he gets scared about the 7 million price tag, just remind him that there's ways of overcoming that in multitudes of ways we can help him with that so.  So, um, and then once we know on the Canadian thing also that'd be good for us to chat about.

31:35 - AcquiMatch Team
  Yeah. Cool.

31:44 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  That's exciting. Oh, that'll be a good one for him to sink his teeth into so hopefully he'll stop screwing the things again.

31:50 - AcquiMatch Team
  Yeah.

31:51 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So we missed that one because it came in over the weekend basically.

31:55 - AcquiMatch Team
  he's just sitting on the side.

31:58 - Luke Gillespie
  It was, you know, was in our, it was in. prep Monday morning. It's just he sent it to us on Sunday.

32:03 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  We caught it though.

32:04 - AcquiMatch Team
  Yeah. Well, yeah.

32:05 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah.

32:05 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay. Good. Good.

32:07 - Luke Gillespie
  That was on the last one too. He got it the day it was listed on Sunday or Saturday and we got it on Monday.

32:14 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  . All right. Well, this this one should show on people that just came through my sales coach to write like it was that one.

32:22 - AcquiMatch Team
  Yeah, really quality.

32:24 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Well, yeah, because I think my sales coach coached this guy on his sales. So, and they usually only take people that are doing like a hundred K a month above.

32:36 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah.

32:38 - AcquiMatch Team
  Yeah, it's doing $4 million revenue.

32:41 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Nice. Cool. Um, great. What else on the client front?

32:49 - AcquiMatch Team
  Hey, I have a call with her tomorrow where I'm going to kind of discuss like, Hey, you know, I gave you a week to think about this.  What do you think? Where are you? Did you have? Have anything you want me to maybe talk about on that call or.

33:07 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  No, we talked about it. think it's. Just we're concerned. This is a big play. And if we're having this many issues thus far, you know, when you're in ownership, we're not going to be around.  Is this really the play for you, you know, like? In your own words, but just I would invite her to just.  Reflect on the last four. Five months of working with us and, you know, we've, we've. Most people would have looked at it or spoken to at least.  Ten to. Fifteen businesses by this point. I mean. So yeah, just like invited a reflect. How are you feeling about things?  Like, is this really how you want to move forward? It's going to be pretty intense, you know, even to get something under offer and do diligence.  And then even worse, like when you have to own the business, you know, Okay, good.

34:23 - Luke Gillespie
  Oh, maybe she's maybe she wants something just less workload that's going to be in lower, you know, lower purchase price, not as much of a commitment for her, Ryan, kind of like some of our clients have switched back and forth between them.

34:37 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Those don't exist though. Like, I don't think they do.

34:42 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah, but definitely some are going to be easier and harder than others.

34:46 - AcquiMatch Team
  That's why the business, that's why I really push on that bike business.

34:51 - Luke Gillespie
  But yeah, yeah, it's a retail store.

34:53 - AcquiMatch Team
  Like, you know, literally just manage that people and, you know, I've. spend some time in the bike shops because they used to ride and if they're slow, there's not like, it's pretty easy gig.  So I'm going to figure concerned with her isn't the business.

35:12 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  It's like, is she, we put her that bike business in front of her months ago and she hasn't moved forward on it.  So like, it's not about the business. It's like, is this in general buying a business under your condition. The right thing for you because we don't feel, you know, we've been concerned about your health and most people at this stage would have been under offer, making offers, looked at 10 to 15 businesses, you know, and so putting you in a situation where you could potentially bankrupt yourself because this comes up a lot, like, doesn't feel good to us.  So let's have a real conversation about it. cool um that pretty much goes to everybody.

36:05 - AcquiMatch Team
  JJ, what's what's going on with JJ? We just started our search yesterday. I mean kind of really enjoying up for our search yesterday um Luke found a business that he likes for her um but it's actually one of the brokers uh same brokers from a previous deal that we sent her and we haven't got her feedback on that deal yet um so Luke reached out asking her uh make we have another business slip from the same broker but we need to get you to close this one out before we move forward of course because this is the same broker um sort of putting on our response from her.

36:40 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Great okay cool um nice uh any concerns deal flow wise for anyone how we live in?

36:50 - AcquiMatch Team
  Only deal what we discussed which we're gonna we're gonna get into that further tomorrow.

36:57 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Cool um I got uh, Dave and I have come to an agreement, Dave Collinson. Um, so we're going to get it in writing.  And then once we get that signed, then we'll give you guys access to his list of off market opportunities.  And it's going to be like hundreds of businesses on there.

37:21 - AcquiMatch Team
  Um, but there's a good amount of info on each of them.

37:25 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So then you guys will be able to pick all the ones that you want them to see if they're available or not.  If they are and they make an introduction, we pay for an introduction. And then we pay again, if we introduce it to the client, and then if we close, we give a substantial fee to him.  Uh, it's a fraction of what he would earn. If one of his own client flows, but it looks like from what he was showing me, it looked like it was a good amount of volume on there.  I think there's a fair amount of Florida deals in there too. Um, but that should potentially give us some off market conversations.  while we're figuring out our own off-market process in the meantime, because unless Dave's open to me buying him at some point, I don't want to become reliant on him for off-market sourcing.  Because he is technically a competitor, and because we were mentioned on the same process, everybody that comes and speaks to me also goes and speaks to him.  Oh, I found where did it go? I think, did I put that here? I'll give one for you guys to look into.  He got in touch in my LinkedIn, and he actually looks pretty good, and the pricing is very reasonable. Did that go through?  Oh, hang on. Ignore that, let's delete that. Watch this little video for M&A professionals on automated deal sourcing, but pricing is pretty reasonable and it's like a monthly thing too to be able to try it out so that might be another avenue for off-market.  Because I think our whole process of what we're building out, it will take longer, like ideally we want to not be reliant on external sources, but at the moment we have active clients that we just need to get more deal flow to.  So something I would like to So challenge you all is could we get at least three to up right up per client this month now that we have David taking care of the beginning of funnel stuff.

40:12 - AcquiMatch Team
  What do you guys think about that?

40:15 - Luke Gillespie
  Let's go.

40:18 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  I mean, ideally, it'd be a write up a week per client because Ryan's also doing some of the off market.  I don't want to push it too far. But I think let's try to get off the minimum block. You know, like the minimums aren't enough because clients are going out and doing their own searches again.  So if we can try to boost that volume of deal flow up and good fitting deals, too, I think that's the other thing that's like when we put something in front of them and they don't like it.  A lot of times, like what they're saying is really the real reason. So we can dig a little bit deeper, you know, like with the med spa thing, I'm like, is it really that they don't like the broker or they just  maybe don't actually like meds boss or the idea of meds boss right and it's like well hang on you know so like Ryan on that one I'd get on a call with them and be like hey there's an opportunity for you to look at that in industry that you said you were open to um you know even if there's other offers you're in Miami it's going to be competitive no matter what so you need to get used to competition and how to make yourself stand out as a buyer there's good opportunity for you to learn and practice on this one so is there something else you're not saying about why you don't like this deal or is it worth you going through it the wine that we're not said that like I just want to keep replaying back to them is it costs you nothing to move forward with these things it literally costs you nothing to move forward and have these conversations the only thing you have to lose is the knowledge and the reps and the ability to like actually take it

42:00 - Luke Gillespie
  action and learn from this. Yeah.

42:07 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So all of their objections turn into a positive learning experience. Like, there's too much competition. Well, you're in Miami and it's one of the most competitive markets.  So now you have an opportunity on a deal that you don't feel that excited about to learn how to make yourself stand out.  Something that my girlfriend said a long time ago, she's like, when I go on a date, I don't care whether I like, like, I just try to make his experience really great.  And then I'm always the one that gets to choose whether I want to go on a second date or not.  So if I'm my most shiny, amazing, exciting, engaging self, then she's like, I never have somebody not want to like, they always ask me out on a second date.  And then I get to choose whether I go on a second date or not, because I showed up and I was like, fully in it and giving my all.  So You know, it's kind of, clients have that opportunity. It's like, okay, you don't like it, we'll still show up and get that broker to want you.  Like, because they're gonna have another deal and they're gonna remember you. So you still have an opportunity to develop a relationship and maybe not this one, but you get to learn about an industry.  This one already has a license involved, which is like, you know, we've done deals before where they didn't, and it's a whole pain in the .  And, you know, Andy gets to like decide whether you like the med spa industry. I found a company that like actually does like two different companies that do like lead generation for med spas and they do all the booking and everything.  So they don't even need to do this initial sales themselves. Like there's these companies that like specialize in med spas, getting them clients in Delray Beach, like near Miami, people are getting, that is not something that like goes away.  And even for sessions, women will still find the money. to pay for their face. I'm not kidding. Like that is non-negotiable expense for them.

44:07 - Luke Gillespie
  And isn't medspar like one of the hottest industries for small business acquisition similar to HVAC?

44:12 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  I know it's not as hot as HVAC, but I swear I've heard a lot about medsparas as well. Well, even Eli had two under offer.

44:20 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah.

44:20 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Oh my god, you all, I met with Eli last week that I met him after. Guess what? What did I predict Ryan?

44:29 - AcquiMatch Team
  Yeah, sick of that job.

44:39 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, he's like, oh, I don't really like any of the people that I work with, and I'm realizing I'm 61, and you know, if we want to retire, I need to be generating wealth, and I'm not doing it fast enough, I'm like, you don't say.  You mean those two medspots that would have been spitting off half a million dollars a year, you walked away from me.  and having both of them under offer, like, so that you could get the big job at the company you always wanted to work for, like, come on.  I was, I, it took, it took a lot not to say exactly that. It did her. Like, well, now, you know, to trust your gut and push our other clients harder.

45:25 - Luke Gillespie
  No, I mean, I knew it at the time, right?

45:28 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Ryan saw the whole deal blow up and it's probably when he said, I mean, it talks to clients the way that I like, I literally had to sit, you lie down like a child, be like, no, down, talk to your wife, go through these questions, do not come back to me until you've done that.  And he's like, and I was like, you chose to interrupt me on my vacation. So this is my advice and you need to  take it.  You know, it's just like one of those where he was like, It was not I don't I don't have to speak to them like that all the time, but it was one of those moments where I was like you're acting like a  child and that's how I'm going to speak to you now.  But yeah, so anyways, meds balls are are great opportunities for the right people. I don't think either of them partake in any of that stuff.  So that would be my question as to why a med spa for them. But if they put it down on their list of potentials, then Ryan, you got to push them and be like, you guys put every industry under the sun on this list.  And the only way you're going to figure out whether you like him or not is going further and having these conversations like why are you interested in meds buzz do you know enough about meds buzz.  If you don't get on the phone learn about meds buzz and then we can eliminate it if it's not a good fit, but neither of them are getting work done.  You know, like, so why meds pause for them? Oh, good stuff. Anything else you want to update Luke? Any challenges or deals you want to talk to?

47:17 - Luke Gillespie
  you feeling good? Nope. Yeah, I'm good.

47:20 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  David, how are you feeling? You're getting the reins of the whole beginning of the funnel.

47:24 - David R
  No pressure. A little bit of pressure, but.

47:28 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah.

47:28 - David R
  Yeah, you were responsible for deal flow now. Yeah.

47:36 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  It gets quicker as you go through it too. I'm sure you'll come up like, you know, learning it is learning how things go.  And I was thinking about you and you're talking about that, you know, the first 90 days. It's like you just got to kind of learn a system and learn how everything is connected and how it works before you can start changing it.  Because little changes can end up like impacting the whole thing. Like, we just found out that when we handed over something.  then it wasn't it was done in a different way and that like that ended up having an impact that we didn't realize, you know, on overall deal flow and stuff.  So there's a reason for each and the little things, the way that we do things. So once you learn all those, then you can get in and start changing it and making it better.  But it does take some time to just kind of like, especially with 10 active clients to remember all their profiles as you're going through that and stuff, you know.  But what's cool is when a new one comes on, we all get to know him at the same time and you'll only have like a couple at a time as opposed to trying to learn and all at once.  And cool. Awesome. Nice work guys. I'm excited. Let's be ambitious. Let's go for each at least. You can do it.  No, I mean, we'll know what we'll know we're doing good when we when we stop getting the kinds of things from clients, right?  So like that's not that we're not hitting our minimums and hitting our contractual requirements, but the perception will have shifted when people stop scanning listings, you know?  So that's what we're kind of aiming for is like, do people feel like they're getting good quality deal flow, keeping them busy enough that they're not going out and being like, where is it, where is it, you know, like I'm panicking, I'm not going to find it, I've been at this for a while, like where is it, so it's that perception shift will change and we'll be able to see, okay, either we're finding better quality deals that they're spending more time on and getting their teeth under going further on and or we're sending them more quality deals or more quantity of deals that is also keeping them busy, you know?  So we'll get there, y'all are doing good, cool, have a good rest of your day, I'll see you all soon!

50:00 - AcquiMatch Team
  It's a good night.

50:01 - Luke Gillespie
  See you. Thank you.
