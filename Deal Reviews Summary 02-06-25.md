  Hey, Luke, how do y'all think that went?

0:14 - Luke Gillespie
  Good.

0:16 - AcquiMatch Team
  Yeah, go ahead. Really? But... It's kind of hard to pull solid stuff from them.

0:40 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  That's why I was trying to... With the rant kind of touch on some of the things, but... It's hard to do these open sessions if they don't have...  Like if we don't have people teed up to talk through things, it's like kind of hard to fill the airtime.  And I'm like, okay, nobody's saying anything like that. It was good, you know, they started asking questions or saying things that they wanted at the end, but I'm just thinking in future ones for the open sessions, like getting, like.  I'll have to bring on our financial modeling or, you know, gills quiet on all of these and I'm like, he's  spamming you with like 5 million questions, right?  Like, why isn't he talking on buyers club about the things he's going to. So, maybe we just need to like.  This is the same way.

1:30 - AcquiMatch Team
  Chris talks and talks and talks and talks and he doesn't say anything on buyers club.

1:35 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Does he even come?

1:36 - AcquiMatch Team
  Was he there? He wasn't there. That's, that's the thing. I think it must be something with fluke and gill about the group conversations because they are some of the most talkative ones and they talk police on the spot.

1:47 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  I mean, we need to give him a little push, you know.

1:51 - AcquiMatch Team
  Yeah, Kristoff definitely needs a push on the phone. You know, we're sick. I brought, I just said, anybody else have anything?  I think I was a Chris, and then he started talking, right? he does need to be called on.

2:05 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Maybe if I try calling him Gil, Gil, you're working through a couple of deals right now, how is it going?  OK, so maybe if you feed me the ones that I can call on that are actively working on things that you think would be good to help them through it, then it puts them on the spot, because they might not offer it up.  But, you know, I think you could definitely use some, like, Athena coaching by the looks of things, like.

2:37 - Luke Gillespie
  I agree with you. I think they, like, calling them out and bringing up their specific deals could kind of make them more talkative.  when you're talking about Joe having difficult relationship with his off-market, off-market seller, was thinking about, like, you should hear out what Jason would do with his off-market seller, because Jason was in that call that you could have brought up, like, oh, Jason, do you want to talk about how he rejected your first LOI in an hour or something like that?  It's Jason's from my view at Ryan are you not am I wrong or wasn't Jason's negotiations with Tariq much more difficult than what Joe's doing with Pino.

3:11 - AcquiMatch Team
  It's a good point.

3:13 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Jason never broke a sweat.

3:15 - Luke Gillespie
  He just stayed focused and it kept a positive attitude and he just kept trying to make it work. You know Joe like gets one LOI revision and he's the guy or something.

3:26 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  He's trying to screw him again. If you don't want this like we'll take it. Nice little finders for it.  Somebody's gonna come in 5x all cash.

3:38 - Luke Gillespie
  Take that off your hands. No problem. Excuse me. Yeah, I know. Excuse me. Yeah. When you were bringing up the multiples today, I know and keep talking about this but he's looking at a 3.5x and he's disappointed in that.  I don't think I've ever even seen an H back at less than a 4x. Especially one that's doing any SDE near like 500k.  Yeah.

4:03 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, he's taking it personal though, like he, he's got a trust thing going on.

4:16 - AcquiMatch Team
  Yeah, he lost the other HVAC because of that same reason we wanted to offer, like we're, we were close on that one and then they're, we accepted another offer because he was dragging it out.  He thought they were, they submitted some numbers and then we got revised numbers and they were much lower and then Joe was like, he thought they were trying to lie to them and then I was like, don't think that's it.  And he was like pointing out how the numbers are wrong and then they, they accepted another offer. We don't know what it was, but he got eliminated himself from that one.  So did you remind him of that? Yeah, well not that specific thing, but I said like, you know, we had some other ones that we wanted.  Oh, one benefit is that there's no one else there for him to go to so you have room to negotiate here, you know But don't take too long because we saw having to even Eli Yeah, that's why so I said don't as I don't take too long message him like today if you can And say hey, can we do a sit down?  Either tomorrow or one day and then we talked about all the things we should cover.

5:26 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So that's what he's gonna do Awesome. So we actually have a good amount of time today.

5:32 - AcquiMatch Team
  So what would you like to chat through Ryan? Yes, awesome. Just you know, I have a call with Stephen Paul at the top of the hour I I have to run because I'm speaking at the event that Justin is gonna come to tonight.

5:44 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So Okay, Austin's searcher of it and I'm on the panel with He shares who's apparently starting their own deal sourcing uh mastermind community course thing and so they were hosting this event  at mean shares. They'd already asked me to be a speaker and the organizer was like, yeah, they got really pissed off with us because they're like, we don't want to give airtime to our competitors.  And I was like, what? They like are helping people with investor capital. And he's like, yeah, apparently they're starting a course and like mastermind and a deal sourcing thing.  And I was like, good luck with that. And then there's another guy that sounds like he's the Dave Collinson, but for larger deals where they just like source the larger deals, but don't do the advisory and that sort of thing.  So I'm interested to meet him and hear what he's doing because like on the sales calls when somebody comes to me and they're not a first time buyer and they just want paid lists and they want really big deals, I'm like, let me refer you out to someone, you know, because it's just not not a good fit for us for them to be like going through our process.  So I've been pretty hard-nosed about only working with first time buyers. Because I think that's where our niche and our skillset is going to.  But it's nice to like when you get someone that's like good person, you know, like want to help them out, but I've just been sending him to Dave Collins, and Dave wrote me recently and he's like, look, anything over a million, any of it is really hard for us, I'm like, okay.  So, anyways, yeah, I'm on a panel and I'll be, I think, in a kind of debate situation. So, that would be fun.

7:32 - AcquiMatch Team
  I got my money on you.

7:36 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Thanks. Maria's coming, my boyfriend's coming, Justin's coming, like his search hasn't started yet. So hopefully we've impressed him enough that he feels like he's in good hands, but like, you know, he's not getting deals yet.  And then there's two potential clients that are also going to be there too, but I'm basically going to say like we only take one Austin client at a time because y'all are crazy.

8:00 - AcquiMatch Team
  you're gonna find a business in this market doing it on your own.

8:03 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  And you are only client that's getting the Austin markets here, you know. Like he grabbed the spot as soon as Lindsay and Kevin were out.  So it'll it'll be fun.

8:13 - AcquiMatch Team
  But yeah, anyways, I gotta, I gotta go with the top of the hour.

8:18 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  All right, get myself ramped up. I'm wearing red and leopard print to get all my power patterns and color ready to go.

8:28 - AcquiMatch Team
  So, you know, I want to get into it after this, but he told me that story about how you wore the red dress and then she put a picture of you in the red dress on there.  Yeah, I told that story to my girlfriend because we were laughing. was like, after he's holding me, I was like laughing in my head that he told me that and I thought she was laughing.

8:47 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  And my recent post had the picture of me in the background wearing the exact same dress that I'm wearing.  Like, yeah, they posted the picture of me. I'm like, oh, God.

9:00 - AcquiMatch Team
  Alright, let's see if we can get to everybody to say, I usually start. Look, why don't you start?

9:08 - Luke Gillespie
  Yes, so I'll give overall rundown on how many write-ups we've gone out so far, four write-ups, one catering business to SP, one is a landscaping business in Colorado, I just gave to Chris last night, one is that diesel repair shop I've been talking about to Andrew, and then I also just another metal fabrication shop to Andrew, so that's where we're at, I've been doing the calculations in my head, if I do one write-up every day this month that will meet minimums for everyone, so I always try to keep myself on the mental pace of one write-up a day, so I didn't get one out on Monday, I didn't get one out on Monday, so I was screaming like pushing out two yesterday, and now I got one out today, I'm hopefully gonna get out two tomorrow, but yeah, so that's where we're at with write-ups, and then other than that, I've mostly just been focusing on DL and GL, those were kind of our priorities for the week, I found a pet grooming business for Gil.  Oh, that I am just trying to get the broker on a call him and I were kind of chasing each other back and forth today I'm gonna try to get him tomorrow.  It's a multi location pet grooming shop and pet service shop They have 10 locations all across New York and New Jersey Like a million dollars even done but only listed at $3.2 million asking price.  So really good SDE for Gil and then for DL I have what was it it was I have a deal that I'm trying to get the broker on the call as well Where do they go?  Excuse me. Oh, yes, it's a body shop It's a Gonna include real estate that could qualify for the the 504 low or 25 year amort and 6% Interest rate so it's looking interesting I'm just trying to schedule the broker.  It just came into the end box today Yeah, I'm just trying to get him on the phone. So that's what we're after those two, and that's been my focus all week.

11:07 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay, questions on personality fit for both of those. How are you, how are you seeing the connection?

11:14 - Luke Gillespie
  For the BL, one thing that I noticed that would be on red flag is that the owner is currently doing the sales, and I know they are not interested in sales, so I was gonna make sure to ask questions about that to the broker and learn more about it.

11:32 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  But so my question is on like the type of business too, like how do you see DL being a good auto body shop owner?

11:41 - Luke Gillespie
  You make a good point, yeah, because then Destin has more computer programming background. To be honest, I still a lot of RFIs, and we just haven't gotten that many cents for them, so I'm waiting to get more sense.  So that's one of the only good businesses that has come in so far for them that has a high  I've seen a couple that came in on that kind of have lower SD, and I don't want to show them on their first business, something that is a really good one.

12:12 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  And they said they were in the auto body on their.

12:16 - Luke Gillespie
  They are open there, their industry sheet is very open there, they're open almost everything.

12:25 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  They've said the sales thing like 5 million times, so I don't know if this feels like. A first business to put in front of them.

12:35 - Luke Gillespie
  Okay.

12:37 - AcquiMatch Team
  So. I'm playing devil's here. So I've been pushing Luke this week to like try to get them something because I really want people to get something in their first week.  And because they were so open. I was like, let's get them looking at something. And I don't think if we think we don't get them anything, if we don't get them this one, I think they're going to get a zero and week one.  And I on my call with that was like you're on open to a lot of stuff that we want to see things we want to just we don't want to close ourselves off anything so this can be the start of my I'm going to present the business to them.  And I'm going to like reference all these things so highlight the sales thing I know but here's this is the beginning of your calibration period.  Right. And so I'll make it an educational experience for them, letting them know. It's your first week. We're still requesting exams.  We're still looking at businesses. This is one of the first ones, whether you're criteria want to get in front of you.  Things through it. What do you think?

13:39 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah. I mean, there's two schools of thought, you know, it's like, it's their first impression. So that that can be like, out of a body and sales, like, are you guys actually good at what you do?  But I also take your point about the college. So I think, you know, if there's nothing else in the pipeline, it looks like it would be more of a direct hit.  Because I, you know, we tell them like your, your first deal might take a couple weeks to come through.  I like the getting them a deal first, but like, what's the risk of waiting a few more days, getting them a direct hit that they're really excited about versus getting them something in their first week.  Where the owners doing the sales that we know they have, they've said on literally every single call I had and the calls with you about how much they don't like sales.

14:39 - AcquiMatch Team
  So the risk is we go a few more days. We still don't find something that's a direct hit for them.

14:46 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  And they're looking at service sitting on their hands.

14:49 - AcquiMatch Team
  I think I can make it crazy in a way that would be okay. Like if you told me to put it on a body shop, was like, the guys doing sales, but how much sales do you need in a body shop?  If you get an accident with a car, you need to. placed. mean, that's the way body shops work, right?  You don't really need to sell, you just need to be customer service friendly. I know I used to work with body shops all the time, so I don't think it's a big sales-y thing.  It's like a customer service role. You're just like, oh yeah, just always your car, you need a tote to me.  I'll take care of your tote over here. make sure you're taking care of. That's more of a role of body shops.

15:21 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  I'll explain it like that. So then I think on the first one, think about how like, you know, getting on the phone with them, explaining it first, maybe Luke doesn't do the video walkthrough, so you can kind of like talk them through everything.  Like just think of that, you know, if they're getting the write-up before they have a conversation with you, and you like, as long as we position it in a way that's like, hey, this is your calibration period and we want to get in like, in your so open-on industry, we need to start testing you on so  some of these things. And also every business is going to have an element of sales, this one, you know, I have experience with body shops, just like everything you said.  So it's like, it's better for us to get this out of the way early on to just temperature check how comfortable you are with that, because every business is going to have the like an element of the owner needing to be able to jump into sales if something goes wrong.

16:25 - AcquiMatch Team
  Right. And then look, you can still make the video, but just make it for me. I'll watch the video just to get updated with it.  then I'll present it myself.

16:34 - Luke Gillespie
  So yeah, sounds good. And yeah, you're right. You know, I was thinking about that when I was listening to DLs onboarding calls, like, at some point, I'm sure Ryan's gonna have to tell them that in this small business space, almost every company, the owner is doing sales, very rarely is there actually a sales team.  And so there they might have to start thinking about how they would hire that out or just start just let me start thinking about it.  Because owners always do sales, but I'm sure. I mean, it's like small business owner responsibility.

17:05 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Number one is chief revenue officer, you know. So Ryan, if you use this as like, hey, we know you don't want to do like they kept saying like door to door sales or cold calling.

17:16 - AcquiMatch Team
  It's like every business is going to have an element of sales.

17:20 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  That is your job as a business owner, chief revenue officer, you were the one responsible for getting enough revenue in the door to pay your people, right.  So we want you to get acclimated and like get exposure to these things as early as possible and also start testing out different industries.  All the team, you know, it takes a little bit like the calibration period, we just want you getting practice.  And then the team, you know, a bit more time is going to bring you more of those direct hit businesses.  And by that point, you'll have had some of these conversations, some of these calibration aspects so that, you know, those conversations go better.  So as long as you position it as like there is a reason for this, we are the experts, you need to go through this, you know, so they're just like, okay, rather than like, here's the deal, do you like it?  And they're like, no. So as long as we're like, you know, we're your guides, you hired us because we're experts, we're making you go through these things because you need to to get better, then we're good to go on that.  And I think you're a lot more confident on that now, Ryan, to tell people like, this is how it goes, this is what you need to go through.  This is part of your homework. Do it, you know?

18:34 - Luke Gillespie
  And maybe you don't even want to use the word sales, just call it more client facing and customer interactions, because from the onboarding calls, it seems like maybe decilency, but when they say they don't want sales, they're thinking of like a sleazy salesman cold calling, an old person trying to get them by to buy into the investment fund or something like that.  Maybe if you described it as more of, you know, more of customer facing, because I think that's what really a lot of this, what these owners are doing.  much more just customer interacting rather than sales selling them on things.

19:04 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, I just, I don't know everything about them. I don't, I don't know, uh, JJ surprised me on the roofing though.  So sometimes you guys put businesses in front of people and I'm like, whoa, but you know, they're talking about wanting to be able to lead Florida eventually and travel and they're really active and etc, etc.  like, and I'm just thinking about their personalities with mechanics and stuff like that. Like, you know, they're their own breed and energy.  um, but it's like, Hey, if you're thinking of trades businesses, like it's also good for you to like get experience looking at a trades business and seeing how that feels and seeing if that's a workforce that you can manage and work with, right?  Because whether it's an HVAC business, a farming business, a landscaping business, you're going to have to deal with that level of people.  Do it. I don't know if I don't remember.

21:02 - Luke Gillespie
  I don't think I was discussed in his onboarding calls.

21:06 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  I don't think they have pets. I know they don't have kids.

21:10 - AcquiMatch Team
  Okay, I can't remember that.

21:13 - Luke Gillespie
  also given that this is a 10 location operation, I'm sure that this owner and what he would be replacing wouldn't even be interacting with any pets.  I'm sure there's a lot of general managers and people already in place where you would probably just be replacing sort of general man, general management and oversight.  again, I haven't got another broker yet. So I'm waiting.

21:41 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Well, Luke, just a reminder, like, they're going to have to be on top of vintage street trends. going to have to be interested in it.  They're like, even if they're not interacting with the pets themselves, if they own 10 locations, they're going to have to be interested enough to go to the trade shows to think about how they're staying at the cutting edge on  how they're motivating the force to be the best pet groomers and what that actually looks like, right? So think about that because it is so important.  And now I'm blasting out content on a regular basis. Hopefully you're getting the newsletters too, but it's like if somebody's not interested in it, when  gets bad, are they gonna get out of bed and make it work?  Or are they gonna do the things necessary to innovate on it? So I can't, I don't think, I mean, I just remember gills, like no kids wants to provide for as nieces and nephews.  They love traveling. I think they love traveling so much that they don't have pets. So is a non-pet owner that has chosen not to have pets going to relate to all of his customers, which are pet owners and they're wild, those are their  kids.  So just think through that. If he didn't, if he was open to it, then he's open to it, but I just...  Sense check that when you go through it because yeah, same thing with dance moms like My friend Aaron who is like literally the worst possible person to deal with dance moms was like making offers on a dance Studio that I was like having Lindsey and Kevin look at to I was like dude like do not do this like You will kill that business because you don't understand dance moms and you're gonna  piss them off and dance moms Are gonna cancel you they will fill your business Yeah So I'm not saying no, but just keep thinking about that, right?  is this something that this person is gonna get interested in enough to read the trades man magazines and think about how they're Looking after the business even if they're not the one like interacting with and customer themselves Yeah Cool What else No, that's pretty much all I got it

24:00 - AcquiMatch Team
  As far as I'm doing this week, I just I was just looking up kill Yeah, I Said I asked him it says you're interested in all of the pets.  What's interesting to do about that?

24:16 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  He goes I believe that that's bring joy to people and I love to be a part of that Okay, okay, it love it love it so now Luke you can use that little tidbit Yep, there's a way for you to bring bring joy to people's lives That I like I follow some of the like pet groomers that like they use like non-toxic I and they like make all these like patterns and hilarious like things with the pets and stuff so like You might be able to even like grab a like piece of content like the the potholes that just end up being like rainbows Or like I saw one that was like made into a watermelon and they do like little skeletons and stuff.
  ACTION ITEM: Prep write-up on pet grooming biz for Gil. Highlight joy aspect, multi-location opps, potential for viral marketing - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/227223556?timestamp=1491.9999  It's just like hilarious but like goes viral and then ends up getting people a ton of business because they want their dog to look like that too.

25:06 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah yeah thank you so much Ryan I'll mention that when I win or if I hopefully potentially end up doing it right after that yeah thank you.

25:15 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  good okay thanks Ryan yeah again y'all like are closer on the ground but I just always want us to think about like what's the connection especially for something like that when we know like pet owners can be absolutely crazy people.

25:29 - Luke Gillespie
  That's a good point yep.

25:33 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Awesome cool how about you Ryan that your good look good to go yeah that's all I have to talk about yeah.  I was thinking about you and Andrew was talking about the cold calling and the grumpiness and like the um the like what are we so upset about you know like I could see you using those pattern interrupts like if a broker is like being  with you you know like it really hit me when he said what

26:00 - Luke Gillespie
  I was asking the questions is controlling the conversation, so I realized instead I should get them to talk once they're mad instead of selling them on us, I should be like, okay, what are you concerned about?  Let's address that. And yeah, I really like when he said that. I told this right and Andrew just drops these wisdom bombs in the buyer's clubs and minds.  He's so smart. He's so wise. I look at him as like, even though I don't think he's that old, he has toddlers, but he seems like a very like elderly man.

26:29 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, he's one of my favorites. I really want us to find him something.

26:33 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah. Yeah. Right. I are planning on talking tomorrow about getting planning strategy on him.

26:45 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Do we need to get people  running around his town and t-shirts like, sell me your business?

26:50 - Luke Gillespie
  Like, what do we need to  do? want, I want to do right by Andrew. Yeah. Uh, And, and.

27:00 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  I really like, I mean, I love all of our clients, but him in particular, like you said, it's like, he's going to be an amazing business owner.  Like, I see it, you know, yeah, don't know, I guess, I thought OKC was a bigger city, but, um, are any of those leads from the Facebook guy?

27:29 - AcquiMatch Team
  I'm looking promising now to and we're small and the third one is just a few times not picking up.  trying to regain playing around that, though. We're trying to include the SMS and be like, hey, giving you a call today.  It's me, like, you fill up forms you want to sell your business, but we're trying to figure out, like, they may not be picking up because it's not the number.  So we can talk about new ideas. So we raise up one lead that looks based on their response. So it looks like it could be a fit, although there's no website, but I'm working on trying to make myself that's in my pipeline.  Yeah, that's okay.

28:09 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  They don't have a website though. I love those.

28:12 - AcquiMatch Team
  Sure, sure.

28:13 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Huge opportunity for a new owner. You create a website. Boom. clients and visibility.

28:21 - AcquiMatch Team
  Sure.

28:23 - Luke Gillespie
  I just gave it a quick google in Oklahoma City is the 20th largest city in the US by population.  It's it's ahead of Nashville, El Paso, Vegas, Boston, Detroit. It's ahead of Memphis. It's it's ahead of Atlanta.

28:40 - AcquiMatch Team
  That's not possible.

28:44 - Luke Gillespie
  Maybe it's not.

28:45 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Especially with as many businesses as we get from Atlanta, like what's going on in Oklahoma?

28:49 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah. don't know, maybe don't person Wikipedia though. It says my hometown is the 63 third largest and And that's probably not true.

29:06 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  I mean, . Like, could we run an event and I'll just fly out there and like host an event for business owners to learn how to sell their business or something?  I don't know. I want to figure this out. Let's talk about it tomorrow. Ryan with Anka and you guys can update me on how that's going.  We haven't heard that from Ryan, unfortunately, to get that going. So, cool. Okay. Do you want to talk through your stuff?

29:46 - AcquiMatch Team
  Yes. Okay. A, we had some agenda last week that we were, she was going to send me what she has and we're going to have a call on Wednesday.  And she did not respond to my messages, so followed up today with her. She did respond, and so we have a meeting in the morning.  So, we're two days behind, but we'd have a call schedule.

30:14 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Still moving. Okay, good.

30:20 - AcquiMatch Team
  H, we just talked about him, he's still, as I said, two weeks ago, my main concern, mostly because of the deal flow.  What me and Luke are going to talk about tomorrow is that Luke did a few write-ups for him this week, and he fed back.  His feedback was, hey, honestly, DFW is not going to really be my thing. But online business, what do say, I'm much more likely to do an online business, so that was good feedback.  Okay, so tomorrow, me and Luke can discuss mostly online and show we can get something online to take us to each of us.

31:00 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  They used to have really good stuff.

31:01 - Luke Gillespie
  felt like we had a good relationship with them. I haven't seen much recently. That's SBA pre-qualified. Everything I see just isn't qualified.

31:14 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  But like, it's not pre-qualified or it wouldn't qualify.

31:21 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah, it's not qualified. They say no. We have a sheet and it says yes or no. Sometimes it says no.  And that means they checked in and didn't qualify. And then sometimes it says to be determined and Ryan's close with the Andrew who's kind of head over there.  He says that basically means no when it says TV.

31:39 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay, so you're positive that it's just like they haven't gone through the process of SBA pre-qualification versus it will not qualify?

31:49 - AcquiMatch Team
  My understanding based off two separate calls I did with them pushing him on this was that are you running these by multiple lenders?  He said yes. I said because if you're No, there's interesting businesses. can get these to clients and we can get it looked at by lenders.  I'm getting all of these looked at by multiple lenders. it says no, I've got to climb by two lenders on it, who specializes in commerce.  Okay.

32:24 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  We're in. So we're not seeing much from them then.
  ACTION ITEM: Discuss Andrew strategy w/ Luke tmrw. Focus on online businesses, review past deals he liked - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/227223556?timestamp=1950.9999

32:33 - Luke Gillespie
  Um, I was surprised to hear that from his feedback, because we always give him online businesses and he doesn't sound very excited about it.  So this is why Ryan and I agreed we're going to talk game planning strategy tomorrow. Um, yeah, because he, I mean, I don't know, I just feel like I hear him say the same thing about every deal.  Um, He says, in a space that I'm not familiar with, it's always, he's not confident with an industry that he's not familiar with.  So I'm wondering, like, what will he be familiar with? Is it only going to be real estate? And then he says, if it's between an out-of-state deal and an online deal, nine times out of 10, I'm more interested in an online deal.  So that's, yeah, Ryan and I are planning on talking about that tomorrow.

33:29 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Ryan, when's the last time you had a call with Andrew?

33:35 - AcquiMatch Team
  Okay, sounds like a little wrong.

33:37 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay.

33:46 - Luke Gillespie
  Because maybe in a call, we might have talked to Andrew about downsizing his goals because Oklahoma, we just see really small deals.  Yeah, I see really small deals for him.

34:01 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  We're like, yeah, but I don't think we're doing. If we could say that there was no fault in our sourcing.  Then we could say that.

34:14 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah.

34:16 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  don't think we're. Experts and literally like have exhausted absolutely everything in terms of sourcing. So. Okay. The reason I was asking last time he had a call is it seems like he keeps eliminating businesses before having a conversation.  Am I right in that?

34:43 - AcquiMatch Team
  Last one that we got was pretty good. He just someone someone may offer before he kind of responded to us.  It was an online business for a million dollars. Meetings that I call about it anyway. I explained about it.  Okay, like this could be interesting, but. he also did say I'm still like not sure how this kind of stuff works.  I think the point is that he's still open, I think he's still being curious, right? He's still like well still keep sending me things.  He hasn't been like Joe, he's like nope online business should not offer me. Maybe he's saying this isn't, nah this one's not for me, but he's not saying stop sending me online businesses.  He's like send me more. So I think we just that's what I want to call tomorrow about is like let's scour online businesses and keeping it but it's little for us to make them feel like okay.

35:32 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Great, okay cool.

35:35 - AcquiMatch Team
  Okay um BH we did a write-up and on a business that he actually requested and we did a broker in-show today.  Was it today or yesterday?

35:51 - Luke Gillespie
  That was today.

35:53 - AcquiMatch Team
  Okay we did a show today. So he's going to work for the program. Yes. CM has submitted an I.O.I.  on a business. We still have not heard back. But based on the conversations with CM, he said he thinks that they liked him and he thinks that he's got a shot.  So they did not respond to the I.O.I. but they said thank you for submitting and then he sent a follow-up and he hasn't heard back.  So he made an offer that was just 10% under asking, which I thought was actually pretty good.

36:36 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  What does he keep doing I.O.I.s?

36:39 - AcquiMatch Team
  They asked for an I.O.I. and then Luke just got a write-up yesterday, new write-up.

36:52 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay.

36:53 - AcquiMatch Team
  So he also said that he really liked the one he submitted the I.O.I. on. So he said I got feedback from him.  That's cool. And he's like, yeah, I'm liking all the businesses you guys are submitting. He's like, guys, I wish I could get a little further in this process is what he said.
  ACTION ITEM: Push CM to submit LOI instead of IOI next time. Explain risks/benefits, provide LOI template - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/227223556?timestamp=2228.9999

37:09 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Stop submitting IOIs.

37:13 - AcquiMatch Team
  Okay. right. I'll be my goal to try to get him to L.O.I. Yeah.

37:20 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  If he really liked that one, he should have submitted an IOI to show you a series. know they wanted an IOI, but if he submitted an IOI, it's different, right?  They use an IOI to like  shop deals or shop offers, you know?

37:37 - AcquiMatch Team
  Sure.

37:38 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So let's push him. Next time he wants to make an IOI, I'd be like, so let's do an IOI.  What's the risk, right? the template, put it all together, do an OI instead.

37:52 - AcquiMatch Team
  Okay. We'll do.

37:54 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Cool.

37:56 - AcquiMatch Team
  Okay. Um, Gil? He made it all the way to a seller broker call, we prep a lot of questions for it, and then he found some things that he was just not comfortable moving forward with this business.  I press them on all of his complaints about it, before he was getting a little aggravated with me. He's like, I don't want this business, I'll just say, that's fine, so I'm just trying to get better at making them think about these things, not just saying no.  He had some points, was like, okay, fair enough, right, but fair enough. The main thing is that the business was a little bit better business, very dependent on the housing market, housing market had done well post 2020, now I've been declining.  We'll see the other thing, the seller was saying that yes, depending on the housing market and it's depending on interest rates.  And also we had a bad year last year because the weather was bad for building and builders weren't able to build in certain months because of snow.
  ACTION ITEM: Prep/conduct call w/ Gil re: off-market glass biz tmrw. Review opps for growth/higher SDE - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/227223556?timestamp=2342.9999  And he's like, well, I don't want to be dependent on all those things. we rolled that one out. We have an off-market second call tomorrow.  So I really like Gil wants it to be a higher SDE than it is. But I explain there's opportunities to get to that growth by the business and grow its SDE.  So we have a call about tomorrow. What kind of business is the off-market? It is a glass business glass glass replacement glass repair.  love this business.

39:47 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay. Well, if he doesn't want it, then we can do something else with it because it's off-market, right?

39:52 - AcquiMatch Team
  Yep.

39:53 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Cool. So fun fact, my grandfather owned a glass repair. for a business and my cousin swears that he was like mob adjacent.

40:03 - AcquiMatch Team
  So like the mob would go and like bust in a business owner's window and then force them to use my grandfather's glass business to replace it.  And then he had to pay them. That's classic, classic mob story.

40:15 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  My mom, my mom like, she was no, I don't know, you know, because like anything that could damage the like credibility of her family or whatever, like she  hates it.  She's like, you know, my dad used to save his friends without component.

40:30 - AcquiMatch Team
  I just thought he was making it up.

40:32 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  I'm like, yeah, but glass repairing my family.

40:44 - AcquiMatch Team
  I love glass repair. It's one of the ones that I I've listened to a couple of things. I'm always just like, this is a great business.

40:52 - Luke Gillespie
  We had a good one done. Yeah, Andrew was slow. move on and it got sold.

41:01 - AcquiMatch Team
  Oh, I remember that. Okay. I wonder if might be worth re-engaging all the deals he liked and just checking in and seeing if they're still under offer or like what status they're at.  Because he's been a client now for a couple months.

41:17 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So any of those like like that, like if it's been a little bit of time, like, you know, when when I lost my business, I checked in with the broker every month.

41:27 - AcquiMatch Team
  It took eight months for them to close. Okay, you put it a note for our call tomorrow and we discuss age about that.  Bring that up and then we'll do both topics. Okay. So that is with Gil. Moving on to JB. JB's default today.  And I just put them on all the things that you pretty much call the re-emphasize. size called Athena. So I think I got him back on the horse and he's back like, all right, you know, this is the deal that he's upset that he has to renegotiate again.  So he's just having to deal with that, but we have a plan in place.

42:25 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Nice. What about JQ?

42:31 - AcquiMatch Team
  JQ. Essentially what happened is he had a call with the seller. Everything was great. Some of the APA were good to go.  APA was sent with three adjustments that were not discussed. JQ responded, these were not discussed. They responded, we want these, we're not negotiating.  JQ not pissed off So he told me the three issues I started asking him about okay. would it take to make these work?  He's like I'm not we're not negotiating. They said we're not negotiating I'm like I get that but you're you're at the finish line here like He's like we never discussed those terms if they I was like what would take you to make you happy here?  He's like eliminate those three I'm like Probably that's not gonna happen Let's just talk about the three. Let's just talk about stuff.  What are your main concerns with these three? amendments He's like it's more of a point that they're throwing him in there without talking to me.  I'm like I get that Justin I get that but I can't go back to them with nothing Let's I get them and I get them to understand that they included this without telling you What what are you flexing  So we can throw them a bone and start a negotiation to get and so I kind of pulls those out of cast And he kept going but it's the fact that they go in there without telling me.  I said something now Let me I'm gonna have the same conversation with them I'm gonna have with you and we'll see if you guys can just get over this pump and get to the finish line And he was like okay, so he's like I appreciate that So I sketched a call with the seller for Monday.
  ACTION ITEM: Prep/conduct call w/ JQ's seller Mon. Negotiate APA terms (vehicle value, indemnification, business name use) - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/227223556?timestamp=2652.9999  I'm gonna just do the same thing I'm gonna say let's not go in with both of us. I hear him out Let's gonna make it work for you And then he's gonna tell me and then I'm gonna probably have an idea what I think will work for both of them and so I'm gonna See if I can get them all the same page.  I don't think I don't think it's dead No, it's wild.

44:50 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  He's writing you and saying like he's not agreeing to terms that we agreed to so he thinks they agreed to the terms Justin said he's never heard the terms.  There's like clearly a communication break down. And the guy's using the lawyer that like, he doesn't have a broker on his side.  And so his lawyers like, like doing his job, which is making sure that the agreement has everything that it needs to protect him.  And who knows what experience lawyer has or whatever. But like for his email, it doesn't sound, it sounds like he thinks that they've agreed to something and Justin saying no.  Justin saying it never talked about it. It's like, y'all aren't communicating well. What were the three terms?

45:40 - AcquiMatch Team
  Might be able to remember that. I'll put it up in my head. One was the asset value of the vehicles.  They had agreed that the asset value would be determined by the during the QF. and then it keeps putting $45,000 in the terms.  like, no, we agreed that it's gonna be determined at doing a Q and D. that was one. Second one was that if there's some type of lawsuit in between them after the case, whoever wins, whoever loses has to cover the fees of the other.  It's called like, that's endemic vacation. So they have an indemnification ball, but they have like an amendment to that that they already agreed upon of like excluding such and such and he's like, we never discussed that and they put it there at the very last minute, but we've had it perfect.  And then when they submit the APA, they changed it. So I asked the guests, what would it take to think this happening?  It's like. See, I'm actually a good colorful example on that. Okay, that's the second one. The third one is, this is the biggest one, which I think I can resolve this, is in the last APA, when they sent it over, they put in there, they pretty much, he can only use the owner's name, which is called Ghettoitz Landscaping, for six months.  And so, he's like, we've never discussed that. It's always been that I buy the business, I get the name, now he can throw in this last thing, I can only use the name in the third six months.  So, I actually have dealt with that many times. So, I told him, I was like, what are you  spoiling?  like, I'm not flexible, I want to find the business, want the name, I said, got it. However, he's starting this conversation, meaning he thinks of the why, he's starting to think of the liability, probably the lawyer put in his hat.  It might be a liability, but this isn't product yourself. I doubt he cares, he knows exactly it's six months, they probably just started with that.  I said, in my experience in the past, we used to say, oh, Sellers, if you have your name or your face in the business, you need to change that before you want to sell.  If you're going to try to sell it with your name and face, you need to just give away with the name and face, that's it.  And then, unless the alternative would be, if you want to negotiate that term, the minimum needs to be the multiple.  So if it's a three or multiple, then you need to agree with to a minimum of three years that they can keep your name and face the business.  So I said, would you, if I gave him those alternatives, would you be happy? He said, I'd be happy with that.  So I think I'm going to listen to what Joe says and then tell him, look, he's going to buy the business, he's concerned that he's got to change the brand in the first six months.  Are you open to any alternative? time frame. I bet Joe will be open to a turn of time frame.  And I think that's the biggest thing holding this back is that that one thing. It's frustrating.

49:17 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Justin kind of like went on his own on this and decided to go straight to APA because like he hasn't even done due diligence on the business yet.  And you're getting in the weeds on conversations of like vehicle value and stuff. like if you were under offer and doing due diligence and you'd have a valuation on the vehicles and not go into the APA, know, and it's like, it's hard to dispute it.  But to go straight to AP, like now you guys are just pulling this out as a learning for all of us when a client's like, we should go to APA.  It's like, no, like you're going to be negotiating  that you don't have the answers on like how much the vehicles are before you've actually gone through the whole process.  And it'd be paid lawyer. There is an exorbitant amount of money to do your APA before you've even done due diligence to know, like, this is a viable business, you'll be able to get funding on and et cetera, you know, so like, it's just having a bunch of arguments before you actually have the data, it doesn't make sense.

50:16 - AcquiMatch Team
  Yeah.

50:20 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So Luke, you understand, Justin, like, was it a client ended services? We brought him this, and we're supporting him, because, like, none of us would be here if it wasn't for Justin taking a chance on me, so we want to help him, but also Justin kind of goes off on his own and thinks he's got things, and it's like, dude, use us, lean on us, follow the plan, follow the , you know, oh, just go straight to APA.  It's like, don't do that. This is why you're going to spend a ton of money and time in frustration, and like, guess what?  going to have to renegotiate all this  after you get the real answers on what the vehicle is worth, and doing the QV and getting the lending terms, but they got to commit the letters.  So it was like wild, on the same day, blessing is like, we got a command and letter, it's like awesome.  then the owner is like, what other sellers do you have? what is going on? so it's like, there's, there's a communication breakdown.  Something also that I just had to do with Lindsey and Kevin, it's like, and I have to have this conversation with people a lot.  And it's like, swallow your pride. Do you want to be right? Or do you want to get a deal done?  Yeah, they should have talked to you like, okay, it's happened. What are you going to  do about it? Are you going to believe or the point and get them to admit that they were wrong?

51:38 - AcquiMatch Team
  Or do you just want to get the deal done and buy the business? I love that. Yeah.

51:45 - Luke Gillespie
  Especially for Joe, after like how many deals he's missed on and how long he's been with us and he's still not just like, I don't know if the right word to say, it's not just like, so excited about this H back company.

52:00 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  But yeah. In this scenario, Justin's letting his ego get ahead of getting, you know, like you just spend a ton of money and time on the steel and your ego is getting in the way.  You want to be right, you want them to admit that they should have told you these things. The seller doesn't have a broker, he's using a wire, he's trying to protect him, like that is  normal.  Like this is normal, right? okay, boo-hoo, yeah, they probably should have brought up the terms, they put it in the thing and then thought you'd negotiate and talk through it.  Like, so you can get them to admit, they were wrong, which is unlikely to happen because it's a bunch of men and their egos at this stage, or you just get over it, you know?  And like, Lindsay and Kevin are now having to pay the owner of their first business money that they do not owe her.  Like, she doesn't understand working capital at all, thinks she's owed bunch of money, she's not, and she can't even explain her own books or do anything, but she's getting more involved in the business, she's pulling  the clients away from like Kevin and Lizzie. So she's establishing like relationships with them, right? And their team, their employees are like, you need to protect us from her.  We do not want to interact with this. So their whole business is at risk because of this one woman, this owner, who's toxic, right?  And it's like, okay, well, you could be right and have her admit that she doesn't understand working capital and that she signed an agreement, you don't owe or anything.  But what is that going to solve? know, your age, she's not going to, she's a narcissist, she's not ever going to admit she's wrong.  Like I picked that up the first five seconds that I talked to her, you know, narcissists are great business owners because they're charismatic and get people involved, but they're not going to, they're not going to admit they're wrong.  So you can spend all this time energy, frustration, et cetera, put your business at risk, she's going to get more in the weeds with this client that's your second highest  revenue, or you  Sitting in a lot, let's  go now.

55:02 - Luke Gillespie
  Okay, cool.

55:04 - AcquiMatch Team
  And we'll figure out the trust of the JQ things. I'm confident.

55:09 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  You sound like you got a really good plan, but I was just giving you some more insight. take the ego out of it.

55:14 - AcquiMatch Team
  Like, do you want to be right? you want to get this business?

55:17 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  okay, yeah, they should have kind of would have whatever, like, the big thing is the brand. we get that, you did the right thing.  You're negotiating it the right way. So, well done. Thanks for jumping in there. That'll be a huge win for us.  Our brand, our business, our very first client, know, our origin story. Like, , it's a good one to spend some time on.  I appreciate you doing that. So, well done, YouTube.

55:44 - AcquiMatch Team
  Good stuff's happening. Absolutely. you guys tomorrow. Yep. Bye.
