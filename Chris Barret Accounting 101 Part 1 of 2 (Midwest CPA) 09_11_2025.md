# AcquiMatch Buyers Club 09/11/2025

[00:00:00] 

**Athena:** Hi, everyone. Welcome. Hey, Lisa. Hey Polly. Nice to see you. Awesome. Justin's here. Steve's here. Super excited to see you all. Excited for today's conversation as well. Um. I am really excited to reintroduce and introduce, uh, Chris Barrett. Uh, he was one of our very first buyers club, uh, uh, like guests that we had when we started this series.

I think it was November last year. Um, he's worked on, uh, transactions for our clients before. Um, has a, a lot of really great experience specifically with, um, acquiring businesses, QV and business accounting. Um, him and his team do exceptional work, and also I really like Chris's style and how he educates and kind of brings you on that journey of understanding the financial side [00:01:00] of things when you're looking at transactions.

So, really excited to have Chris back. Um, the, the brief really was like, Hey, can we go through some one-on-one stuff? Um, because like honestly, as much as I read financial statements, I, there's never, uh, never something. You can't learn to look at it a different way. So why not have someone that looks at 'em day in, day out, kind of explain to us, um, what we should be looking at and what we see in there.

So, um, Chris has done, I think, two previous episodes on QV and, um, some diligence that you could do pre LOI, so absolutely worth checking those out again, um, in the future. Um, but in the meantime, Chris. Welcome. Um, thank you so much for being here and sharing today. Um, and please do, do yourself the service of introducing yourself properly.

I never try to give people's backgrounds. I know. I'll butcher it. 

**Chris:** Yeah, yeah. No, thanks for having me back. So it's exciting to, uh, connect [00:02:00] everybody again and, um, yeah. So I'm Chris Barrett. Uh, I run Midwest CPA. We're a accounting firm, niched in working with acquisition entrepreneurs. So we've done hundreds of quality earnings engagements, uh, helping buyers with due diligence and then post-closing we have a like, uh, over a hundred clients.

So we worked with post-closing the, after we bought their business with bookkeeping tax advisory type work as well. 

**Athena:** So. Cool. Yeah. And let me do a quick plug for next week. So this is part one of two. Today is gonna be, uh, financial statement basics, but then next week Chris is gonna come back and talk about accounting for business owners, the different.

Types what you should be looking for, et cetera. So like once you acquire the business, then what does accounting look like? And I think it will help you guys also get an understanding of what the current owners have to look at for accounting, um, from their side. So part one of two today. So Chris will be back here next week also.

Um, so yes. Okay, Chris, now I won't interrupt. You should have, uh, sharing [00:03:00] access. Um, as always we'll record this and put it on your, uh, alls platform so you can review this later. Um, Chris, over to you. 

**Chris:** All right, thank you. Let me see if I can share properly. Tell me if that looks right to you guys. 

**Athena:** Yep. It's coming through.

It's not full screen, but we can see, it looks like it might be landscape a little bit. 

**Chris:** I think I have a, it's probably my giant monitor that screws up. I could try this instead. Is this better? It's just the slide thing. It's not as pretty, but it's the job done. Um, 

**Athena:** yeah, we can see it. That, that, that is a little bit bigger than the other one, so that works.

**Chris:** Okay. Apologize for that. Okay. Um, yeah, so Taylor, we're gonna talking about financial statements 1 0 1. Um, feel free if you guys got questions, you know, either same for the end or you want, or you can, uh, if you wanna write something in the chat, I'm happy to. Answer stuff as, as it popped in your head too.

Um, [00:04:00] no worries there. Uh, so agenda for today. Uh, already shared myself a little bit, but, uh, from there we'll be talking about financial statements, why they matter. We'll go through the three main financial statements, income statement, balance sheet, statement of cash flows, what they are, what you should be looking for there.

Um, and also just walk through a couple examples of each. Um, and then again, things to look out for as you are analyzing them, especially looking at deals, uh, you know, things that in SNA sim and they should probably jump out to you pretty quickly. Um, and you'll, as you get more reps doing that stuff, you'll, you'll learn to be able to recognize potential flags or potential items worth asking the broker or seller more questions on, um, pretty quickly.

And then, uh, yeah, open up for questions. So, uh, so like I said, I'm Chris Barrett. Uh, I started my firm about three years ago. Uh, we're a team of 12 now. Um, we work, uh, all in ETA, so all our clients, just about our business buyers, assisting them with, uh, due [00:05:00] diligence, quality of earnings analysis, pre-acquisition, and then post-closing, ongoing bookkeeping tax advisory type work.

Just to get started. So why, why do financial statements matter at all? Um, you know, at, at the end of the day, they tell a story of the business. And when you're buying a company or you're analyzing a company, uh, there's probably lots of stories they're getting told, right? The broker's telling you one thing, the buyer's telling, or the, uh, the seller's telling you something else.

And then, uh, you know, you might have your own thoughts about the business and at the end of the day, right, it'll has to tie back to what you're actually seeing and the hard data in the financials. Uh, where's the money coming in? Uh, what's driving revenue? What's driving operating expenses in that business?

And what's. Actually, um, coming down to the ebitda, the company you're buying, it all ties back to those actual numbers. Um, so it's gonna help you validate what you're hearing from, from people in the deal. It's also gonna help you reveal potential risk factors or red flags of that company. So [00:06:00] even if things are tying out or at these small businesses, they all problems.

They might have issues with their working capital, it might take them a long time to get paid. Uh, you might be finding that they keep too much inventory on hand, or you might find that, uh, they're overstaffed or that they're understaffed or lots of different things can start to jump out to you. Uh, so the better you, you're able to analyze those financials, the more you're able to understand that story and see potential risks and potential areas where you might be able to improve that company.

Um, after closing. It's also gonna be used to support how you value the company. Um, right? More, more red flags, more risk factors, right? Usually lower valuation versus, uh, right, the opposite. Also true less, less red flags, less risk factors, uh, usually are gonna put a higher multiple in that business. Um, and then planning your operations post closing too.

So if you're able to analyze the financials well and really understand, you know, when we do [00:07:00] a QOV, we're going top to bottom. We wanna understand every line item on that P and l, you know, what's in office expenses, you know, what, what is it like, okay, it's a bunch of Amazon purchases. What are they actually buying?

Like, what is it that's being spent here to drive earnings in this company? Like you wanna know top to bottom what's, what's in each of those categories. And then use that to drive how you're gonna be running the business post-closing and being able to understand financial as well's gonna allow you to do that.

Now there's three main financial statements. There is the income statement, there's the balance sheet and the statement of cash flows. And as you get more familiar with 'em, you will understand that each of them answers a very specific question for you as, uh, as you do your analysis on the company, and they also talk to each other.

So it's very important that you never are just looking at the income statement, right? A lot of business owners run their businesses only looking at the income statement. If they even are doing that, [00:08:00] someone just run outta their bank account. But if they're, you know, in step two of, uh, of finance and small business, they might be just looking at their income statement, but they're missing a whole.

Huge part of the story by not looking at their balance sheet and not looking at their statement of cash flow is because all three of those statements do talk together. And, uh, and, and if you don't understand all three of 'em, you really don't understand the company. You really don't under understanding a small portion of, uh, of, of the story here.

So first we're gonna talk about the income statement. Um, the income statement seeks to answer one main question. It's, uh, how profitable is this business at the end of the day? That's what it all, all comes back to. Um, that's what you go to income statement to find out is how profitable is this particular company?

And when you look at an income statement, we're gonna look at one in the second. It is broken down into a few different sections. So at the top of the income statement, you'll see all the money that comes into this, all the revenue from operating activities. So you're gonna see the sales of products and services.[00:09:00] 

All the money that comes in there is gonna be coming up into revenue. Then the first expense category that you're gonna see. Is cost of good sold. So this is gonna be costs that are direct, directly, directly related to, uh, generating that revenue. So the direct labor, the direct materials, maybe subcontractors on a certain project, all that that's tied directly to that revenue is gonna be showing up in that cost of good sold so that you can see the gross profit margin.

That is if I sell something, if I sell a hundred dollars worth of services today, I know that in order to fund the rest of my company, right, all my fixed expenses, I know that I'm gonna have 40 bucks. Right. And if, if you didn't break it out that way, the reason income statement is broken out that way is that if it wasn't broken out that way, you'd really have no idea if I went and sold a hundred bucks, how much.

Is actually going into my pocket to then spend on the fixed expenses of my business [00:10:00] and the ongoing operating expenses. So you wanna see them separately. So the income statement is broken out that way. When you're analyzing a business, and especially the small business that you look at, you're gonna see very frequently.

Unfortunately, uh, the business owner didn't break those out. There's so frequently you'll see just direct labor is down in opex and you know, materials are down in opex and it's not properly split out. So that is something you want to do in your diligence. When you're looking at the companies, you, it's really important to understand the gross margin of the company.

Like if, if you know nothing else, when you're running your business, you need to know your gross margin. Um, because you need to know if I sell a hundred bucks, how much, how much am I actually keeping of that? Um, so when you're doing your analysis, you do want to dive into that deeper to understand are this, this really being reported to me properly?

After the gross profit, you have all your, your operating expenses. So that's gonna be things like your, your, uh, your overhead wages, your rent, your marketing [00:11:00] expenses, your sales expenses, utilities, things like that are gonna be, are be falling into the opex and that gets you down to your operating profit.

Uh, operating profit usually should be pretty close to what, what your EBITDA is. There's sometimes some adjustments that come into there. Um, but generally it should be relatively close to ebitda. Um, below that, below operating profit, you'll see other income expenses, C lll, c interest depreciation, one time, uh, items occasionally go in there as well.

Um, and then below that will be your net income. Um, and we'll go through an example of what an income statement looks like in in one second here. But, so what you're gonna be looking out for when you are doing your analysis of, uh, of an income statement is first you wanna look at, um. Year over year, month over month, what, uh, is anything very significant changed in the company?

Um, so if in one year, for example, you see [00:12:00] that gross margins are consistently 40%, but then in the next year you see that there's 60%, that should immediately spark in your mind that you need to ask a question of why has this changed so dramatically? Um, and it could be bad accounting, right? It could be that they've mismatched their revenue and expenses, or it could be that something materially different has happened in the business.

Like maybe they updated their price book and they now finally, after not increasing their prices for 15 years, they finally increased them. And, and it is something that the story matches the, the numbers, um, properly. Another thing you wanna look for is, is there any large variances from what you'd expect?

Uh, industry standards. So as you, especially if you're looking at a particular industry to buy in, you're gonna start to see trends that most companies have very similar, uh, and similar industries. They'll have similar, um, similar margins, uh, [00:13:00] similar EBITDA margins, similar gross profit margins. Um, so like I had a client.

Not too long ago, they were looking at an HVAC company to purchase and the EBITDA margin that was reported was 45%. And I said, if they're getting 45% as the greatest HVAC company in the country right now, like it is not very feasible. That's, that's real. Um, it's much more common maybe in the 15 to 20%. Um, so it, it, it lets you know that there's gotta be more things you dig into and you can get better and faster at that as you, uh, you understand what to look for in the income statement.

Here's a quick example. I actually think I'm gonna flip my screen. I'm gonna, I have this same, uh, same thing up in Excel, so I'm gonna flip my screen to my Excel file if that's alright. 

**Athena:** While you're switching screen. Chris, a question that came through from Lisa was, what counts as direct labor versus indirect labor?

IE what goes in cogs versus payroll? 

**Chris:** Really good [00:14:00] question. So when we're thinking about how we split that up, it's really, is this expense directly related to the, the revenue that's being generated? So if we think about, um, like, like you'll just use an HVAC example, since a lot of people are buying that industry, uh, like the techs, the people out in the field that are.

Touching the work that is, that is directly related to the revenue that's coming in. They're gonna be considered direct labor. While if you have people that are, um, more in your back office, right? Like someone that's doing, maybe you have an admin or someone that who the phone or does the bookkeeping thing, or you have a sales person, right?

They're doing work every day, right? And that, that work might be somewhat related to the, to the revenue that comes in, but they're not directly touching that, that work that does, that's, uh, connected with the revenue every day. So they would fall into operating expenses. That's kind of the way that you can, you can split up and every once in a while you'll get into [00:15:00] some that are, um, like on the fringes, right?

Like maybe you have a manager that sometimes they're in the field, sometimes they're back doing some more managerial activities, and then it's. You know, you could, you could split their time up and maybe that's not really material enough where it matters to do that. And maybe you just put them in one bucket and understand, um, you know, have put some thought into, you know, where you're gonna put them if they are someone that kind of gets on the fringes.

'cause occasionally we'll have someone that's a bit split where some of their time is maybe doing sales and some of that time is in the field. So does that help? 

**Athena:** Yep. We got a thumbs up from Lisa, so it looks like question answered. Thank you. 

**Chris:** Awesome. Uh, okay, great. So here's just an example of an income statement.

It says, you can hear, see up top here we have the revenue and we have, uh, below that we have cost to get sold and we have gross profit. And something I always like to do whenever I'm like, even if I'm just looking at the financials on an annual basis, I would [00:16:00] always wanna eventually do on a monthly basis, but just to start looking at an annual basis, I wanna see.

What are our margins looking like on a year over year basis for really each category of the p and l? But the first one I wanna look at is gross profit. So over here we have, as a percentage of revenue, um, what is our, our gross profit. So it's 52%, 51%, 56%, 53%. So in this case, it's worth asking the question, okay, you're down to 52% in, in 2022.

Uh, what, what drove your margins to increase? And you could see alongside that, we also see that revenue increased, uh, pretty dramatically. This example, I believe this was a COVID type, uh, related, I can totally remember this deal is so long ago. Um, but I believe there was some sort of COVID slump that that resulted in that, that being down.

But, so you want to be able to connect that story and it should, should jump out to you right away that, okay, there's been a, a pretty significant change in this company between 22 and 24. Um, what is driven that? And [00:17:00] you wanna do that for each category. So, um. On top of that, you can see that wages, for example, in 2020, uh, two or 27% of revenue while in the, uh, in 2024, only 21% of revenue.

And this is something worth asking the question on, maybe that's because, uh, they just had a lot of back, back office staff, and that back office staff could, uh, could really work through more revenue. And then once they did increase, uh, increase their revenue, it just became a lower percentage. Or maybe you'll find that, uh, in some cases they were doing things improperly.

Maybe they're putting all their wages down here, but subcontractors were up in cogs. Once they switched from having subcontractors to moving up more of an in-house, that's what caused the flip flop and it was just like a categorization issue. Um, so it, those are the types of things you wanna be looking [00:18:00] at is year over year, month over month, what's jumping out as a significant change.

And I'll flip over here since I got this open. We always do this on a monthly basis too. So we'll do this analysis to look at, um, in any given month, you know, how, what, what's, what's changed for this month versus other months. So you can see here this cost a good sold category. It became a positive number and sometimes you'll see this, you'll like, all of a sudden the expenses flips the other direction.

Maybe they got some sort of credit or they categorize something wrong. So it's always just a really good idea to look at this in a detailed view on a monthly basis to see what months are jumping out to you as potentially, um. Errors or just things you need to understand more about the company and how they do things.

I just was doing a deal the other day where, uh, um, someone was buying a, a, uh, a company that's a, uh, I'm trying not [00:19:00] to give too much away. It was a TV station essentially in the area where that TV station was. Had a sports team that did very well recently. And because, uh, that TV station outta a sports team in the area did very well recently, their ad revenue all of a sudden spiked like out of the, out the gym, right?

And so we're asking, Hey, why did revenue come up so much? Like, oh, okay. That, that makes sense. There's always a story behind why these numbers change on a month to month or year to year basis. So it's, as you look at them more, you'll get a more keen eye to see what's changing. Alright. Um, any questions on income statement before I jump to balance sheet?

Otherwise, this will, uh. 

**Athena:** I had just one question. Yeah. Kristen, you were talking about the things to look out for and you said deviations from industry standards. Do you have like a place that, that you would recommend for folks to check, like where they can find margin standards or is that kind of insider knowledge that you have access to these databases?

**Chris:** Yeah. Um, [00:20:00] I used to subscribe to one, it is called, uh, vertical iq. Mm-hmm. Um, it was, uh, it was pretty cheap. There's some of that are really expensive. I use that one because they're relatively cheap. Um, and it was good. It gave me some decent insights at this point. Now, like we, we have kind of our own database of, uh, like hundreds of deals.

So we, you know, I didn't find too much use in it after a while. Um, but yeah, there, there's plenty out there. I think that one was only like a hundred bucks a month or something. So if you do want one, they, uh, they gave some like nice like reports and good questions to ask about those companies and, uh, in industry.

Analysis and stuff like that. So like you might be, wanna look into or others similar to it. Awesome. Thank you.

Uh, put back here.

Okay. All right. Next we're gonna talk about the balance sheet. [00:21:00] So the balance sheet seeks to answer, uh, one main question, which is what does the business own and what does it owe? Um, so when you look at a balance sheet, it's broken down into three categories. It's, uh, assets, liabilities, and equity, and underneath assets, or excuse me, a assets liability, equity.

And then underneath assets and liabilities, uh, you're gonna see, usually broken down two ways. You're gonna have current assets, and then you're gonna have, uh, non-current assets, usually like fixed assets, equipment, vehicles, buildings, things like that. And the liabilities. You're gonna see a similar breakdown between current liabilities and, uh, long-term liabilities, loans, payables that are due more than 12 months from now.

And then the current liabilities are things that are due within 12 months, similar on the asset side. Current assets are, are, uh, items that are, um, can be turned into cash within 12 months. Um. We'll get [00:22:00] into it looking at a balance sheet in a second. But some of the things that I wanna be looking at in particular when I'm analyzing a balance sheet sheet is, um, can the current assets cover the current liabilities?

So if someone, uh, if I, if someone comes on to their new client and they need help with their business, maybe they're having some cashflow issues, first thing I'm gonna look at is how healthy is this business? Do they have enough cash and short-term, uh, current assets like receivables that can quickly hopefully be turned into cash to cover their short-term liability?

So the, the bills that they have due within the next 12 months, do they have enough to cover that? And there's some, some companies that they don't. And if they don't, that means that that company either needs to change something quickly, they need to get a loan in, they need to get an investment in, or they need to find some way to generate cash quick, more quickly in order to cover their short-term debts.

What all that turns into when you're looking at buying a business is essentially that's a measure of their working capital. The working [00:23:00] capital is their current assets minus their current liabilities. And with a transaction, because a business owner can basically keep as much cash on their books as they want, right?

If you're buying a business, it's been around for 15 years, it hasn't had debt on it in 10, right? They might just keep a boatload of cash on their books. So when you're doing an analysis of it, it's sometimes helpful to look at the current assets by stripping out the cash and just looking at the operating current assets of accounts receivable, inventory, accounts payable, and then any deferred revenue and expenses.

And we'll dive into that a little bit more in a second. 'cause working capital is such a big issue. Another thing I'm gonna look at on the balance sheet is they're CapEx. So on that fixed assets category, how much are they spending on fixed assets each year? Um, if you're buying a business that's, um. Let's say it's a manufacturing facility right there, is that that business might have one number for ebitda.

It might have a million bucks in EBITDA a year, [00:24:00] but in order to sustain the equipment that generates that million dollars of ebitda, that business might have to invest 200 grand a year into equipment, right? That that's not an unreasonable thing to, to see happen. So you, you do wanna understand, is this a CapEx heavy business, um, that's gonna require you to, um, to have money set aside out of your, your EBITDA to put into, uh, to reinvest into to capital expenditures.

Another thing to look at is the use of loans. Uh, so it's a pretty good indicator that a business doesn't have a great cash flow if you're gonna buy it. 'cause you, if you see that they have a line of credit they're always having to draw on, there's always maxed out, right? Like, whatever their EBITDA says, you know, cash is king.

And if, if they can't meet their, their, uh, payments each month to their vendors because, and they have to keep borrowing from their line of credit in order to do that, that might be an indicator that their cashflow is, is, is not very [00:25:00] stable. It could just be seasonality, but, you know, it is something worth asking more questions on and looking into.

Um, also distribution and contribution is something I look at. So, uh, in the equity section of the balance sheet, you're gonna see, um, distributions to the ownership and then contributions from the ownership. And if you see that the owner is always having to contribute money to the business, some order to the loan, so they're always having to put money in, in order to make payroll.

Right. That's probably a pretty good indicator of that. The business doesn't have very strong cash flow on the other side in the distributions. You kind of wanna know what the distributions are, and I'll tell you why is that in, in diligence? What we found before is, um, sometimes there's a distributions, but they're really distributions and then they pay people in cash.

So you want to know that those are real distributions to the ownership. Um, but as assuming they are a real distribution, that they're actually profit coming out, it's actually a good indicator, right? If the owner is writing themselves a check every Christmas for $500,000 plus [00:26:00] they ran payroll on W2 to themselves for another 500 grand.

Like, that gives you some comfort that okay, this, this business really is making cash and that owner's really able to take that cash and just use it wherever they want personally versus having to continue to, to leave it in the company, um, in order to sustain operations. Um, I'm gonna flip back again.

Apologize for the, uh, the whiplash. I am gonna flip over to. That sheet again, and we will, uh, did I close it? Yeah, I'll pull this up.

Um, open that, open a balance sheet. So similar when I'm looking at a balance sheet, uh, again, I wanna look at, uh, year over year, month or month, what has changed in this particular company. Um, so in this business, it doesn't have any inventory, but something I would wanna look at on inventory is, um, how old is that inventory?

And they've been sitting out there for a very long time. And one of the ways that you can, [00:27:00] uh, you can analyze that is if this business, let's say they spend, um, a million dollars a year on materials, right? And they have $250,000 of inventory on hand. That means they have about a quarter of the year worth of inventory on hand.

So they have. 90 days essentially, right? They can not buy any inventory today, and for the next 90 days, they could be able to fund all their inventory needs for that business. Doing that calculation on the company can be really insightful for you because, uh, it's a good indicator that maybe they have either too much or too little inventory.

If it's a, uh, uh, actually we just had this deal earlier this week. Someone was buying an HVAC company, and this hvac uh, company had on their inventory, on their balance sheet had about a hundred days worth of inventory on hand. No HVAC company needs to keep a hundred days of inventory at hand. And when we dug in deeper, we [00:28:00] found that most of the inventory wasn't real.

It was obsolete. Uh, it was just unnecessary, um, for them to be leaving that on their balance sheet. And it was kind of, kind of bogus. Um, so that's something to look at for the health of the company. Do they, do they keep too much inventory? Do they keep too little? Um, and is is what's sitting on the balance sheet legitimate?

Sometimes when you'll, I'm sure you've seen this before, you've started looking at sims, you'll see the inventory balance is the exact same number every single month and maybe for years and years on end. Uh, it's 'cause a lot of these small businesses don't do a good job of tracking their inventory on a monthly basis.

So that might trigger a question for you. If you see that the inventory never changes, you might wanna ask, you know, what is your inventory process like? How much do you keep on hand? And to bring it all back to how this connects to the, the income statement, occasionally what you'll find is their inventory balance is not accurate in their books, uh, on their balance sheet.

And on the other hand, if you see [00:29:00] their gross margin swinging up and down, it might be because, uh, they're not doing inventory right. Maybe every single month. Their inventory balance is always increasing. Then their cost of goods sold is a very low number every single month. Well, that means that they're probably just putting all the materials they're buying and using.

They're just throwing 'em on their balance sheet, which is making their company look way more profitable than it really is. So it's a good thing to know how these, these statements talk to each other. 'cause when you find something that's, that piques your interest on one statement, the answer to that question might be on the other one.

Right? So if you were looking at the income statement and you see that gross margins don't make any sense, and you see that it's materials that's all sudden super low, and then you see inventory on the balance sheet just keeps increasing, right? You know, those two are talking and maybe you can answer your own question a little bit.

Similar to knowing how much inventory you have on hand, you also wanna know how much accounts receivable, uh, is, is on hand and whether that accounts receivable is legitimate, [00:30:00] right? So looking at ar aging report and seeing is everything over 90 and it's just been sitting out there forever and they're not doing a good job of, of keeping track of it.

Uh, or is it, is it all current? Also, that same calculation that we did for how much, uh, how many days of inventory they have on hand, you wanna look at the same calculation for how many days of accounts receivable do they have on hand. So, you know, on average when I send out an invoice, how long is that gonna take me to get paid?

Do I get paid in 15 days if I send out an invoice? Or do I get paid 90 days when I send out an invoice? Because that's a big, uh, big component of, of the cash flow and, and how cash is gonna move in. So here we got all our, all our assets, we have our current assets, and then our fixed assets. And then down here we have our accounts payable.

Um, and then all of our, uh, um, all of our fixed, uh, our fixed, fixed, excuse me, all of our long-term liabilities, [00:31:00] um, on accounts payable, the same calculation and analysis that we did of inventory and receivables of how long does it take for me to, to get paid or how many days of of inventory I have on hand.

I also wanna look at how many days does it take from me on average to pay people. A lot of times you'll see that with these small businesses, they might not do a very good job of managing their payables. They might get an invoice and then pay it right away, and that might be an opportunity for you. As a buyer for once you've closed in this business, you can enhance that process, pay the invoice on the actual due date 30 days later, which can then greatly increase the cash flow of, uh, of the business that you have.

If, if, if the, uh, it takes you 30 days to get paid from someone else and you have the ability to pay your vendors in 30 days, right? That, that can even out your cashflow really well. You get paid in 30 days, you pay other people in 30 days. But if the business owner was running it as, I'm just gonna pay it as soon as it comes in, right?

And it takes you 30 days to get paid and you're paying people in [00:32:00] zero or five, right? Your cashflow is significantly worse. And then down below here we have our equity section, um, with the contributed capital, and you're gonna see all the distributions and everything coming up there. Any questions on balance sheet before I jump into statement of cash flows?

**Lisa:** You um, got a question. Oh, sorry. 

**Athena:** Um. Real quick, Lisa, I was just gonna have Chris dig a little bit more into the equity, um, retained equity. Yeah. How that goes over. Can you just explain what, what that means on the balance sheet? 

**Chris:** Yeah. The retained earnings is all of the earnings of the business that are still in there.

So if a business, uh, if you contributed a hundred grand to a company, you start it and then that business earns, uh, a million dollars in that year, and then you don't take any of that money out. That million bucks is gonna be in year two, the retained earnings. From, uh, from that company. [00:33:00] Um, and then the next year, if you make another million dollars, but you distribute a portion of that, um, uh, a portion of that money, maybe you distribute, uh, $500,000.

Now your retainer went up to 2 million 'cause you made two years of a million dollars million, but then you took out 500. So now there's only 1.5 million that's retained in the business. Um, and that's what that retained earnings is, is measuring for you. Does that make sense? 

**Athena:** Thanks Chris. And Lisa, if you wanna go ahead and ask your question too.

**Lisa:** Yeah, it was actually along the same lines. Um, so when looking at the balance sheet, um. I'm trying to kind of process what you just said and also think about, um, my question. So looking at that retained earnings, is there an easy, like I see it's kind of going up and down month to month, um, as you read across the road there.

So that's [00:34:00] not just distributions and contributions, but there's another piece in there as well that I didn't quite catch. So what I was looking for is like if the number in that line goes down, that means the owner took a distribution. Is that correct? 

**Chris:** Uh, so, 

**Lisa:** or it's not quite that simple. 

**Chris:** I might have misleading you a little bit by sh showing this summarized view, so I might jump over to this view in a little more detail.

So, um, the net income will become retained earnings at the end of the year. So after December 31st, you close out retained earnings as just a normal accounting process, a net income on the balance sheet. So come December, the net income that's on the balance sheet will go to zero, and that whatever balance say is 500 grand and net income, that 500 grand will then go to retained earnings.

So you start January 1st with [00:35:00] $0 in net income on your balance sheet. Okay. Does that that part make sense? Then the next year, right? All the ups and downs, depending on what your net income does accumulated throughout the, throughout the year, that's gonna go up and down. And then the next year you'll clear out that net income.

The reason that this retained earnings is changing month to month is because the way that that model was built was that both net income and e retain earnings on a monthly basis were routing to the same category. So it's slightly misleading and that really should be done on an annual basis. But this model is just doing it on a monthly basis.

Uh, so the reason that you saw retain earnings go down was just if net income was negative that month, um, if you saw it go up, but retained s in real, like accounting it, it shouldn't change. But once a year, it changes. On the very end of the year, you close out net income to retained earnings and you'll [00:36:00] also close out distributions and contributions.

Um, as, as well, because you wanna see, when you run the balance sheet on ju in July, you wanna see, okay, there's 500 grand in distributions. You wanna know that that 500 grand distributions was actually for the year that you're looking at, not the accumulation of the last 10 years that have distributed, uh, $500,000.

So that's why you close it out in year end. So that, that makes a ton of sense when you're looking at the balance sheet, you know exactly what you're looking at. Does that make sense? Does that clear that? 

**Lisa:** Yes. Thank you. And I see, I see on this particular balance sheet that there's actually a line for distributions.

Um mm-hmm. That's nice to have there. I've, I've seen some that, certainly I've suspected that the owner's taking distributions, but there's no line item calling out whether or not they're doing that. So, um, thank you. 

**Chris:** Yeah, absolutely. [00:37:00] And something, uh, something I don't think enough buyers, uh, ask about or, you know, even know to request, and we always do it in our, our process, but, um, there's a, there's another financial statement called the general ledger.

Uh, it's not nearly as pretty to look at if you don't know what you're looking at as an income statement and a balance sheet and the statement cash flows. But essentially what a general ledger is, is it's a, a list of all of the transactions that are being used to create the income statement and the balance sheet and the statement of cash flows.

Um, so that's another good report to grab because you'll actually see the detail behind it. So if they just have one line item for equity, kind of like, like what that first example I showed where it was just all summarizing the one, when you get the general ledger, you're gonna see the, the full detail of each transaction that makes up those changes and those balances every month.

There's another good thing to ask for. Um, so you, so you know. If what they're sending you doesn't immediately make sense. You kind of [00:38:00] answer your own question by seeing the detail.

All right. Uh, statement of cash flows. So statement of cash flows, seeks to answer the question, where did the cash come from and then where did it go? Um, the statement cash flows will be broken down into three main sections. Uh, the three sections are operating activities, investing activities, and then financing activities.

So the operating activities are gonna be, uh, all the core operations of the business. Uh, the investing activities are gonna be when money went out, maybe to purchase assets in the company, or maybe there's equipment that was sold, um, or maybe there's, uh, investment in other business or something like that.

That's all gonna show up in investing activities. And then financing activities is gonna be. Uh, cash coming in or coming out from the owners of the [00:39:00] company, right? So, uh, like equity investment, um, or taking out debt or paying down debt, uh, is gonna show up in financing activities. All three of those, uh, those sections will sum up to show the net change in cash.

So the start of the, the cash balance at the start of the month, and then the cash balance at the end of the month. So you can see here, again, all these statements are connected, so that cash balance on the balance sheet, it ties back to, uh, to the statement of cash flows, which shows the story of, all right, well, if you look at the balance sheet, might just see, and my cash was a hundred grand this month, and it's 125 grand next month.

Why did it change so much? Maybe you'll see that your cash balance went up. By $25,000. But then you look at your income statement and the profitability was negative, right? That can happen. Um, and the statement of cash flows will tell the story of how that happens. And I'm gonna jump right [00:40:00] into an example of that.

Um, I'm gonna go back to that sheet Where're, just look it up.

So here we go. We have statement cash flows right here. So what the statement cash flows is seeking to do is it's reconciling, uh, the cash at the beginning of the period, the change in the cash, and then the cash at the end of the period. And so it starts with net income. So in this case, we had negative net income in July of 61,000.

Now. That, that doesn't necessarily mean that we had $61,000 negative cash in that particular month because you might send out an invoice, right? That's gonna be booked as revenue. So you may send out an invoice for a hundred thousand dollars, and that's gonna be booked as revenue in this month. So it's gonna increase your net income.

However, maybe you don't get paid on an invoice until next month, so it didn't actually increase your cash position at all. And [00:41:00] so what the statement of cash flows is doing is bridging those differences, those types of differences. That sometimes will happen with payables too. Maybe you, uh, you have a invoice that you incurred this month, but you didn't actually pay it until next month.

Um, maybe you rang up a credit card balance right, where you incurred that expense today, but then you're paying your credit card at the end of the month and that that's on the 15th of, of next month. Um, or maybe you have some non-cash expenses, so maybe including that debt income figure was. $10,000 of depreciation, which right, that's not actually cash leave in your pocket.

So this section here, the cash from operations is gonna take all those different items, uh, those changes on the balance sheet of that AR and ap, and it's gonna reconcile the net income to how much cash actually went into your pocket. So here we could see, we started with negative $61,000. So our profitability that month was negative 61 grand, but then we [00:42:00] received on a ton of invoices, must have sent a ton of invoices.

Last month we received $556,000, um, in cash. So our AR balance went down because we had previously sent out invoices, but then this month we just happened to collect on those invoices. We recognized the revenue last month or two months ago, but we had collected on them today. So our cash balance went up.

Uh. Similar accounts payable. In this case, it's a positive number, so it's increasing our cash position. That means that our net income was lower by 131 grand because we incurred a bunch of expenses. We didn't actually pay on any of those expenses this month. We pay in on 'em next month or two months from now.

So our eight, our at balance went up. So it's preserving our cash. So even though in this particular month we had negative net income, our cash position from operations actually increased by, uh, $627,000. [00:43:00] Uh, as we go down the next section, we have cash from investing activities. So here, um, there's usually gonna be CapEx.

That's the most common one you're gonna see as a negative, uh, in investing activities, maybe by a vehicle or a piece of equipment. You'll see that showing up as a negative number. And because that, um, uh. That, that expense doesn't hit your income statement, right? You go buy a vehicle that ends up being a fixed asset on your balance sheet.

So it doesn't actually reduce the net income on your p and l. It has to be a reconciling item here on your, uh, your statement of cash flows. And then down below here, you have all your financing activities. So again, maybe you had, um, negative $50,000 and that didn't come that month, but your cash balance went up by a hundred grand.

Well, that maybe that just cash balance went up just because you took out a huge loan, right? Maybe you just, uh, took, you know, drew a bunch in your line of credit so your cash went up. Um, but that doesn't tell the whole story, right? Maybe your business was actually [00:44:00] unprofitable. That's why you have to be looking at all three of these statements together of, you know, just because my cash balance went up doesn't mean my business is doing well.

Um. You need to know the whole story behind why the cash balance went up, and that's what the statement cash flow is answering. So here we're paying down some debt, and then in total we have our beginning cash balance, our change in the cash balance for the month, and then our ending cash. Uh, any questions on the statement of cash flows?

That one's a bit tricky, but I'd say it's potentially the most important one on the, uh, of the three financial statements.

Alright, cool. Statement of cash flows. Um, oh, one other thing I, I figured I'd mention, um, it's always something I think it's super important to note is that, uh, EBITDA doesn't equal cash flow, right? And this ties directly into what I was just talking about with the, uh, this, the, uh, statement cash flows, right?

EBITDA might be one number one month. But [00:45:00] you might, uh, you know, EBITDA might be really high after a month, but all of it went to accounts receivable and you didn't actually put any of that money in your pocket. So just because you have a high ebitda, it doesn't mean that you have enough cash that month to, to sustain your company.

So you wanna understand not only what your EBITDA is, but also how all the other items on your, uh, on your financial statements impact how much free cashflow you're gonna have that month. You know, maybe you have high ebitda, but then you also have a debt payment. You also have maybe taxes to pay. You might also have to make some capital expenditures in your business.

You might have had a huge increase in working capital because you sent out a bunch of invoices you can get paid on. Um, and all that's gonna negatively impact your free cashflow for that particular month despite having a high ebitda. So it's a really good analysis for you to do understand not only, all right, what is ebitda?

About how much cash am I actually put in my pocket?[00:46:00] 

All right. Um, just to bring 'em home. Um, so we got three main financial statements, right? Your income statement and your balance sheet and your statement of cash flows. Uh, the questions that each one of those are answering, right? Income statement, how much, uh, how profitable is my business, um, in its specific period of time.

My balance sheet was my business own, and was it o uh, at any particular point in time? And then the statement of cash flows. Where did my cash come from? And then where did it go? Uh, during, during some period of time that you're looking at, uh, things to look for, right? You always look at trends month, month over month, year over year.

And I think that's jumping out as a potential anomalies versus either historicals or versus what you expect from, uh, industry standards. Uh, balance sheet. You'll be looking at working capital sufficiency. Can the business cover its short term obligations? Um, what kind of CapEx is required for that particular company?

And then statement of cash flows, [00:47:00] really understanding how cash works in your company, uh, how you keep the lights on, right? Um, what, what does that, again, tying back to that working capital cycle, that business, uh, awesome. That's, uh, that's all I got for you. Happy to answer any questions or go back and re-talk about anything if, uh, if it went too fast.

But yeah, 

**Athena:** that, uh, it was really helpful. Chris and I, I love how you, um, you know, do your best to explain very complicated, uh, concepts very simply. Um, so I love the three questions. I think that's really powerful. Um, so I, I'm finding, you know, like, uh, e every business is so unique. The p and l, you know, we tend to focus mostly on the p and ls, but it really doesn't tell the full story.

Um, and I know we're gonna get into accounting next week, but I, I'm finding this really interesting. [00:48:00] Um, you know, I was looking at our, our statements actually as you were going through things. I was like, okay, cool. You know, like how good are we keeping these all updated? And I think the balance sheet for sure can often get ignored by business owners, maybe even the, the p and l themselves.

You know, like you were saying at the beginning, most, most owners don't even use these statements to manage their business. They're looking at their bank accounts. Right. Um, so I wanted to see if we could have some fun, like just creating a scenario or maybe even, you know, 'cause this is close to home so people can see where, where this hits on on each of the statements.

So, for example, um, we do project based work essentially. So we can take on a client and we're gonna be working with them for up to 12 to 14 months now. Um, and we charge people in, in, in payments, you know, [00:49:00] for that work. So it's worked, delivered over an amount of time, but the payments themselves might come before the work is fully delivered.

And if you're not paying attention to, uh, where that goes, then it can just hit a profit and loss statement, income statement as cash, even though, or as income, right? Like if I just booked that as income and I don't do anything else on that, then to the IRS. Like that's, I, I owe taxes. I made that as income in that month, even though I have to deliver for the next 14 months.

So, um. How often then do you see owners not have their books accurately reflecting like when they did work versus when they made the sale, versus when that income actually hit their bank account on a percentage basis? What, what percentage of of owners are [00:50:00] actually giving their books up to date with all of that stuff?

**Chris:** Yeah, that's a great question. And it depends somewhat on the business, right? So, uh, because there's various levels of complexity of, uh, how, how hard it's gonna be. It, it calls the matching principle in accounting. Mm-hmm. Or you wanna match your revenue and expenses together. Um, and for some companies that's really easy, right?

Like if you're, um, a restaurant and let's say you don't. Track, like anything you like, you know, you just, you pay stuff when it comes in, uh, all your inventory gets expensed right away. Well, it's food, right? You're probably not keeping on hand very long and when someone pays you, it is not like you, you know, you don't do ar for a restaurant, right?

You, you pay on the day. So it's, even if they do no work to try and match things together as best they can, a restaurant's probably doing a pretty good job of matching the revenues expenses. 'cause the, you know, they buy the food, they're probably selling it within [00:51:00] 10 days and then, uh, depending on the restaurant, and then they're, they're getting paid at the point of sale, like at the point of delivery.

And then they're paying their staff probably that week too. So like, everything's happening in a very short period of time. So it, it's, it's probably, they're probably doing it right. Well, if you take another business, like maybe a construction company, um, like we're just working on a deal recently with this, uh, this business, they, they built, uh, airplane hangers.

Like long construction projects, take multiple months, sometimes multiple years for them to do. Um, and they're gonna do progress billing, right? So they're gonna have all these expenses coming in. They might pre-order stuff. And then, uh, so all these expenses are hitting this one month, and then they're gonna have to send an invoice based off certain milestones later down the road.

You could see how with that type of a business, it can get really tricky to keep track of. [00:52:00] Uh, did I put my revenue in the right month with the right expenses? And it's, it's a very complicated area of accounting, of doing percent completion accounting, is what that's called. Um, so it's gonna depend on the business you're buying.

You should, or you should probably know as you're looking at particular industries. Is this a company that has, uh, the tendency to, you know, it's almost like it's gonna be really easy for them to, to match revenue expenses. There's probably not gonna be issues. Or is it one where Yeah, it's gonna get a lot more complicated.

And do they, are they, are they putting in the effort? Do they have an accountant that's helping them with that to make sure that revenues and expenses are matching? Um, we just had a deal recently where. It was a construction project. It was a construction project based business. And, uh, they had been sending out a lot of invoices like earlier and earlier, um, which resulted in them recognizing a bunch of revenue before the expenses came in.

It ended up being that we pulled $2 million of revenue out of the [00:53:00] last 12 month period because they had like precent, a bunch of these invoices. So I guess to answer your question of like how often if it's a business that. Uh, it doesn't matter. In they're, they're probably bad, pretty good percentage.

It's probably close enough where it's not super material or it matters. If it's a business that, uh, does have those percent completion type issues, uh, it's a lot more common that they're gonna be doing it improperly unless they're, you know, really on the ball. So, 

**Athena:** right. So as we're looking at these businesses, you know, before we're under LOI and able to get all of these detailed statements, and something that we can be asking these sellers is like, how do you get paid when you get paid?

Right. So, understanding. Okay. When do you make a sale and when do you actually get the money for that sale? And, and when you get the money, is the job done or is the job about to start? Right. So like, in just basic language. 

**Lisa:** Mm-hmm. 

**Athena:** Um, how, [00:54:00] how do you get paid? When do you get paid and how long are you delivering on that work that you're getting paid?

I'm wondering if you can talk about the, the difference or the subtleties between accounts receivable and deferred revenue. 

**Chris:** Yeah, absolutely. And one other thing, just to go back, like another way that you quickly indicate that, that they're probably not doing it right, is by looking at their gross margins.

So if you see their gross margins one year is they, you talk to the seller, they're like, yeah, we, 40% is about where we're at. And then in one year you see 20% and then the next year you see 80%. It's probably 'cause they booked all the revenue in the one year and then all the expenses in the other year. And so, mm-hmm.

Um, and then to your next question, differences between, uh, accounts receivable and, uh, and, and deferred revenue are un unearned revenue. Sometimes my ear called. Um, so if a business has, uh, received, let's say, you know, [00:55:00] 50 grand for work, but they haven't done any of that work yet, and then they're gonna have to do that work over the next, uh, let's say six months, um, the proper.

Accounting for that should be that, that 50 grand when it comes in the door, it doesn't get booked to revenue, it gets booked actually as a liability, as an obligation for you to do work, right? So it gets booked as, uh, a current, current liability, deferred revenue under revenue. Um, and then as you do the work, right, it comes out of there.

So then, you know, if you've done a fifth of that $50,000 project at the end of this month, then we'll take, uh, we'll take $10,000 out of that, that liability, and then book it into revenue. And that's another just way that you, you map. Um. The revenues and the expenses to match properly. 'cause really that's kinda how you're measuring it, is that when you say that you're a fifth of the way done, it's probably 'cause you've spent about a fifth of the expenses on the project, whether [00:56:00] it be your time, your team's time, or um, you know, the materials you purchased.

Uh, that's, that's a good way that it's gonna be measured. Um, how, how far along you are on that project. Um, that's another thing that should be when you're buying a business that I've seen people get screwed on before where, uh, they've let that deferred revenue be working capital. So maybe you're buying a business and it needs 500 grand of working capital to keep operations running.

And then I've seen this happen before where the. Uh, seller is like, oh, here I got this 500 grand that you can have. It's, it's my, uh, my un earned revenue. Here's this 500 grand. Um, but that 500 grand is you're, you just purchased an obligation, right? You've purchased an obligation for $500,000 that you now have to give, go do.

And so then if they give you 500 grand in cash to match that, they've really given you [00:57:00] $0 at working capital. 'cause they've given you 500 grand in cash and they've also given you a liability of 500 grand for you to go do the work. So they've really given you nothing. Um, but it can be dressed up pretty easily to someone that doesn't totally understand deferred revenue on our revenue as, oh, great, I'm getting $500,000.

This is so awesome. Um, but, uh, it's a trick. So, 

**Athena:** okay. So to, to put that into, uh, an example like, um, I own a. Pool company making pools. Mm-hmm. And I've got $500,000 that I haven't booked as, as income because I'm still in the middle of that project that I need to complete. 

**Chris:** Yeah. Pool service, you get paid at the beam of the summer.

Right. Someone pays you five grand, you're like, all right, every week you're gonna come clean my pool and it's just covered for the summer. Right. And if you buy that business at the beginning [00:58:00] of the summer and they give you that, that five grand, but then they're also giving you the obligation to go do the work.

Right. It's, it's really zero. 

**Athena:** Right. Okay. So yeah, instead of building the pool, then let, let's say maybe you charge people quarterly for your pool maintenance service. Yeah. You know, and they, they've got like a quarter, they got their quarterly payments and they're like, I'll give that to you. But like, actually as a new business owner, if they would've kept it, you still would've had to deliver it and pay for that.

Um, but in, in, in a addition to that, you're gonna need money. To run your business outside of the obligations that you have, which is working capital. That's, you know, paying all the other obligations you have, have as a business owner, like your insurance or your bookkeepers or, um, you know, the, the gas that you need for your trucks.

It's not necessarily going to come out of that deferred in, uh, deferred revenue. So, uh, the difference between accounts receivable then and deferred revenue is deferred revenue is cash I've received, [00:59:00] but I haven't delivered the work yet. So I'm not booking it on my income statement as income earned. It's actually a liability 'cause I owe that work.

Accounts receivable is cash that I am due. But somebody has not paid me yet. 

**Chris:** Mm-hmm. Yep. Is that, is 

**Athena:** that an easy 

**Chris:** exactly like 

**Athena:** basic word way of, of defining that? And this, both of these, y'all are on the balance sheet. They're not gonna show up on the p and l. So that's why it's important to also, like, clearly you have all these, all these statements, but know that there's a story in the balance sheet and the statement of cash flows.

Um, Chris, I don't know if you have a simple way of, just like you did with the question for each statement, do you have a simple way of breaking down how each one talks to each other? Like, is there like kind of one thing that connects each of them that you should be looking at or, or how? Um, yeah, I don't, I know it's a [01:00:00] very complicated process.

I don't know if you have a simple way of explaining it like you did with your three questions. I really like that. 

**Chris:** Yeah. Well, there, there is one number that will show up on all of 'em that's net income. So at the very bottom of, uh. Of the, uh, the income statement, right? You're calculating net income. And then net income is also in the equity section of the balance sheet.

And then net income is the starting number of the statement of cash flows as you're reconciling the three. Um, so then net incomes always is included in the, it matches the exact same number on all three statements. They're, they're all tied together through that process. Um, they're all tied together through all the numbers though as well.

So, uh, like as I was kind of laying out there, uh, with the statement of cash flows of, you know, net income might be high, but then, you know, how does that actually impact cash? Did ar go up, did AP go down? Um, they, they all do flow together depending on what transaction we're talking about. [01:01:00] Um, you can actually calculate the entire statement of cash flows just by knowing the income statement and the balance sheet.

So if you, if you know, if you have an income statement and a balance sheet, you don't need, like in, if you're, if you know what you're doing, you don't need a statement and a cash flow, you can just calculate it yourself. Um, because the net net income you have from the income statement and then all the changes in AR and AP and fixed assets, all that, and equity, right?

You, you just know that month over month on the balance sheet. So they're all, they're all just talking to each other. 

**Athena:** So, um, just some, going back to the deferred revenue, um, if, if you're seeing that on a balance sheet, that's absolutely sounds like, you know, point of discussion. Need to make sure that that's being left and that, and, and I'm assuming that's, that's factored into the, the WIP calculation work in progress.

So, um, what should folks be looking [01:02:00] at for, and or bringing up as a discussion point on that? And 

**Chris:** there is nuance there too. So, um, for example, like a SaaS business, uh, we've done a few of those deals where there is maybe you're paying 12 months upfront, right? That's a pretty common thing with a software you, you buy 12 months upfront, you save 10% or something.

Um, that's technically un earned revenue for that software company. The problem is with a software company versus maybe like a construction company that also has under revenue, uh, is that the marginal cost to service that revenue is basically zero, right? So I, if they have $200,000 of under revenue in a SaaS business, you're gonna have a hard time convincing them that you need $200,000 of cash in order to offset that liability you purchased, right?

Because. There's really, like, you're not gonna have to spend 200 grand or to service that revenue, um, that you know that they earned. So there is some nuance there in how it's gonna handle the transaction depending on [01:03:00] the type of business. But in general, with most like home services type companies, if you are seeing that, yeah, you, you wanna make sure that you're, you're getting whatever that balance is.

And so that WIP calculation, they do tie into each other, um, of, okay, all here's all the projects that are outstanding. Uh, how far along are we, uh, in each one of these projects? Um, it, it is a very complicated area of accounting, but what with this is percent completion accounting. Basically the WIP calculation is percent completion accounting, where they're, um, every project that's outstanding right now, everyone that's in process, you make a list of here's how much I, uh, I.

I expect to get paid in total on the project. Here's how much I expect to spend in total on a project. Here's how much I've been paid on the project or sent invoices for. Right. Here's how much I've booked, has earned, here's how much I've [01:04:00] incurred as expenses so far. And with those four numbers, you can calculate the work in process, you know?

All right. I expect to, to earn a hundred thousand dollars on the project, but I've only billed $10,000, okay? Or I've only received $10,000. Um, I expect to spend $50,000 and I have spent 25,000. So in that case, I've spent 25. I expect to spend 50. I'm halfway done, but I've only invoiced for 10,000 of the a hundred thousand.

So there's a mismatch there where I should have recognized half of that a hundred grand in revenue. I should have recognized $50,000, but I've only recognized 10. So that's where there's a WIP calculation that gets done of, okay, I need to book an extra 40 grand of revenue onto my balance sheet, I, excuse me, onto my income statement.

And then the offset goes in your balance sheet, and then it can go the other way. Right? Maybe you've billed 50 grand, but you've only [01:05:00] spent like 5,000 on the project. So then you have to do the other, other way where, okay, now I have to take some revenue out 'cause I've overbooked revenue on that. It, it gets, it's, uh, it's a very, it could get very messy as you could see, right?

When you deal with like a real live company and like, which expenses went where, and maybe there's 30 projects going on. But, um, it's the, it's an important thing to be looking at if you have that type of business. 

**Athena:** Absolutely. And most owners are not using bookkeepers. They're doing it themselves. So the chances of them actually doing deferred revenue properly, you know, they might have been even a lot of.

Tax, uh, tax. And, um, uh, they might be paying a lot more in taxes. For example, if they, they weren't doing this properly, right? Because they were, they're just like, I made it, it hit my bank account. It's going on my p and l. Um. Or they, they have, you know, somebody doing the books that doesn't understand this sort of stuff.

So really important, like, you know, obviously preview [01:06:00] next week we're gonna be talking like accounting for business owners and these different types of things and how to do it and that sort of thing. Um, but I imagine you come across this, 'cause you do the qvs also. You come across that they haven't done it properly.

So during the QQV process, are you rebuilding the financials as they should have been done? So you can see all this stuff? 

**Chris:** Yeah. Yeah. So we're, we're always looking at these things. Revenue recognition is always a big one. It's probably behind working capital. Probably the second biggest issue that we see, uh, in our diligence process.

Um, so we, we will recalculate like that percent completion calculation. If they haven't done it, we're gonna redo it over the historical period that we're looking at. So we know. And we can fix, basically, instead of seeing these monthly margins, sometimes you'll see, you'll see like negative a hundred and 10th percent gross margin and then positive 400%.

And it's like these wild swings. And so you could do this recalculation of, uh, of doing that percent completion calculation every month for the historical [01:07:00] period. Now, depends on the data you have available. Sometimes they do a decent job of keeping track of. Profitability by project, and they actually do put the expenses in.

They just don't know how to do this entry each month. Mm-hmm. So if you can go and grab that data, you can compile it and manipulate it and, you know, if you know what you're doing, you can, you can recalculate it all Historically, sometimes they don't do that at all. They don't track anything by project.

And so then you have to find some other ways to do it. Maybe you can grab the hours of each person by project or you know, what their gross margin should have been for that period. You can look at the bid sheets and you, you can do some things to, to get to that figure. And it's kinda like a hierarchy of like, okay, we have great data, we can redo it to, you know, we're doing, uh, the best we possibly can, what we got.

So. 

**Athena:** Right. Um, it's interesting too because, um, uh, you know, when you buy the business, you end up often understanding the financials better than the owner themselves. Um, because you're going through this process and having folks like. Chris and his team, uh, [01:08:00] do all the financials and help you understand them.

Um, someone that we both know we worked on together, and this wasn't the the business you did the QB on, but like they, it ended up being an issue that they knew the, the, the, you know, financials better than the owner after the fact because the owner didn't understand how they build and how the revenue is recognized and what working capital needed to be.

And, um, you know, that can end up being a, an issue. So how often are you seeing folks come, come up against that? You do all this work, you guys understand the, the numbers better than the owner does, and then you have to go and explain, Hey, your books were wrong. Mm-hmm. Uh, here's what we're seeing. How does that conversation typically go?

**Chris:** It's tough, and I think the, the best course, uh, in that case is to probably not go right to the seller with that and say, Hey, you're, you did this wrong. Is to probably start with a broker and then maybe get their accountant involved. Um. Because as long as you have good support and like you weren't [01:09:00] taking like, unreasonable positions or anything like that, like it's, it's just accounting, right?

Like if they, if you can get their advisors to understand what you did and and beyond. Your side that you, you did it accurately and properly. Um, then them talking to the seller is gonna be a much better conversation than you just getting one-on-one with the seller and saying, Hey, you did all these numbers wrong, and like going through accounting.

And then they get confused and frustrated and tell you, uh, you're trying to screw me and then storm out. Right. So it's better to, you know, explain it to their advisors first. Make sure that, you know, you can have a level ahead and get them on board with understanding it and then, um, they can help bridge that conversation with the seller.

At least in my experience. That's what I've seen. 

**Athena:** So, so would you say that like, the advisors on their side, like they, they're. CPAs, accountants, bookkeepers, they're not the cause of the problem. They're helpful in that. Or do you sometimes end up in that situation where the people that we're supporting 'em aren't doing it?

Right? 

**Chris:** Yeah. It, it depends, [01:10:00] right? So like, if they have a, uh, if they just have like an internal bookkeeper or they have like just a, a bookkeeper that just does the books and you know, it is all cash basis and just, you know, make sure the bank comes reconciled. Like sometimes that happens and they're not.

Really doing technical accounting very often, but they can reconcile a bank account, right? So sometimes they have that person and yeah. Accusing that person and it is probably not a good course of action. And even trying to explain it to them, it's probably not gonna go very well. Mm-hmm. But in most cases, if they have a, a decent accountant and you go through that question, them like, maybe that account was just engaged to do the tax return and they do the tax return and the taxes are done on cash basis, so it doesn't really matter.

All this accrual stuff's being done. And so that's it. Right? It's, it's, it's getting done how it gets done. Um, but if, if you can sit down, like, explain to them and, and show what you found, like, oh yeah. Well, on an accrual basis, that's how it would be done. And, and maybe walk through that, then you'll have a better, some better luck.

So, [01:11:00] 

**Athena:** got it. Um, folks, if you have any questions, like please by all means, I'm, I'm kind of hogging the mic, but also wanted to make sure that you got, uh, a really, um, good kind of overview and understanding of the different financial statements. I know one that we haven't taken a, a whole bunch of look at is the statement of cash flows.

Um, any questions on anything Chris went through? Anything that you saw or anything you wanted to pull up again and just like break it down in further detail? Um. Oh, okay. Lisa, you, you had a story. So, um, Lisa and I've known each other for quite a while, even though she's one of our newest clients. Um, she was actually, uh, like quite deep into a deal.

Do you wanna talk about that, Lisa? And you, you learned about project based accounting? Yeah, 

**Lisa:** so yeah, I learned about it last year. Um, we got a queue of e done and, um, found out that they were doing their project based accounting incorrectly, um, not recognizing expenses and [01:12:00] revenues when they should have.

And so that threw off all of their numbers. And so when we got the Q of E back, we tried to renegotiate based off of what the numbers should have been. And, um, the owners were not willing to renegotiate even though, uh, we had our CPA explain. Everything. And, and we actually got him on a call with them and go through it in detail.

I also just wanted to take a moment here to say, Chris, wow. I did listen to the two other recordings where you went over QOV and there were some reports in there that we didn't get with ours, and the level of detail was like, wow. I thought I knew a little bit about it, but like my level of understanding just skyrocketed and I love it.

Um, [01:13:00] there, there's some great reports that are in there, so, um. Wow. That's all I gotta say. 

**Chris:** Thank you. Made my week. Chris. 

**Athena:** Chris. Chris is awesome. Um, and also if you, uh, connect with him or follow him on LinkedIn, he puts a lot of really great explainer content on there around all this stuff that he and his team does.

So, um, absolutely recommend a file follow and deep consideration when you guys are at the QV and or needing accounting. So you're gonna get wowed next week on the accounting side of things and, um, wow, you know, this accrual versus cash and how it affects your tax situation and booking revenue and all of that stuff.

Like, it'll blow your mind, um, because you can make your income statements. Looks so wildly different. Like, and as you found out, Lisa, right? Like you, you got income statements, it looked super favorable and you're like, excited to buy this business. And when it was done properly, it's like, [01:14:00] oh, it's not nearly as exciting now.

But they were like, but that's, you know, cash, meat collected it is. Like, but that's not how this works. So, um, thanks Lisa for your, your, um, comment and story and, and definitely hope y'all can make next week also. 'cause, um, I, I think, um. And, and Chris, something I really like about your style is how, how, uh, well, you're able to explain kind of complicated concepts.

So I'm really excited to have that conversation and kind of the, the level of needs of accounting and bookkeeping and, and, and how they're, they're really different, right? Like you just we're saying bookkeeping. Oh, it's like reconciling bank accounts. But there's so much more to it, especially if you have a business that's not delivering the work immediately when, when it gets paid, right?

If there's complexity to the business, like inventory or project based work, or differences in when you're getting paid and when you're not, it's, it's gonna be really important to pay attention to that. Um, [01:15:00] so super excited for that. Um, thank you so much. Anything else you think is important about financial statements before we sign off?

**Chris:** No, I think, I think we've covered a lot of ground. Um, yeah, I hope I didn't confuse anybody anymore by putting up all the numbers and everything like that. So I hope, uh, I hope you guys enjoyed it. I, 

**Athena:** I, I thought it was, uh, really helpful actually to see them all and as you explained it and, um, you know, three questions, I'm gonna keep going back to that, right?

Like, what, what does each statement helping us achieve? What do we need to answer there? So it was super awesome. If you don't mind, we'd love to grab those slides and, and include it with the replay too. Um, we'll share your details with everybody here, uh, as always. And then we'll see you next week for part two, accounting for business Owners.

So, um, really excited for that. Thank you for investing all this time into us in the group. Um, fantastic, as always. As Lisa said, couldn't set it better myself. Wow. Awesome. 

**Chris:** Well, appreciate you guys having me. And yeah, definitely look forward to seeing you [01:16:00] next week, and I'll ship those slides over to you.

**Athena:** Amazing. Thanks so much, Chris. Thanks everyone for attending. We'll see you next time. Take care. Bye.
