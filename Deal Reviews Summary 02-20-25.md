  Hello. What a nail better hey.

0:13 - Luke Gillespie
  Dance.

0:16 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  What's that?

0:17 - AcquiMatch Team
  That was intense.

0:20 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Nearly started balling my eyes out at one point.

0:26 - AcquiMatch Team
  That was good.

0:28 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Hey David. Welcome to the first deal review. That was quite the first virus call join too.

0:35 - David R
  That's inspiring.

0:37 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  That's amazing.

0:38 - David R
  Yeah.

0:39 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah. do you think?

0:42 - David R
  It's great. mean, like you get to know the client. You get to know really cool stories. It's amazing.

0:50 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah.

0:51 - David R
  We're not as an exceptional human being. Yeah.

0:57 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Any big takeaways for. No, this was after he bought the business that they thought he was a Home Depot worker.

2:06 - AcquiMatch Team
  Okay. Okay. I thought, um, there's like a, so, so what he just, he didn't tell, they didn't announce it.

2:16 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  He just just turned up was sitting in the owner's chair in the office asking employees for their  security, social security numbers.

2:25 - Luke Gillespie
  they had no idea he was the new owner.

2:29 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  No announcement, no conversation. I met with one of his employees that was like telling me the the story.

2:35 - Luke Gillespie
  They all came to and he was just like, yeah, like here's this guy just sitting in my boss's chair asking me for my social security number and like the deal it already closed.

2:46 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Renan was the owner.

2:48 - AcquiMatch Team
  No, I agree. The part I thought our financing was good because I just so far and the off market deals are been involved in.  It's like these guys want zero seller financing. And I had to say like, before I even started, you know, working here, I had like just learned about seller financing.  And I was always like, who would want seller financing? Like, it's just right, like, avoid that at all costs.  But now, like hearing these stories. Yeah, it makes sense. It's a part of it's about confidence about having confidence in the person you're doing business with and be like, look, I need you to hold some of this so you can have some skin in the game, right?  And I'll make sure you're compensated. But this is going to help with this transition. And I want to make sure I want to feel that you're going to be there for me, right?  So building that relationship and then selling, then using some of tactics that he he described about how to make it still seem financially beneficial for them as well, not just like healthy for

5:00 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  start talking structure or evaluation until that owner sees the only possible option to sell the business to. And once they say that and see that, then you can get into the structuring and how we're going to do this and that sort of thing because it's like they want you to be the owner of their business.  On market, we don't have that. like, man, the thing I posted about the broker calls today, the brokers are like, people are asking me for confidential info before they even sign an NDA and, you know, selling, sending LIs before they've even had a conversation with the owner.  the brokers don't want that either. brokers want people developing relationships and stuff too. And that's the only reason, honest to God, like, I stayed in my like eight million dollar deal as long as I did because first call with the owner.  So I was like, Hey, I'll try to tell us and come and see you. Would you like that? And broker was like, ah, and they're like, yeah, that would be great.

5:59 - Luke Gillespie
  And I was like, how's the this weekend, you know, and I like gotten my car.

6:03 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  And this is something I've been meaning to tell you guys, but like, something that goes so far is like, when you have those first one or two conversations and making sure you find out what the owner is interested in, what are you going to do with your time?  So like, the first call with the owner is like, what are you guys going to do? when you have your time back, and they're like, our kids are in high school, we want to travel, we want to take them them around the world.  So that weekend, I hopped in my car, drove three and a half hours to Dallas, and they knew I lived in Austin.  So they knew I was driving three and a half hours to come and meet them. And I got a little like, beautiful, big wall travel map that they could do with their family and scratch off the different countries that they go to as a family, right?  So it's like, I showed up at that meeting with that gift for them. And that's the only reason they deliberated as long as they did on my offer, which was $2 million.  There's less than what they were getting from everybody else. Like, because they wanted me to be the owner, just didn't  structure it, right?  Um, so that relationship building and like, Nash did that too. He's going to talk about that and that's where we can dig into it next week.  But like the owner, he just bought him some like $15 golf balls. the guy said he wanted a golf more and he showed up at that first meeting in person with the golf balls.  It's such a good, I mean, for like 50 bucks or last, know, to like show up in a meeting with something for them.  It's like, now you've got the reciprocity thing, you've listened to them, you know what their interests are outside of work.  And you're also seating something that like, they are going to be able to do once they sell the business, you know?  It's like, they want to use that travel map. I'm, I'm like, I am your ticket to you using that travel map because I'm going to look after your business so well.  And you go do that thing with your kids, you know, or golf or whatever.

7:59 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah, that's. Right. Maybe have Jason get to reach a gift of whatever is geographically related to where he wants to go and move to his daughters.  Like if they're in Florida, get some flip flops, get them a pair of boards.

8:14 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, not a bad idea, Luke. And this is something I don't know if I ever pulled it out, but it's something we should do more of on or off market, right?  Like if we can get little indicators, Luke, when you're talking to the brokers or Ryan, when you're talking to them or coaching the clients to ask them, like, you know, what do you do in your spare time?  What are you into, like, find some common interest or something, you know? And then being able to like, on that first meeting, like, hey, I thought of you, like, how different is that from every other experience that somebody's showing up and like, I listened, I know you have interests outside of this and treating you like a human and I got your little gift.

8:56 - AcquiMatch Team
  Yeah.

8:57 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  I did it with the car, I don't it's like negotiating on this car wash forever. It's a it's called Jurassic and they have animatronic dinosaurs.  I was like, if I buy a car wash, this is my car wash, like it's just like giant dinosaurs that you put a quarter in and then I'm talking to them like as you're driving into the car wash, there's this like pterodactyl that's sitting on your windshield, know.  No, it's such an Austin theme is like keep Austin weird. So it was just this institution of Austin. It was in the like visit Austin books and stuff like that.  this guy John was such a character and like every time we had a meeting, I would like drive down to his office and in his office, he had like old cars, he had all these old like coke vending machine.  was just like his little playground and this like big. And the front was like a museum only for him and then he had a shop and he was really into aliens.  and he wanted to sell his wash in Austin so he could go start a new wash a couple hours away near his ranch and he wanted to make it alien themed.  So guess what I turned up with? When I went there to negotiate on that deal. a little alien mug, I had a little alien, kind of that this sign behind me.  bought little alien sign and I was like for your new wash or he wanted uh six million dollars and we started talking about like him leasing the property of me and me just buying the wash and like he actually entertained he wanted three million for the wash and he actually entertained me when I was like I will pay you seven hundred and twenty five thousand for it.  We talked forever and he's like get your investors to pay for it. was like I can't make it make sense you know and it's on this like really up and coming part of Austin's South Congress.  And we talked for ages and I was like in Indonesia, like trying to have calls with him to like negotiate stuff.  mean, was wild. Eventually, I was just like, look, I can come up to 1.2, but that's it. He's like, no, I'm gonna get the six for it.  And I was like, okay. And right before, and he would like send me little pictures of like him in a magazine or like snapshots of his monthly report after that.  was like, this is the guy that just won't let you go. Like, this is so weird. Like, he's just sending me these like random, like, don't forget about me.  See how good we're doing, you know. And then at Christmas, right around Christmas, I get this message from me.  He's like, sold the wash. Six.

11:51 - AcquiMatch Team
  Yeah.

11:55 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  I mean, that was, that was like, over a year, you know, he ended up selling it in the end.  because of the real estate. I'm sure they're gonna knock it down and turn it into condos in that area.  But it was just so hilarious. He also has a pet wash on that property where people can come and wash their pets and stuff.  And so I would always, I'd be like, just tell me about the wash, tell me your stories. And I'd sit there for hours while you would just tell me these stories.  like, it's like, yeah, remember one time I was freezing and I got a notification that there was people in the wash.  So of course I went down to like investigate. So there's a human notification and the whole thing shut down, so you had to go down there.  And he goes down there and there's girls filming content in like little white outfits when it's below freezing.

12:48 - Luke Gillespie
  he's like, yeah, they were saying it was for social media or something.

12:52 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  was like, not exactly. He's like, yeah, they're in the pet wash wash. each other down. I was like, are you serious?  And he's like, yeah, they're they're security footage of it. And I was like, you have to send me this.  So he's like, are you sure that's not weird? And I was like, I want to see it. So he said me these like photos of these girls like filming content in the car wash and in the pet wash, like glow freezing.  Guess what channel that was for. Anyway, so it was like hours and hours and hours of time, you know, so I think if we can encourage people to build relationships and get those stories and John literally he genuinely wanted me to buy the wash.  He wanted to mentor me wanted me to buy the wash. We just couldn't make the numbers work, you know, same with the other business in Texas, like they wanted me to buy it and just couldn't get the numbers to work.  I didn't know enough about structuring and how to do all that to make it work car wash is still a real estate place.  as far as I'm concerned. But the other one, I could have, I could have, I could have fricking offered.

14:05 - David R
  I could have matched their offer.

14:09 - AcquiMatch Team
  Yeah, it's like, I'm trying to think why like maybe like Joe and Jason are a little bit like jumping the gun and want to get to everything like, like, how do you balance it correctly?  And it's because they're definitely anxious. They want this to happen. Like, you know, I have the calls with them and like leading up to this and they're just like, where's the next deal?  Where's the next deal? Where's opportunity? Like, they just wanted to happen so bad. That's hard for them to be like, okay, this is now it's, this is about the relationship part.  And they really can't stress it enough. Like when I kind of talk to people, it's like, you got to build that relationship.  You know, I told you that about Gill about that off-market call. Like, one time we got off here. How was the call of Gill?  Like, good. He kind of just blitzed through question. and then didn't make the seller feel great and it's just I'm trying to think like what would make them feel more comfortable taking the time to build the relationship and not try to rush to the finish line because it takes yeah it's a process right I mean listen what he said months three months to get the seller financing kind of thing done after 30 other conversations with business owners about it wow 30 off-market conversations with business owners before he got to this one yeah you got to really want it huh like though a little about the golf thing but but no it's good to hear that stuff it's just this is just not an easy thing to do which is why what we're doing what we're doing  like, but I think it is like, it is important just for me to continue to stress relationships, relationships, relationships, be the be the right by or be the person they want to work with.  I could probably do that a little bit more than I've been doing. I mean, I tell them like that.  But they're very, they very much want to know if they have the right question structure and I'm like, okay, yes, and we'll get through that.  But I think I can be a little bit more, build relationships, because look at all this stuff that's going on, you're going to really need to, you don't want know how long you're going to be this person is going to be involved in your life.

16:40 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah.

16:42 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  One hundred percent something or an on the side that I was thinking about Gil when he said it is looking as free, but you get experience.  Like, it doesn't cost you anything to look. I was like, oh my God, like, I hope Gil  took that in.  Especially when you have as much free time as Gil. Yeah, he's got. I mean, he's full time doing this.  It doesn't cost you anything to look and you get experience while you do it. And we're not glasses over it.  And that's the thing. He doesn't realize how what he's doing is so exceptional compared to everybody. 30 different conversations with sellers.  To try because he didn't have any money to buy these businesses. So he was having to, and he was building relationships with 30 different owners to try to get to the point that he did.

17:32 - AcquiMatch Team
  Yeah, it's crazy. That story was crazy. And now when you say it like that to it just makes me reflect on my, oh my gosh.

17:46 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah.

17:48 - AcquiMatch Team
  The amount of work they had the role of the amount of work you had to do. The success he had in the deal, the first year of success and then boom.  And then you got to go back to. your job and that is good. Then he went through like the depression and then like, that is a roller coaster.

18:11 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  It was really  scary for a while there. Like, it's really scary. Like there was months where he was like that, you know, every conversation I had with him.  I was just like, right. I don't want this to be the last one, you know, like it was it was that bad and like he's on the other side of it.  Thank God. But like this. He I think that's the thing when you swing so big, then you can you can like you can have all the really, really positive stuff.  But also the really you swing that big and there's there's huge huge repercussions on the other side. If it doesn't work out the way you want.  on it. Oh.

19:02 - AcquiMatch Team
  Yeah. Yeah, the reframing thing, getting people that can reframe, that's good. That's important. Yeah, I know what he means about like, know, he's like, he had all these people that he wanted to make proud or support, you know, and then he said a lot of the same things, like this is just business, business fails.  thing as Mike was saying kind of the same thing. was like, was beating myself up so much, tying your personal success, your life, success, the business, you know.

19:47 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  It's because especially like the American culture of what you do is who you are when it really should be separate, right?  Like, This business's success or failure is not who I am, but it's almost impossible when you're a founder to separate enough people to do that with their jobs.  I get fired, what does that mean about me and the bad person? it's like, no, or even if you get laid off, it's not about you, but it's so hard for people to who they are from what they do.  And I learned that lesson very late in life and even still on this, I would very much struggle to do that.  But it's why all this stuff outside of work, the relationships, going to Jiu Jitsu or Jim or whatever it is that you do to take care of yourself and making sure you're investing into the other parts of your life is how you weather that.  But, man, running a business is very, even for me, very isolating, because not a lot of people, do it, not a lot of people understand that.  So if you don't surround yourself with other people that they get it, it can feel awful. And then people that are too afraid to be entrepreneurs will be like, oh, just get a job, don't do that.  they think they're protecting you by telling you not to do something that they wouldn't do themselves. But I had that conversation with a lot of entrepreneurs or future entrepreneurs is what I call them.  And they're thinking about starting a business. And so I'm like, everyone in your life is gonna try to protect you and telling you not to do this.  So only listen to people that have done it themselves. Otherwise you gotta turn the rest of it out and appreciate that they're just trying to save you and protect you.

21:41 - AcquiMatch Team
  That's their way of doing it because they're too afraid to do something like that themselves. Yeah, some of them I think are just actually trying to reaffirm their decisions in life.  So like you, they take the safe route, right? And then you go take some risk and they're slightly scared.  that you're going to be successful and you're going to, and they're going to have to reflect on themselves are, are they living too safe in the life?  So they can come back down to their level so that they can feel confident that they've made the right decision that you were going to fail and so now you're back and now I was making the right decision the whole time, you know.  So some people want you, like your parents want you to be comfortable, but I think your friends don't want you to see them, you want you to see you perform better than them.

22:31 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  That's, unfortunately, that's the way humans work. That's a good point Ryan. The mirror, people don't like looking in the mirror.

22:42 - AcquiMatch Team
  Yeah.

22:50 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  It's good. Like part of me is like, I hope it doesn't scare the  out of some of them, but it sounded like for Andrew and Joe was encouraging and like lit them up, you know, so.

23:00 - AcquiMatch Team
  Yeah. For sure. I mean, he was at the end. was like, I'm going to be a business owner and be successful one day.  And I had to do this. And that's I think that's how everybody feels. Like everyone knows they could stay comfortable in their job, right?  But the dream of one day owning a business outright and being your own boss, that's what's the lure that's pulling them.  So even though if it sounds dangerous, the fact that there could be like a you know, people at the end is as enough to kind of make people take this leap, you know.  So that's what I've kind of gained from like Andrew and Joe. Okay. Okay. This is this is this is the real deal.  But that's the exciting part of it too, you know.

24:00 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So the people on the call today are clients of ours because of Renan also.

24:05 - AcquiMatch Team
  Oh, okay. Yeah. Yeah.

24:08 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  But I mean, most of our clients, I'd say 75% of them are because of Renan.

24:15 - AcquiMatch Team
  Yeah.

24:19 - Luke Gillespie
  I mean, we had a big turnout to buy us some today.

24:23 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  I mean, his story alone is phenomenal, but he, you know, like I said, I wouldn't have gone after that big deal were it not for him.  I wouldn't have had investors that became our first clients. And then he told Joe about us in Action Academy.  Joe told Chris about us in Action Academy. The most, rest of them heard Renan mentioned my name on acquiring lines.  And he didn't even say her company name. was like, if you want to close, you got to talk to Athena Simpson.  And they all handed us out and found us Andrew, Dustin, Gill, Well, um, I know there's a few more that found us through, we're not just literally saying my name, that's it on the podcast, like, and he didn't have to do that.  We didn't have to like, shout us out, and he shouted Dave Collinson on that too. Like, that's, he's like, well, you know, I use Dave, but Dave was at a different company and like, Athena is the person you need to go to if you want to close and Dave's just gonna find you leads.  Like, none of us would be here. Literally, none of us if it were not where we're not.

25:32 - AcquiMatch Team
  Yeah, good, good full circle, buyer's club.

25:39 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, that's a good one. I, uh, I'm, I'm happy he was willing to share, because I knew everything that was going on and I just like, I don't know if he wants to talk about it.  That's not exactly ideal. You're like the poster child of 100% seller finance and you pull off the unbelievable and you're raising 200 million to buy a bunch more.  That goes away. way, your business is taking, you're staring down the barrel of bankruptcy, losing your house, and you haven't made seller payments in nine months, and the seller puts money back into your business.  Like, who wants to talk about that?

26:14 - Luke Gillespie
  Fernandez.

26:17 - AcquiMatch Team
  I'm interested to see that when you, when you follow him up and be like, how was it? How did you know, thanks so much?  Like, how did it go? Like, for you, what you think? I feel like he will probably feel pretty good just to vent all that and get all that out too.  Right? Because he said he hadn't talked with anybody in so long. So, for people to show appreciation for him and stuff, that's, he probably feels pretty good.

26:38 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah. Um, he was trying to call me just a second ago, so I'm going to give him a call a little bit later.  Like, just tell him thank you again. He's amazing. Like, he's a, he's one of those people, like, there's not many people made like him in the world.

26:55 - AcquiMatch Team
  Cool. I'm excited to hear what he says.

26:58 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, so that was fun. Okay. Well, well, I don't want to keep y'all much later. Um, I know we'd schedule this 12, 530 today.  It's me knew it was probably gonna be a long one. So what would you, what's the updates? saw Andrew might be putting it all together.  I've not been able to have a chance to look at stuff.

27:16 - AcquiMatch Team
  So what would you like to talk about? And David, have we did run and share the format? should I give you a quick, like, update on what the format is for this call, typically?  I told him and I tell him, we don't have too much time here. So probably best David just follow along here.  And I told David we'll take care of any questions and stuff on this one. This one's just for him to kind of listen in and see what's going on.

27:43 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah.

27:44 - AcquiMatch Team
  But okay, yeah, we covered, we touched on our clients on on Tuesday. So yeah, we can just jump into like stuff like that A H.  Yeah, he was really excited about this business. So it's an online business. So me and him scheduled a call last night.  ended up talking for an hour and a half. We pretty much just vetted the whole thing together on the call.  I found some holes in that business. And I pointed him out to him. And so I think he's taken a step back from that.  And I think that's probably wise. Luke was like, hey, there's hundreds of already inquiries on this business. And Luke got him to get on a call, one of the first ones, if not the first one, right, Luke?

28:37 - Luke Gillespie
  Maybe not the first. I think the second, though.

28:40 - AcquiMatch Team
  So Luke got him to be one of the first players on a call, which is great. And then he was excited about that, made a call.  But there's this business at one point blew up when the real estate market blew up, the kind of like in 2021 when interest rates were low and people were just scooping up back.
  SCREEN SHARING: Luke started screen sharing - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/236755845?timestamp=1786.50345  thing around, essentially. And so I left it with him. He's out, he think he has lots of ideas. So I have a lot of good ideas of what to do here.  But, you know, if you go to my Slack message, Luke, if you can just go to my Slack message real quick.  I pretty much pointed out there, right, so I put there a churn. The average churn in the last eight months is 4.8%.  If it rains at 5%, 50% of the scribers will be gone in 12 months. nearly half of his revenue could go to zero in the next 12 months unless he turns that around, gets subscribers staying, more people coming on.  So I put he's going to either need to figure out a way and to bring on more people. And if he doesn't, he's going to be  get in trouble. So he's he's going to think about that. So we'll see what happens. It does feel like it could be a good fit for him, but there's some there's some holes there.

31:13 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay, cool. Well, it sounds like he's excited and sinking his teeth into something. No, that's what we want.

31:18 - AcquiMatch Team
  And Luke got him another right up today. So fantastic.

31:24 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Nice work. Okay.

31:25 - AcquiMatch Team
  So Andrew's happy. Yeah, like we're we're we're we're going with the strategy of just like getting them these online businesses.  He said he's nine times that he's gonna like an online business more. So we're gonna Luke's kind of lining him up running them by me and then we're getting them getting them some right up.  So we're gonna try to hit him with a volume to keep him in.

31:48 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Excellent. Cool. What other updates do you have client wise that I haven't heard since Tuesday?

31:55 - AcquiMatch Team
  Cool.

31:55 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Jenny reached out to Live Oak.

32:00 - AcquiMatch Team
  Great. So Jenny's back. She's back from the dead.

32:03 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah.

32:06 - AcquiMatch Team
  She says that she's waiting on financials for the power washing still. So we're going to still move forward with that when she sets up a call when she gets those.  And then also on one of the costs, she mentioned that friends of her family know and a person that might be selling the business a business in her local area that she thinks is interesting.  I said, let me get on a call with that guy. I'll do all of the work. Just let just hook me up with them.  And so she said that she spoke to him and she signed an NDA and that she's going to introduce me to him.  And then I'll take it from there. So hopefully that goes through as well. Jason is still constructing an L.O.I.  for that office suites business and kind of still going through the process there. I just message them and say, hey, do you want to jump on a call so we can go over like the offer you're constructing?  So hopefully I'll be meeting him with them there. But he also said, I'm not that excited about this one.  So putting an alloy in, I think it's because he was excited about Tariq. And now he's like, because he already thought through a Tariq and now he's still involved in this one, like, I'm not as excited.  So and Tariq's not dead, we're going to revisit that in two weeks. So I'm going to jump on a call with him and see exactly where he's feeling with the crown office suites.  And then JB that last lastly, JB did the call, did the site visit, said it went well, the one owner was the two owner business, one owner was not there.  And he said he wants to meet that owner. That's the owner actually that's like more in the day to day.  so Joe's going to meet with him. tomorrow. And he said he likes it. so he's going to try to work on putting together another life for this one.  So yeah, after he does that call, me and him will regroup tomorrow. And then we'll see if he wants to start constructing another life for a second business.

34:19 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Amazing. Where is that with? I guess get a good check from him, which one he likes more when he looking for something else because Pina is dragging his feet on the financial statements or.

34:39 - AcquiMatch Team
  He says this one sounds like a little bit more fun. And he said like he can literally just move their warehouse to like right by him.  So he can like work very close to his house. And so he's like this one just seems kind of exciting.  And so I was like, OK, I see you're excited about that. I was like, well, it excites me about Pino's essential business, the fact that you can get this business.  And there's just endless people that need help. I was going to buy a business, I would buy something like that, right?  I would buy something essential where I just get to be passionate about business, not the niche itself. And I just got this constant to me.  then I can just try to out-compete my competitors and focus on service and that kind of stuff. So I would tell him, I like that about it.  And he's like, yeah, I do like that about it. But this other one's a playground business, where they kind of do installations of the floor mats for playgrounds.  And he just thinks it's cool. He's like, it's unique. Who else is doing this? They have these contracts with Chick-fil-A, where they're doing it for all over the country.  I like that. So it's cool. And he said he's going to, after this other call, he's going to try to write them down side by side and mean him.
  ACTION ITEM: Call Pino (seller). Check status, build rapport. Explore reasons for "vacation", selling motivations. - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/236755845?timestamp=2157.9999

35:59 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  We're going to discover. Okay. Um, any word from JQ seller?

36:08 - AcquiMatch Team
  No, um, send a follow up email today for that seller.

36:15 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Um, thought you were going to try calling them. On Wednesday.

36:22 - AcquiMatch Team
  Yeah. Yeah. I just had like a fully booked day and I didn't want to try to squeeze it in between other things and like try to brush them in and off the call.  So it's just trying to figure out a good strategy to go about it. Also, I was like, if I do cold call me, willing to talk.  I was trying to think of like how I come at it. Um, he's like, I'm on vacation. So I'm like, I was just trying to brainstorm how to handle it.  But. That's on the top of my list of things to do.

36:54 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So we canceled again last minute because he's on vacation or did he give you that was the reason?

37:00 - AcquiMatch Team
  That's. be said.

37:03 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Has he told Justin that doesn't sound like it's just then just asking me what's going on. He's trying to get it out of a broker or something.  It's weird just going vacation last minute like that when you're in the middle of negotiating the final points on a deal.

37:39 - AcquiMatch Team
  Yeah, I think it's weird too.

37:41 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  I would always play dumb. Call him up tomorrow. Do you have like 30 minutes when you could call him tomorrow?

37:48 - AcquiMatch Team
  I was just kind of prioritizing my things for tomorrow. like, I can call him tomorrow.

37:54 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  I just give him a call and then just be like, Oh, didn't really, you know, if he's like, I'm on vacation and be like, Oh, my gosh, didn't realize he was.  still vacation. whatever, really played, um, just be like, um, I just wanted to make sure that we had a chat with you and that we could, you know, support you sounded like things got a little heated.  How are you doing? Go from there, you know, like something, something human. But I would just be call him and just be like, I know we missed each other.  I wanted to just see how you're doing. It sounded like things got a little tough there.

38:31 - AcquiMatch Team
  Got it.

38:33 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Go from there. Like, I mean, if he answers the phone, and if he's like, I'm on vacation and just be like, oh, gosh, I didn't realize you were so vacationed like five minutes.  I just wanted to check on you and see how you're doing. I know things got weird there for a minute to see if he's ever been talking.  Anyway, like he's trying to sell his  business. it was the final moment of the conversation. He got in touch with you to ask if there's any other sellers and then he's just magically on vacation almost.  said, didn't tell Justin that.

39:05 - AcquiMatch Team
  Yeah, I'm trying to get a broker as he ran it down the explet.

39:09 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Did they have exclusive? Did they even have anything for exclusivity right now? They didn't did they? Because they never signed an L.Y.

39:18 - AcquiMatch Team
  Yeah, they never had an L.Y.

39:21 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  That's another reason, right? So like Justin spent all this time and this nothing is stopping this guy from going getting a broker.

39:37 - AcquiMatch Team
  Yeah. The good thing is, I think I built a good relationship with him. And I think that shows because he emailed me exactly.

39:48 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah. I guess I'm just saying like from Pinoside or protecting Justin, you know, David for reference, Justin was our very first client and he we sent him this deal.  So we weren't involved with the Uh, the process of Justin decided to go into an asset purchase agreement when we wouldn't have recommended that he did that.  Like, he's skipping quite a few steps doing that. Now it's put him in a really tough spot. Um, so we can give you fill in more of the details later, but we're trying to help this one even though he's not a client anymore because he was our first client.  None of us would be here if it wasn't for him. Um, so yeah, I, I, I don't think he would have reached out to you if something weird is going on.  Like my spidey sense is telling me he's not on vacation. So I would just try to give him a call and be like, Hey, how you doing?  I'm checking on you. I know it got weird, like, you're so good at being human with people that it might get him to open up and, you know, like you can even say like, just, you know, to see how I can help because I know what you were keen on selling.  Wanted to talk it through, talk through some options with you, see where you're at, see how I can help

41:00 - AcquiMatch Team
  out. Right. Yep. I'll go with that.

41:08 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah. And if he doesn't answer, you can always send a text like, Hey, it's right. You like, I don't know if he knows your number of like, Hey, it's Ryan.  I'm just checking on you. want to see if you're doing okay, you know, or whatever man speak is for that.  communicate a little bit differently. But what? Oh my God. I'm using these like sales scripts from like a very masculine dude right now.  And Anka and I are both like, I'm uncomfortable.

41:39 - David R
  literally had to like talk by them.

41:42 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Like, okay, just said, just said, you know, like, couldn't get the messages done. And I've done it. And he's like, do you want to get on a call?  Like, what the  it works? Like, I don't know what I would say ever. But you know, so whatever, whatever your version of  Like, what on you are you okay? You know?

42:09 - AcquiMatch Team
  Yeah, I was going to say, guys, oh, this is for you guys for getting a little guy five. I telling at the end, been around a lot of men in business and like when I started like doing calls at the end, watching out how she talks to clients.  was just like, I've never heard someone talk to people like this.

42:35 - David R
  it gives her style and how she does things.

42:38 - AcquiMatch Team
  she's talking about, she's like trying to learn man stuff, but if you live in the way she speaks on these calls, like there's a lot of good stuff you've probably never heard before because she's original.

42:55 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  I'll take that as a compliment at original.

42:58 - David R
  like being original.

43:03 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  I learned this a couple years ago and I rolled my eyes because it's such a woo thing, but like I'm an empath and just highly, highly perceptive of emotions and energies and where people are at and how they're doing to a fault sometimes because I can really like pick up on somebody's mood and they might just be grumpy about something, but I'm like, something's wrong, you know, but the more I tapped in, like from a business consulting, we're humans, right?  like Renan was talking about, I can't imagine you make business decisions in this way when you're considering like taking your life versus all of my needs are met, I'm paying for my real as much as we'd like to think we can compartmentalize and take things out or...  fears that come up at different points. So you Luke started this, but David, you'll hear us talk about this a lot.  Well, when we discuss these deals as a team and we realize, hey, this client's done this thing multiple times.  I'm like, it's probably because they're afraid, right? And they're doing this thing because they're afraid and don't even realize it.  And then we bring this like emotional intelligence into what we do because people are putting their house on the line.  They're putting their family on the line. They're hearing stories like we're not on. Of course, they're going to do weird and wonderful things when they're staring down the barrel of something like that.  know, but they don't realize it. And we have an opportunity to like look at the human side of things or on the seller or the broker element as well.  You know, these brokers are up against it with hundreds of yahoos like Josh, Josh shared something like they commented on my like broker thing today.  And he was like, I had somebody get on the phone. I hadn't even signed an NDA.

45:00 - AcquiMatch Team
  asking me all this confidential information and then telling me they wanted to put an offer in with 60% seller finance and then tell me I'm not going to get a better offer anywhere else on a 1.25 million dollar even business you know it's like like there's crazy people out there but anyways I'll stop running I know we're at time thank you Ryan and then just one more thing yeah I introduced that business to CM and then I reached out to the the sellers today and I have a call with them next week Tuesday where I'm going to like tell them what this will look like and stuff so and then we're going to do a call we're going to do a call where Chris gets to meet them and then Chris actually is going I think it's this weekend to Dominican Republic for like a meet-up with I remember what group is maybe action academy of the action academy and he said he's going to talk to  People there to try to get additional investors for this real estate because the real estate is 10 million So he's like, I'm going to see if I can get other people interested in maybe Coming on helping with the real estate portion.  So which may I feel like makes them even a better Potential buyer for this. So it's cool. Oh, yeah Remind him too.

46:20 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  We pay referral fees if he sends anyone our way because like he was a referral from Joe We paid you a referral fee for Chris.  So um But that's that's good like the two action academy members are like get looking at off market Good off market deals Yeah, that is Chris likes them and he's going the Dominican it might be worth like telling him To think about stopping in New York, right Okay Yeah, I thought yeah Yeah, well, I I said let's do a couple all

47:00 - AcquiMatch Team
  of calls, and then I think because the size of what this is going to be, it's probably going to go there and do a visit.  he's, and he agrees. Yeah, I think I would want to do that. So that's good.

47:16 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Well, exciting. Nice work. I can't wait to hear how that one goes. This is the, this is one that's been in Ryan's books for a long time, and we didn't have a person for it, so.

47:28 - AcquiMatch Team
  Yeah, put it all. going to put everything I got to this one and see what happens.
  ACTION ITEM: Follow up w/ broker re software dev biz. Get details: customer concentration, contract nature, selling reasons, project vs ongoing work. - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/236755845?timestamp=2849.9999

47:32 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, nice work. Cool. Luke, did you have anything you wanted to talk about today?

47:40 - Luke Gillespie
  One question for when there's a heavy client customer concentration risk on a business.

47:46 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Is it the forgivable seller know that you used to diversify that away? Yeah, so what we did with Lindsey and Kevin was, so David Lindsay and Kevin are, um, when's  She's face popped up for a minute. She was a blonde that was on the call today. Her and her husband, Kevin, bought two businesses that we found them.  The first one was a media and marketing agency. So Kevin is the owner of that one. And then Ryan found a landscaping business for WYSI.  So they each have their own business that they run, but they do it together.

48:24 - David R
  Great.

48:25 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So yeah, this is super cool. Because we didn't expect them to do that. We thought they were just going to buy one.  So for their media buying company, their biggest customer, I think accounted for like 30% of their revenue or 35% of their revenue.  So they didn't start having the forgivable conversation immediately, right? they developed the relationship. went and they drove down San Antonio multiple times from Austin, which is an hour and a half away.  develop the relationship. And that was the one they had to go to seven different lenders on, but we helped them structuring it by saying, well, if we were to look, if there's one, well, how much is there just one customer concentration issue on that thing that you're looking at?

49:21 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah, but it's pretty large.

49:24 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  How much?

49:25 - Luke Gillespie
  It was 60%, and he says it's going up to 75%, even though in the system, it said it was going down to 50%, but that's what the broker told me on the call.

49:34 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  What kind of business?

49:35 - Luke Gillespie
  SaaS.

49:44 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  How do they have one software development? So it's SaaS or it's a development agency?

49:56 - Luke Gillespie
  No, yeah, it's SaaS, but they do software development, and they do a couple different things, it's kind of really technical for me to understand I should do some more research and understanding it.  But yeah, it's just this one client. But they did have just signed a new contract for two years and there's minimums in place.

50:12 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  This is what the broker has told me. That's so it's asked to me and Brian knows better than I do.  But it's asked to me is like it's recurring revenue and it's a subscription based software.

50:26 - Luke Gillespie
  That's right. I'm sorry. I'm it's more software development.

50:29 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah. Okay, so they're an agency.

50:32 - Luke Gillespie
  Exactly.

50:32 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Software development for clients. They do have contracts in place with those clients. How long are they contracts for?

50:39 - Luke Gillespie
  They just signed a new one with this one for two years. And there's minimums intact apparently and it's it's not a fortune 500 company.  The broker says but it is a large private company as well he says.

50:50 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay. And then the development are these are these projects or is it like ongoing servicing?

50:57 - Luke Gillespie
  This private company is basically instead of having their an in-house software development team, they're basically just outsourcing their software development to this company.

51:07 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So this company, they just do this custom software development of whatever this customer wants from them. Okay, so the reason why I was asking is like if it's ongoing maintenance of stuff, right, then that is the potential long-term relationship even beyond the contract versus is it a project based, they're just doing specific projects for this person, in which case that person might not need any work done after the project is completed.  So you kind of hearing where I'm going with that?

51:43 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah, I get what you're saying. I'm just assuming if it's a two-year contract, that means it's recurring, or they're going to be doing multiple projects.

51:52 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Not necessarily. So what you want to look into is how long has this person been a customer? And are they likely to continue to  be a customer after that contract is over? Is there anything that makes them irreplaceable where this person would want to continue signing the contract?  Now, in Lindsay's and Kevin's business, a media buying agency is someone that continues to buy your, so they're going out and deciding where they're going to buy advertisements, and they place those advertisements for that client.  So it's something that if it's working for their marketing, right, like if whatever Lindsay and Kevin's company is doing over time is delivering value to that client, there's no reason for the client to switch agencies because they need that over and over and over again.  They're always going to need to buy more media, more advertisement, as long as what Lindsay and Kevin's company is doing is delivering value over time and going to continue to be that way.  It's different than project-based work, right? Project is like I am so for example, I am hiring someone to make a financial modeling template for us.  Yeah, I don't necessarily need this dude after this template is done as opposed to I want to outsource or I want to bring due diligence in house and we do due diligence and I have these outsourced companies that I keep giving work to over and over because we're always going to have clients that need a diligence.

53:30 - Luke Gillespie
  Sense the difference there. Yeah, no, I understand.

53:33 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So that being said, the reason why they were able to make the customer concentration a forgivable note and get the banks comfortable with it is because this customer had been a customer for 20 years and was likely going to be a customer afterwards and they did a forgivable note.  So the customer was like 30% of the business so they didn't offer based on if that customer didn't exist, and we only had this revenue from all of the other customers, what kind of offer could we make?  And then on top of that, they were able to offer a forgivable performance-based note based on the amount that that customer brought in on revenue, and they're like, as long as that customer stays for the next two years, then we will pay you this additional money, which we can only pay as long as that customer stays.

54:33 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah, I understand.

54:36 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So in this case, it sounds like what you said, and again, you give me a five-second overview, so you all can talk about it amongst yourselves now that you understand the difference between potential to be ongoing clients versus a one-time project that this person is never gonna need again.  But it doesn't open up the opportunity for what, you know, Renan was talking about, like, significantly. in amount of seller financing.  So if this person is like, well, I can help you diversify or get additional clients or this person is going to stay on, we'll then prove it.  And we can only get financing in so much as what is there and diversified. But if you're only getting work from this client, well, how much work have you gotten in the past?  How likely are they going to be able to sign on work in the future? If this is 70% of the revenue and they only have a two-year contract and this like this client is likely not going to come back for any more, that business is going to drop by 70% two years.

55:37 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah, that answer your question. Yeah, I get it. After reviewing it, I always come up with more questions, you know, and I want to know more about the client and kind of who they are, more details about the contract.  So that's good. I'll go back to the broker and ask him. This is like my number three write up for Jason.  I already have two in front of them. but one of those two I kind of want to give to Andrew when I was going to talk to Ryan about that tomorrow but yeah so I might lower the priority of this right up.

56:09 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Well I mean Jason being a software developer that in itself is like that makes it a very different situation for him right so he he actually knows how to do and has direct industry experience and would be able to look at you know so what I want to know is not just how long the contract is but what's the history with this client what what is the nature of the contract what is the likelihood that that contract would be renewed what is the type of work that they're doing is it project-based is it recurring is it like you know something that it's like we can't live without you in the future and it would be very painful for us to have to change agencies or to change this process you know.

57:04 - Luke Gillespie
  I'll do some further due diligence.

57:08 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Cool. Any other questions? is good. You're coming up with the right questions, right? So that's what's important is you're picking up on the right things and it gives you an opportunity to explore.  What does it actually mean? So, like, your instincts are good. pick up on the right things and then you get to dig into it a little bit deeper because our clients might not.  They're like, contracts for two years. It's great. Well, if it's a one-off thing and this person's never going to come back to us again, like, think, how are we going to replace and diversify that income over time?  It might not be eligible for SBA. In which case, this guy might have to take a significant note in order to solve his business and, you know, a 70% performance-based note that they're going to get in there and try to help Jason or whoever get a lot of new clients.  in to diversify it so he gets paid.

58:03 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah, it's like a partnership to brothers and the one brother who's the technical one, the engineer, he's going to stay on, he wants to stay on, and then the one brother who's more just doing the operations and running the business is going to leave.  Jason would be coming in kind of doing more of the working on the business and in the business being the businessman and they did say they kind of want to be able to drive business development, sales, sort of, and so that's that's that's the situation.  Yeah, the guy says this other engineer, not your typical nerdy, shy guy, he's like talkative and funny and I was like, oh, so is my engineer Jason and so that's why I'm liking this business because I know Jason probably doesn't want to be getting too technical with it.  I'm sure in his current position like senior software engineer leader at his company's probably not getting too technical, he's more just leading people, so I thought it could be good.

58:55 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Is it a partial sale or is the selling everything?

58:59 - Luke Gillespie
  It's listed for For full asking price for everything, but he said the guy would probably be open and rolling over some equity.  It's very open. You know, it's not, not any strict requirements.

59:08 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay, well, looks like he has more work to do in exploring what exactly is the nature of those contracts, but sounds like it could be interesting for Jason.

59:18 - Luke Gillespie
  Yep. Yep.

59:21 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Why are they selling?

59:24 - Luke Gillespie
  Um, because the, the one brother wants to get out of it. And then the other brother, why though? Oh, cause he just doesn't like it.  He doesn't want to be doing the business part of things, business development, sales and writing the business is, uh, he just like isn't enjoying it.  That's a flag. Okay.

59:43 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Is he not enjoying it? it's not going well.

59:48 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah, I don't know. I forgot the brocrans exact words. I haven't fully reviewed the call and notes and everything yet, because I just did the call like right before buyers, but this is, this is a something.

1:00:00 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  like to be absolutely like spidey sense about is the reason for selling and feels often fall apart or get canceled because the owner's not actually ready to sell.

1:00:19 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah.

1:00:21 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Or they're trying to sell because they are trying to get out of a burning house, you know. So it's something for you to very curiously explore as much as possible to try to understand what's going on there, especially if you're talking to the broker, you know, if they're like, Oh, no, no.  I mean, they've taken this person on so they've hopefully done some vetting, but if the broker is taking whatever they can get and hoping that they get something enticing enough in front of this person to convince them to sell, that is a different story than somebody's like, I have my little honey.  in Florida, I am going there next year. I want to get out of here. I want to retire, right?  So like the reason for selling is something to get curious and like put your spidey sense up about and like keep asking questions in a different way, you know?  Like if they're like, ah, they're glossing over it, like red flag, right? They don't like it. What do they like about it?

1:01:22 - Luke Gillespie
  You know, how long have they been doing it? Like, what are they not liking it?

1:01:26 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Because it's not going well? Because they have one customer that accounts for 70%. Customers are  nightmare. why don't they like it?

1:01:34 - Luke Gillespie
  Gets in here in a nightmare customer that like this person wants to leave their own business because they don't like it.  Yeah. And I ran into another business today. I did a call for for Andrew. it's like, you can just tell that these sellers, they're not even really set on selling.  They're kind of just flirting just to see what they can get. so I'm not pushing.

1:01:54 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  First tire kick in.

1:01:56 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah, I'm not pushing that for Andrew yet. I'm following the broker called notes. So it's yeah. The technical guy, he loves what he's doing, and he's happy to continue on.  He says the other brother, he doesn't have the technical background, and he doesn't think he's suited. He was just brought on to help his brother, and I think he wants to go into real estate and other projects, is what the notes say.  Yeah.

1:02:18 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So, I like to, like, what we don't want to do is put things in front of people, and we haven't, like, if there's a flight risk, you know, we didn't identify that first, like, then, you know, just play these down the track.  It's like, we're not just putting right ups in front of people, we're putting, like, good, direct, likely to close hits in front of them.  So, it's an opportunity for us to, like, explore the edges of discomfort, right? Like, but why, why, why don't they like it, you know?

1:02:53 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah. Uh-huh. Yeah.

1:02:57 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So, the more flavor that we can give and be like, hey, even sell, I'm going to get way more money.  Or they realize whatever left isn't enough to, you know, the nest egg to retire. It's, it's not what they thought it was going to be.  So the, like, if they're not dead set on selling because they, like, want to get out of the business, then those things coming up can make them want to hang on to it.

1:04:21 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah, good one.

1:04:24 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  And, or, like I said, house fire, right? how about I be  going wrong? Like, if we're not trying to sell his business, when he was only getting like five leads in four or five months, like, there's a reason he's trying to sell right now because it's like, it's going bad, and it's not going good.

1:04:41 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah, yeah.

1:04:44 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Um, you're doing everything right. Just another opportunity to give you some insight into stuff, which is why we do these meetings.  nice work. Sounds like we're good. We're in a good place, anything else I should know before I let y'all go.  Sorry for keeping you so late.

1:04:58 - Luke Gillespie
  I got a really good IT business for good. So he can run it from his laptop. Yeah.

1:05:02 - AcquiMatch Team
  So I would say the only thing, additional note is that we did those two write-ups for DL. One of the businesses, the plumbing business, there was an LOI and submitted it and accepted before we even got them on the broker call.

1:05:27 - Luke Gillespie
  So it was accepted, did he say that?

1:05:30 - AcquiMatch Team
  That's what he said, they accepted an LOI.

1:05:34 - Luke Gillespie
  Did DL tell you that or did the broker?

1:05:37 - AcquiMatch Team
  That's what the broker call email said.

1:05:40 - Luke Gillespie
  No, he said they received an LOI, but he's still open to meeting with them. And they were planning on still meeting with him.  I'm trying to find the email.

1:05:49 - AcquiMatch Team
  Oh, I thought it said. Oh, god.

1:05:56 - Luke Gillespie
  Maybe I wasn't TCD on that email.

1:05:58 - AcquiMatch Team
  Uh-huh. He said one.

1:06:04 - Luke Gillespie
  yeah you're trying to meet with him on Friday. They're supposed to meet, it says tomorrow. Uckin, but that means they signed it under the contract.  Yeah.

1:06:21 - AcquiMatch Team
  So anyway, like Luke talked, he told Luke that we were the first ones to inquire about the business. One thing bad on my part is that he gave me the write up and it took me a day to review it.  Right. you know, if I would have reviewed it right when he sent it, I could have done it quicker.  Something I've thought about Luke's another one today is I can review this. I said, give it to him like I don't.  I don't want to hold things up. Yeah, I was a bummer that happened. Even if we would have gotten like.  like immediately.

1:07:01 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah, still, the thing is that they're not going to submit no on a plumbing business that's two years old within that time frame.

1:07:07 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  It's just that's not going to happen, right?

1:07:09 - AcquiMatch Team
  So it's still bummer to get a client a write up and it go under offer before they get a chance to kind of do do the work.  So yeah, I was talking with Anka.

1:07:20 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  And like, that's almost a negative one for kind of minimums when that happens, right? Like, if they don't even get a chance at it, and I don't think it's, it's, it's considered a viable write up for them.
  ACTION ITEM: Prioritize deal hunting for DL. Find solid opportunities to make up for missed plumbing biz. - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/236755845?timestamp=4045.9999  So go ahead.

1:07:35 - AcquiMatch Team
  Go ahead. No, no, no, Carrie, I'm just going to say, so since we got to show all your, you know, I'd say David Lok priority is put, put DL on there in terms of hunting, whatever we got to do, let's try to really get them something solid makeup for that.  Yeah, it's a lot of other stuff.

1:07:57 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah, that's what we have is our priorities right now. Yeah. Yeah, don't we don't be yourself up about the pulling this too much Ryan because we never have a bottle neck of waiting for you to review things because normally Ryan doesn't review them we just send them out but this one just because it's the first one we were having Ryan look at it first because Ryan's going to do it on a call with with DL right so it's it's just because it was the first one so it did the process a little different than normal.

1:08:24 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Well I think it's worth looking at like not at David's here and I know it's only his first week but the throughput of everyone right because when we run around from deal to deal like we're the bottlenecks I'm hearing there's like 60 Sims right now that need to be reviewed all those could be really great deals but if we're if we're lapsing on time because we're like oh we need to focus on this person this person rather than like how are we quickly getting those two people as quickly as possible for everyone and this isn't at Luke I know you're doing everything  you can. It's just an example of the Sims building at, there might be really valuable deals in there for other clients that if we're not reviewing them as soon as we get them on our desk, all of that time that's lapsing is time that somebody else could be getting those businesses under offer.  So for, it's why you hear me hammer on about throughput, throughput, throughput, right? by producing bottlenecks and not running around having to firefight.  So hopefully David, you'll be able to help us with this by like getting us much better, just steady flow for all of the clients, but then also looking at how are we at each of those different stages processing things as quickly as possible for everything coming through so that we're able to get things to people quicker.  Because on market, it is just going to get more and more and more competitive. And I was just at an event where there was 90 freaking searchers there in Miami where Dustin and Lindsey are like there's  a lot of them there, maybe arguably even more than Austin. Tampa is just up the road where SM bootcamp is hosted, know, there's like a big search or community.  So what can we do to help our clients be as competitive as possible by getting things to them as quickly as possible.  Ryan, I appreciate you, know, taking responsibility for taking time to review, but also that's what we want to do with the clients.  We want to get on with them on the first one and that's going to take some time. So the quicker we can like spot things, grab them, process them, get them through, across the board for everybody, the better chance we have of giving them a real shot at these things.  And then on market is a very different play than off market. And that's why the importance of like what's the competition looking like on this, know, we know plumbing HVAC all of the go.  So we're not having those conversations on broker calls like how many. Why did you get on this one, you know, instead of saying what's a competition?  Like they're always going to tell you it's competitive. You can even be like, yeah, you know, Athena is saying like, she's hearing from brokers are getting like 200 inquiries the first hour and they'll be like, Oh, I didn't get anything like that.  And they'll be like, yeah, I was crazy, you know. So like, you can just make conversation, but get into that way and find out what the competition looks like in different ways to be able to be like, y'all need to move on this like, immediately, if you like it, get your LOI together now, right?  Because an LOI is like, I'm serious, I'm a contender. And unfortunately, we don't have the time to build the owner relationship, like we do off market.  So it's, it's helping them manage their strategy and their timings. And when we're dealing with first-time buyers who have W2s, they think they're moving fast, but they are not, right?

1:11:54 - AcquiMatch Team
  Right.

1:11:57 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So y'all are doing great. David, we're You know, no pressure, but we're really excited to have you here so we can try to manage this throughput and just, you know, so we're steadily putting things through for everybody rather than having to run around.  But yeah, we want to get DL off to a good start and then Justin search starts March so like how can we get ahead of that get Justin some really good things because he is in all the business buying communities and they're asking him about us because they know he's the only Austin client.  I am right now right like they all know that we don't we don't take more than one Austin client at a time so they're asking him and.  You know somebody else it's like referring potential people to us is like, but just so they're all important though that's the thing I want us to get to the point where we're not saying who the priority client is they're all a priority.  Yeah, and we'll get there y'all I believe in you so you know David hopefully it was a missing piece for us to get to that point.

1:13:00 - David R
  I'll do my best.

1:13:01 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  No pressure. You'll get my sense of humor hopefully over time too, but I know everybody's doing the best they can, but I like to shine lights and where we can all work as a team.  one of the things I'm going to keep hammering on is the off-market stuff, right?

1:13:23 - David R
  Because it just alleviates the pressure on market, especially when it's like soul freaking competitive.

1:13:29 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Like we buy them time by getting these other opportunities in front of them that don't have 200 inquiries on hour one and a million different L.O.I.s before somebody's even because there's people out there like Elliott Holland.  It's telling people to send 10 L.O.I.s a week like before even meeting the  cell it's crazy. And so these brokers see dollar signs and there's these  tactics of like sending an L.O.I.  offering all cash and then getting it under offer and being like just kidding we're getting debt, know?

1:14:00 - Luke Gillespie
  So like...

1:14:00 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  They're shady  happening out there and the less reliance we can have on the market, the better we're setting that up for success because it gives them the time to develop those relationships and really spend their time on deals, but we need more of those opportunities coming through to do that.

1:14:19 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah, yeah.

1:14:21 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  On-market sucks. mean, it's great to have a broker involved if there's not like a shitload of competition, but if it's competitive, it sucks.

1:14:33 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah.

1:14:35 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Anyways, I'll keep you all much later. We're super over time. Thank you for bearing with me. I thought Renan was absolutely fascinating.  Anything else I can help with before we sign off? Otherwise I'll let you guys get to your evenings and I'll see you in all the tea meetings tomorrow.

1:14:51 - AcquiMatch Team
  Sounds good.

1:14:53 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Nice work and welcome, David. Thank you. That's very, it's very, yeah.

1:15:03 - David R
  Amazing.

1:15:04 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Cool. Friday is my favorite day because it's Team Day. don't know how these all, these guys feel about it being on calls with me all day, but it's my favorite day.  So we'll see you in the team meeting tomorrow. And I know you've got other stuff that you're working on.  And Ryan and Luke, thank you for all you're doing to get great deals in front of people. We're having a lot of movement.  We didn't have this kind of movement last year, right? So just reminded people are making offers, they're modeling things or even Steven Polly are modeling things and thinking about L.O.I.

1:15:33 - Luke Gillespie
  is like, it's incredible. Yep. It's gonna get better with David.

1:15:38 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
