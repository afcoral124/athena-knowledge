**Athena:** Hello? Hello?

Hello. 

**Athena:** Hey girl. How's it going? 

All right. Yourself? 

**Athena:** I'm really great. Thank you. Good. Awesome. Looked like we had, there's Andrew. Oh, good. I was, uh, I was hoping you joined. Are you feeling comfortable talking about what just happened or you wanna wait? 

**Andrew:** I don't know. I, I don't know what just happened. 

**Athena:** Okay. Uhoh?

**Andrew:** No, it was fine. It was fine. It was fine. It was fine. I'm happy to, I'm happy to. 

**Athena:** If, if you want, 'cause obviously this is, I'm, I'm, I'm on, but I don't wanna put you on the spot too, but this is, this is a, a safe space. So Andrew's been working on a, a big thing, so we get an update. And then, um, Justin, I was maybe gonna pick on you too, if you wanna give an update at some point if you're feeling comfortable with that.

Um, and then I was just at S and Bash, so if we have some time, I was gonna share some, some insights from that too. Uh, nothing major, just. [00:01:00] Some, some things that I thought were interesting, but yeah. Andrew, how did it go? 

**Andrew:** Um, it went well. Um, he was, you know, fortunately the, the seller on this deal is a, a good guy, and him and I kind of hit, hit, hit it off in general.

So I think he knows I'm coming from a good place. Um, and I'm sure he could tell that. The nerves that I had leading up to it, which probably if, if I were him, would make me feel more comfortable one way or the other if I saw somebody else that was nervous about it. So, because if you're not nervous, that means just, you know, you probably don't care as much.

So anyways, it, it went fine. Um, it went fine. He, he took notes, went through it. He did ask for something a little bit more formalized, so we had something tangible to work through, which I. Totally get and somewhat expected. 

Yep. 

**Andrew:** Um, so I told him I was gonna work on that. Um, but he definitely, you know, we left the call saying, and he was like, I definitely feel like we've got [00:02:00] something to work to move forward with.

Um, so I think it was better than, it wasn't bad. He didn't, he definitely had a, he didn't have a reaction, but he definitely said, you know, what, he, his expect expectation levels were definitely higher. Uh, but he even had himself. He was on a flight yesterday. He told me he had had a kind of a, a, oh, uh, uh, just thinking about like he kind of had a session in his brain.

I guess just trying to think about different scenarios and where, what he would be feeling if he were me in kind of the world that we're in right now, which is kind of a big question mark. Um, for a lot of reasons. Um. So he is like, if I were in your shoes, like that's probably about where I'd be too. So I totally get it.

You know? And so he, he's very respectful and he can tell that I was trying to be respectful and it, it went fine, you know, it went fine. We'll see how it goes. 

**Athena:** That's better than fine. It wasn't [00:03:00] enough. So it sounds like the, the numbers threw out. There was a, some sort of acceptance and I wanna review it kind of thing, or was it like, was there back and forth on the numbers?

Like how did. 

**Andrew:** There wasn't back and forth. I don't think he had enough information to be back and forth on it yet. Um, and I kind of walked through exactly where I was, where I was, you know, and said, here's what the, this is the option that you don't really have any irons in the fire. You're just getting a check.

Um, I'd rather you have an iron in the fire, you know, and have some degree of performance based or nos. Um, and I think he, I think he agrees with that. I think him and I are similarly minded. In that regard. And I think if he, um, yeah, I just think there's some alignment there. And so I, I have a pretty good feeling that there, there's, I don't think it's gonna be crazy strong.

I think he's definitely gonna wanna bump the price up. How much? I don't know. I think he's a lot more open to seller financing now after having gotten to know [00:04:00] me. 

Mm-hmm. More. Mm-hmm. 

**Andrew:** Um, 'cause he didn't, I kind of thought that he was gonna have an adverse reaction 'cause I was, you know, 45% and he did not bulk at that.

At least visually 

**Athena:** attached to performance metrics too. So, um, that's awesome. This is great. That's good. You know, like, 

yeah. 

**Athena:** You kind of wanna land on a number that both people are a little bit disappointed about, right? With working capital and purchase price, because then it doesn't feel like anyone's getting screwed over in that regard.

So, um, yeah. 

**Andrew:** Well, and I, I, you know, you had said it best and I had said it to him too, like, Hey, like, I'm not. I'm not hiring a CEO to come run this thing. I'm the guy, I'm, you know, the good old boy from Oklahoma is gonna be running the ship. Like I'm not, I'm not private equity. You can go get private equity funds and maybe that makes more sense for you.

I'm okay with that. I can respect that. If you don't want [00:05:00] that, I'm your guy. So I was in a better position to be able to go and tell him that and be, be honest about it, you know, because I'm not my, uh. I want this deal, but my life's not going to end if this deal doesn't happen. Right. So I've spent enough time on it and there's risks associated with it, and I, I, I'm willing to take on those risks, but only to a certain point.

So I feel like it's in a good position. 

**Athena:** Excellent. And did you lead into it? Outlining all the risks like we talked about. Like, hey, mm-hmm. There's this, there's this, there's it. So for the benefit of the other folks listening, I think this is really good to hear it. Like literally just got off the call and, and the entry was, Hey, I see this is a risk.

I see this is a risk. I see this is a risk. I see this is a risk and therefore that's how I arrived at this number. 'cause dude, I'm putting my family's livelihood on the line. Was it kind of like that? 

**Andrew:** Yeah, it was, I probably could have been a little bit more on, uh, on not criticism [00:06:00] of his, not criticism, but kind of feedback on his business.

I, I put a lot of it more on me. 'cause I, I've, the, I've gotten a really good call for what kind of drives this guy and I think there is a lot of emotional tied to it. So I was really leaning heavy heavily on that, which is all factual. Like, Hey, I'm gonna sign a big dotted line that says personal guarantee, and this is gonna totally wipe out my family at Bico South.

Full stop. You know, I've gotta, I've gotta be making decisions based off of that. And so I said, Hey, we're walking into this trans, we're walking into this talking about numbers. I want you to know that I'm coming from a place of covering my bases, so I've gotta take care of my family. The last thing I ever want to do is make anybody feel insulted.

So know that I'm coming from a place of good faith and I hope we can work something out. 

**Athena:** Excellent. Fantastic. And, um, that's a, you know, so. When you all get to the point of negotiation, like reminding people what's on the line for you. Mm-hmm. Like Andrew just pointed out, make some, [00:07:00] like, this is not like some fund, you know?

Yeah. This isn't, this isn't a random investor. This isn't private equity. Like reminding these folks what you are putting on the line and these are all, you know, they all have families. And they're business owners and they understand that because if been a business owner, and that's like what you're doing on a daily basis is like putting everything on the line so they can connect with that.

So this is a one of those big moments like. To, to, to really demonstrate what's your weakness is actually your strength in that moment, because they're gonna connect a hell of a lot more with you. The person with a family to support that's putting it all on the line than some fancy finance person that, you know, it's like, it's, it's a wash to them whether this deal works out or not.

Like, 'cause they've been putting it on the line since they started this business, so. Mm-hmm. Awesome there. And I love what you did, and I also wanna call this out. Like actually telling him like, [00:08:00] I could buy your business or anyone else's business, you know, it's like, I'm gonna buy a business. But that anchoring the loss in their head is a really effective tool because this guy has one business to sell.

And although everybody here is, is, you know, motivated, wants to buy something, like you have choices and they do not, you know, they have one business to sell. You all can buy any number of businesses, and although it might take you time, you're willing to wait for the right thing. So if you like this business.

This is a, such a great fit from everything that we're hearing for your skillset and every, it's like so exciting. Um, so it's a great fit, but at the end of the day, Andrew's not, Andrew's got a family to, you know, look after and like all of these things. So he's like, I can, I can walk away from this deal.

Like, that is so powerful in these negotiations, even though it feels like you don't wanna walk away and it's like, this is the one, I don't [00:09:00] wanna lose it. Right. But like. That was awesome. I'm, I wanna pull that out because everybody's gonna be in the negotiation seat soon, you know, or at some point, so.

**Andrew:** Well, and like you said to I, me, you have to be o be okay with the, you know, either option and, you know, I'm, I'm sitting in a play. It almost like it could be construed as like a non excitement. It's not necessarily that, but there's some legitimate, like, risks associated with this. It is a good business.

It's not very old. It's not proprietary. The, the baseline. I mean, there's a lot of things, you know, it's Canadian based. It's not a US company. You know, there's a lot of, there's a lot of hair and it's going to take, you know, if it's not a win, it's just not a win. I, and I, I've, I'm okay with that. If it doesn't end up happening and it's, it doesn't fit his number, that's fine.

I, I honestly feel like he, I honestly feel if we get to that position, I think he's gonna call me in a couple months anyways. 

**Athena:** Mm-hmm. Yeah, because he, he straight 

**Andrew:** up said he, he wanted a five x. Like, there's just no, I mean, I didn't say anything with him. I'm like, there's just, [00:10:00] there's no way, no way. 

**Athena:** Yeah.

Well, without proprietary, like that's, that's what gets him a higher number, like in the tech world. Right. Is like proprietary or strategic, which, who knows what they're gonna do with his team. Yeah. And his clients so 

**Andrew:** well, and he, he could get that maybe, but I don't think he wants that. He doesn't need, he's not motivated.

He obviously, he's motivated by money. Everyone's motivated by money to a certain degree, but he's made that pretty clear, like that's not what his goal is. He doesn't need a windfall. 

He's 

**Andrew:** not, he, he wants a windfall, but he's not, he's not hedging his, he's made other investments. He just wants somebody to take this fall to the next level.

**Athena:** So. The way it, so what's really exciting about this deal is because it's a Canadian business, it opens up like other financing sources, which opens up tools that we might not be able to use in SBA, which is like highly incentivizing him to grow the business with you, transition the business, um, [00:11:00] you know, affect, effect effectively, like an earnout, which we're calling a forgivable performance space note too.

And we can do either one. So you now have a starting point. You have. You have it out there, depending on what he comes back with or the points that he wants. We have so many more potential tools available. You can incentivize him if you don't use SBA, which is great, right? Like if he wants more, well cool.

Let's increase the growth rate then, and you help me. I wanna give you more if you can help me get more. Yeah. And we can prove that this works without you. Like hell yeah. Let's get you more money. If you, you know, do the things that it takes to, to get you there. So, 

**Andrew:** yeah, and he asked that. I that's, I'm glad you said that about that he asked about SBA asked and I, he asked if I had had any, and I had mentioned, I, I wasn't really prepared to talk about that, but I mentioned what you had said about, um, your connection and that like, pretty much everybody else had said no, but there was one potential guy [00:12:00] who said they might do it, but I told him what you just said is like, here's the deal.

I didn't. Open that door very wide because I, I, I think there's a pretty decent chance that that's not gonna beat, that we can explore that, but I honestly feel like we're gonna be able to find a better deal not using SBA 'cause we're not gonna have as many, um, you know, boundaries. I think we can actually make it a better, better win.

Um, but it depends on, I I told him because this is the truth. I mean, I, it depends on what he wants to do. If he wants to clean, cut base level. Seller? No, with not perform well, you know, way less performer space or not performance based at all. Great. We can do a low multiple, we can do that all day. But anything above that, it's gonna be performance based.

And I, I told Anka too, Athena, I didn't, I saw, I saw your videos. I, there's an appointment literally until 15 minutes before I started that call, and I could not. Change anything mentally before that call. So I did not get to finish the videos that you had sent. I will, [00:13:00] um, well, the, 

**Athena:** the highlights were the, all the structures we talked about yesterday were more than more than Okay.

So it was, yeah. Um, 

good. 

**Athena:** Yeah, that's good. Just wanted to give you that, that further vote of confidence. Uh, and then, and then how to use the, the increase in performance based, if you want to mess around with that. So, sounds, sounds like that's. What, what, what are you seeing as your next steps? What are you gonna do next?

**Andrew:** Um, my step next steps, I think are working on an LOI, getting that together, um, and getting that to 'em. I, I, I'm hoping I can get that knocked out this week. I really think I can. Um, I gotta dig into that, see how much time it's actually going to take me. Um, I think he needed to digest a little bit too. Um, so he, we didn't set up hard.

Expectation. I told him that I was gonna try to get that to him in the next couple days. I have a feeling that there's a chance I might hear from him before that, um, [00:14:00] on just some, I think it's all email for right now. Just give something in writing back and forth that, because he wants to talk to his wife, obviously he'd said, I'd prefer to say, I will talk to my wife about this.

We've talked about, I, you know, repeated all the numbers in US dollars and, and they can talk about. The basics basic. Like I, I'd really prefer to get her something in writing so we can kind of make, so he gave me the confidence enough to put that together. How about that? 

**Athena:** Great. Um, so I don't, I don't think it'll take you that long.

It's, you know, filling in some pieces on the LOI template, um, watch that video where they went through it. If you, if you weren't on that one or just revisit it again, I would just watch the Buyer's Club when, um, Barlow Williams go through the LOI template. 

**Andrew:** I was on my, my, the concern, the only thing I'm concerned about Athena is the performance base.

Being able to put that in language that make a, makes sense to a human being. 'cause I don't know that I can do that. Yeah. But like, I makes sense in my head. But [00:15:00] putting that into work, I said that to him too, is like, Hey. I can get you the option that is, you know, no performance base, that's easy. But I don't think that's, you know, the, the performance base is what I think is the win here.

And I've gotta really, I need to make sure I can, that's legible and understandable before I send it to you, so, 

**Athena:** absolutely. I agree. Yeah, if, if you wanna a vote of confidence, like what I would do is like, have a go at filling out the template, um, and then, you know, if you're. I would like if you who do, who do you wanna use as a lawyer for this process?

Have you decided on that? 

**Andrew:** Well, I mean, the first, I mean, really the first call I was gonna make was Williams and Barlow. 'cause they specialize in online businesses. Right. I mean that's, it seems like the logical choice. 

**Athena:** I would, I would contact them and, and talk through the fact that it's the Canadian business and see if they feel comfortable with that or if they would refer you out to someone else.

That would be okay. 'cause the next immediate thing is like. Uh, I would, I would probably want [00:16:00] you to just have somebody that has experience. I, I don't know off the top of my head if they've done Canadian businesses before. Mm-hmm. If they don't, they'll probably refer you out if they don't come to us and we'll ask our network to find out who the best person to 'cause you will, I would feel more comfortable and you can choose whether you do this or not, to get someone to do a, a pre-sign review just to make sure.

It will work on, on both ends and then they'll also review. Okay. But you can put the language together on like what you're thinking. For the performance based note, send it to us. I'll review it. So just so everybody's aware, like me and the team, we can't edit the words themselves because then that would be us getting into lawyer territory, which can get us into a lot of trouble, but we can feed back.

So you are able to make edits to your legal documents. We can comment, so we can't go in and like actually change words or anything like that. But if you send us the language, then we can give you [00:17:00] feedback overall on this might be confusing or you might wanna clean this up, or et cetera. Um, so just saying that for the benefit of the group and you, but that would be next protocol is Barlow Williams.

Do you do deals

Canadian immediately? We have a lot of great people that will be able to find us. Someone awesome to refer you to. Okay. Start filling in the LOI template. Um, and. You at least then have a document for somebody to review rather than like pulling it all from scratch, which is far less expensive. And or if Barlow Williams are like, yep, we can do it, then they already know their own template and they can give a review of it and just be like, good to go on the performance note side of things.

**Andrew:** Okay. And you think get that, I mean, I, I think the obvious answer is yes, but get that reviewed prior to sending over to their side. 

**Athena:** No, you can send it. And then when the red lines come back from him, that's when you wanna ship, that's when you wanna get lawyers [00:18:00] involved is like when people start changing language in those documents.

So they already have already given language in reference to performance based notes. I believe that's in the template. If not, um, there's something 

**Andrew:** in there for sure. Yeah, I mean, I've read it. 

**Athena:** Because I, when we put it all together, I was like, we use performance based notes. And they've done that with, um, our clients before too, putting performance based notes.

And so if it's not

Onca, I'm looking at you. Let's make sure we get with them to get the template up yourself. Alongside that check if they can support you on that. 'cause you're gonna need somebody Yeah. Pretty immediately to review it anyway. But the template as itself was designed for you all to just fill in the blanks, have us review it so then we can catch if, if you didn't fill it out correctly, and then you can, um, send it.

But then when the, the seller. Comes back and has edits to the document, that's really when you want to, you know, get a lawyer [00:19:00] involved because even though it's non-binding in terms of you purchasing the business, there are binding terms in an LOI, such as exclusivity, confidentiality, and you wanna make sure that the seller's not putting you into anything binding, that you don't want to be binding, like adding in a.

You know, earnest money or you know, et cetera, et cetera. So it's better if, if there's edits made to the document, I'm, I'm like, of the better safe than, sorry, most of the lawyers and no Barlow Williams will credit whatever they did in the review towards the actual transaction fees also. So it's, it's a, a nominal amount of money for peace of mind that you didn't like change something, uh, that, that would make you, you know, in a, a place of not.

Like a place that, like for whatever reason, if they changed compromise something where you didn't have exclusivity, it's like, oh no, you don't want them shopping it around while you're going through this process and having all that money spent. You know? 

**Andrew:** Yeah. Ten [00:20:00] four. Yeah, I'm on it. 

**Athena:** Yeah. And then so time kills all deals.

So especially when you start getting into this phase of it, again, I'm saying it for the benefit of everybody too. Um, there can be deal fatigue, so the quicker you can get things out and just feel like momentum, the more you can keep the seller on the hook. But you're both gonna get fatigued through this process.

So the quicker you can kind of get things and just feel like there's movement. 

Yeah. Right. 

**Athena:** Like I'm, I'm picturing as I say this, like a home that no one has been in at all. Like those buildings die quicker. Yeah. And they deteriorate quicker than, than life that's in them. So. You know, I kind of think of that with this process too.

Like the longer we leave things without interaction and movement, then it can feel like it's dying. 

**Andrew:** Oh, yeah. I, it can deteriorate 

**Athena:** quicker. 

**Andrew:** I know that, uh, intimately time kills deals. I get it. [00:21:00] 

**Athena:** Yeah. Well, yeah, you're involved in 'em all the time and you're involved with buildings, so I thought that was such an interesting fact when I learned it, like, oh my gosh, like a building that doesn't have people living in it.

Deteriorates way quicker. Do you know why that is? Like, is it just like the energy of not having people in it, or is there 

**Andrew:** different, mainly deferred maintenance and things like that? I mean, it's just, you know, it's like if you were gone and you're, you know, your hot water heater starts leaking, you're not gonna know better for six months and now all of a sudden that's caused, you know, instead of a $4,000 problem, that's suddenly a $20,000 problem.

You've gotta, you know, it's those things, the people factor. 

**Athena:** Yeah, people, 

**Andrew:** but 

**Athena:** Awesome. 

**Andrew:** Um, yeah, and I, I, I, I wanted to hop on here. I really apologize. I hate to like, share and then bail. I've got a three 30 appointment, but I. And, uh, tell you that I didn't like jump off the roof or anything. Yeah, I'm 

**Athena:** so, I'm so excited for you, Andrew.

Well done. That's not easy. So he flew [00:22:00] solo on this too, 'cause Ryan's away. So Andrew, Andrew did that with the seller on his own. It was awesome. Um, and it sounds like, like it wasn't a known and you got to a place where he is asking for an offer. Yeah. Let's, and celebrating this, this is great 

**Andrew:** celebration.

I'll, I'll end on. I was fortunate in this situation. I don't think that's always the case. Certainly it's not always the case. He was very gracious about everything and he like, he knew where I was coming from. He made sure to call that out. He was like, I totally understand. You've been respectful. I wanna be respectful back and blah, blah, blah.

He didn't, I didn't get a, you know, an fu face from him. And so it could just, because he's Canadian and he's a nice guy, you know, who knows? That's just a cultural thing. But, um, it was good. So, 

**Athena:** no, but this is the importance of building a relationship, building a rapport, and also matching yourself to the business.

You know, like who is he going to get that? That's like, oh, you're the face of the business. I'm confident like taking that on and [00:23:00] transitioning you out. Like there's a lot that he would not be able to do with private equity for sure. 

**Andrew:** I sold that to him too on the, on the lending. I didn't make any kind of, you know, analogy to it being difficult to find, but I said, Hey, if there's someone that can go and sell this business to a loan committee, it's me.

Um, 'cause I understand it. And so he heard that. I mean, you can read between a lines and that stuff. This isn't, this isn't a cookie cutter deal. 

**Athena:** No, but it's an exciting one. Um, yeah, so, okay, well, we'll let you go get started on your LOI have the chat with the lawyers. We're here to support and review and help you through the next steps, so that's exciting.

Um, and then as soon as you get it under offer, then I want to make that introduction to the private lender too, because that is, that is an option on this, particularly in Oklahoma, which is, which is very, uh, excited about that. So, great work, Andrew, celebrate. Like, that was a big, big moment today. So even though it's like, you know, nothing [00:24:00] done, you got further and you did something that was pretty scary.

So 

**Andrew:** it's awesome. Yeah. I have a Canadian whiskey or something. 

**Athena:** We'll see you guys later. 

**Andrew:** Thank y'all. Alright, 

**Athena:** take care Andrew. 

**Andrew:** See you guys. 

**Athena:** Awesome. So exciting. Cool. Well, um, Justin, if you're cool with me calling on you, I know you had, uh, some, some progressions the last couple days. I unfortunately did not get the update from Ryan before he took off on vacation.

So how are you doing with your deals in hand? 

**Justin:** Uh, yeah. Very wildly different stages or different vibes for each of them, I guess I'll put it that way. Um, but, uh, trucking along, I think, yeah, I talked with Ryan and I think where we're at is, um, with the e-comm business. I, I guess I'm at an LOI point where I, I'm still trying to hammer out some of the, um, numbers in the model.

Ryan and I. I'll run into some things where we can't quite figure it out and, and I'm so therefore, like, [00:25:00] if I can't apply, I need the right outputs to inform whether, what offer I would be making, right? Uhhuh. So I'm running into a little bit of like, how do I figure that part out? Um, but if I can get that, then I'm at a point where the e-comm, where I would offer, uh, submit an LOI, um, candidly, that's probably not my favorite.

Option, or it's not my favorite business, but Ryan put it in a really good way. He goes, look, he goes Offer in a, in terms that you would make you like it. And he goes and, and then once they say is no, and best case, they're like, oh, okay. And you're surprised. You are like, great, you've got great terms or whatever.

So that's kind of the mentality. I'm approaching with that one, which is exactly how I kind of submit offers for real estate. And I'm like, great, if they take my great. What really works for me then fantastic. And it's not whatever kind of like Andrew was talking about, if it's not this one Okay. Like, moving on.

Um, so, but I, I'm, we're trying to work towards [00:26:00] that as best as I can this week. Um, the, the broker actually pinged me and saying like, Hey, are you still interested? And, uh, and I said, yes, of course. So, um, that's, that's where that stands. Um, and then yeah, then met in person with the retail, uh, furniture retail business on Friday.

Drove four hours round trip, same day. Don't recommend it, but I did it. Um, just I could get some FaceTime and get a read of the room. Very interesting meeting. Um. It was, uh, yeah, this was, I call it squishy. These are squishy owners or the owner, I say owners. There's one owner, but her boyfriend is heavily involved and has no ownership, but has a lot of opinions.

Um, and so he was doing actually more of the speaking than she was first time I had met him. And, uh, yeah, there, there's some interesting ones of this. This is like textbook, what do I not, what are you not telling me? There's more here than you're not telling me. Right? Um, so trying to uncover those rocks to ensure its [00:27:00] viability and, uh, that everything is on the up and up.

But if it is, I do think there is, uh, opportunity for growth, especially that the owner's just not a detailed operator. I don't think she really wants to be a business owner. I think she wants to be creative. That fell into business ownership. And was making pretty good money at it. So she's like, this is a cool lifestyle thing.

Um, and now she's looking to exit. So because of that, where there may be yellow flags, I do think actually that is growth levers that I can pull to, to make it happen. So I just gotta, I gotta try to reign them in and get some direct answers because, you know, there the vibe is really what's throwing me off a little bit there.

**Athena:** Um, that's really interesting. So. Do you think it's an element of her being scared about this process and feels like she needs someone, like advocating for her or protecting her or something [00:28:00] else going on with her dynamic? 

**Justin:** I don't think it's fear. I think it's. Honestly, lack of interest. Like, she just doesn't, like she's that owner.

She doesn't know her own numbers. Like 

Yeah. The 

**Justin:** broker, the broker was having to tell her, like, I was asking about like, what is this aback like, you know, trying to reconcile some of the p and l and she's like, I don't know. And then the broker stepped in and goes, oh yeah, remember I helped you with that.

That's when you, you know, had a big, you know, construction charge against a different business that you put on this, you know, expense, uh, or your expense to this business. And she, oh, okay. Okay. And so I. Detail oriented when it comes to that part of it. Um, she told me she's like taking cash under the table and it's in a safe in her house.

Um, for some, some business, uh, her daughter's an employee of the business, has never done a thing, and her daughter's rent and her car payment is funneled through the business as and expense. You know, she was just kind of telling all these things. I. I'm glad, I better know. I'd rather [00:29:00] know so I can kind of suss it out.

The, but what it, the read I'm getting is like, well, what, what are the pieces you aren't telling me? Like, because I, I get the feeling that there's maybe more rocks that haven't been uncovered yet. And when I asked, I was joking with Ryan, I was asking, you know, to the point where that's the same question, three different ways to try to get a pointed answer.

And it was always kind of like a little song of dance, you know? I'm like, okay. Like, well, you know, um. But again, I, I don't, I don't necessarily think that that's necessarily in, uh, intentional. I think it might just be like carelessness or lack of caring to, to attend to that kind of detail kind of thing.

You know what I mean? 

Yeah. 

**Justin:** Um, and again, I see that as, as dollar signs potentially, because that means for somebody who is detail oriented and can run a tight ship, which obviously I would intend on doing, um. Maybe there is an opportunity to kind of further legitimize a lot [00:30:00] of what she's started. 

**Athena:** Great Reid.

And, um, I love that you're tuning into like how you're feeling about it too. So was the broker at the in-person meeting? Mm-hmm. Or was it just the boyfriend and the owner? Yeah. Okay. Broker, boyfriend. Oh, no, no. Yeah, so. I mean her telling. So first of all, I will say that somebody putting their kids on payroll and doing that sort of thing tells me that they're good at tax strategy.

Like this is absolutely something you can and should unlock as like business owners yourself is, yeah, there's so many ways, and this is like. Legitimately can do it. Like you put your kid in a photo and guess what, they, they are on payroll as a model and it's totally okay to the point that, um, you know, I've been, since I moved back to the US I've been nerding out very hard on tax strategy.

'cause I didn't, you know, with the reciprocal stuff in other countries, I had to optimize for the country I was in. And now I'm back in the US like, oh God, I [00:31:00] gotta figure this out. And I don't have kids, so I'm like, God, there's like so many tax incentives you can get when you have kids and as a business owner, so I'll just call that out.

Like that wouldn't be a a, you know it, of course. It's like, oh my God, they're putting their kid on payroll. But it's, you know, a lot of people start businesses or have lifestyle businesses and one of, you know, it's not about how much money you make, it's about how much money you, you keep. Right? So that's, that's a.

Not, um, as long as, as they're doing it under the advice of, you know, the accountant or whatever, it's probably above board. But the fact she's disclosing it tells me there's, there's not a lot to hide, right? Like the fact she's telling you about the cash and the kids and that sort of thing. It's like you're like, oh my God, how are you running a business like this?

But. I don't know if any of you all have creative folks in your life, but my mother was an interior designer who also started her own business and as somebody that's like client servicing and process and operations, [00:32:00] I just watch how she does business. I'm like, oh god, you know, so I lived creatives and business practices don't often intermingle.

So she's the designer and like that sort of thing. Then it hopefully, it is just, just a lack of like, you know. It's not important, but I bet she's really good at the design and like the other aspects of it. I mean, 

**Justin:** she's very good at it. That's, she got a degree in it, has been practicing interior design for over 20 years.

I mean, she's, she does have a keen eye, 

**Athena:** so yeah. So if she's disclosing these things, but to me that's a good sign versus you having to like find it out. So, um, 

**Justin:** totally agree, fully agree. I mean, I, there's an element of. Ego about her and her boyfriend that where what she's created. And so I'm playing into that like, oh yeah, it's amazing.

You know, all of that. Stroking the ego thing. Um, yeah, she, she, she was the character. She told me a couple just fun [00:33:00] anecdotes. Like she told me she got paid for this like Mexico Cabo, Mexico deal builder, built a custom home and she outfitted it with her wares and uh, I think that was one of the big cash payments.

And I go. I go, wow, that's awesome. I go, what did you like, what did you do? Do you, what do you do with cash? Would you just get a duffel bag or a suitcase? And like in the movies, what do you do with it? And she's like, well, let's just say I have a safe at home. And I was like, okay. And uh, and I was like, do you get a lot of those, like cash infusions, like on the table?

And she goes, uh, well I do drive a Maserati. That, that was her answer. I was like, okay, I, I can read you like a book. 

**Athena:** So this is, this is great. I mean, uh, so one thing I will say is this process is, uh, it's really hard for business owners 'cause a lot of time the process reveals that they don't know their business as well as you, the buyer does half the time that you know, and, and when you've built something and you've built a career.[00:34:00] 

Then somebody questioning that and putting it under the lens. Like you can get defensive and, or react in, in different, I mean, imagine, you know, like somebody just put your whole career on the, like imagine the worst job interview ever. Right? Where they like, oh, what exactly were your sales numbers? Like in 2022 you said you had this percentage of close rate.

Like what exactly was that related? I, I noticed your close rate dropped in. You know, February of 2016. Can you tell me about that? Like, it's the same thing, like, imagine someone started drilling us on our career and our numbers, so that I was like, you're gonna get defensive. Like, but I'm good at my job.

You know? Yeah. Like, whatcha doing? So I, I, I, you know, I try to get into their mindset too, and like, what this must be like. So she's feeling comfortable enough to share this stuff with you, like that's great. I had a, um, you'll appreciate this 'cause you're in Austin. Do you, do you remember, um, or have you been past Jurassic car wash on South [00:35:00] Congress with all the animatronic dinosaurs?

**Justin:** Yeah. Yeah. Long time time, yes. 

**Athena:** I was trying to buy that business actually, like I got it, got in touch with the owner off market, and he was just the most hilarious person I have ever met. And he would tell me, like, I just would spend hours with him and he'd tell me stories, you know, and the stories would reveal a lot about what it was like to.

On a car wash. One of them in particular was like in January when it was freezing and he is like, yeah, I got an alert that there was humans in the car wash. So of course I drove down there to check it out and he is like, and then they had a little dog wash on site too, so there's a car wash and then a dog wash.

And he found two young girls like washing.

The dog wash and he is like, this is not the social media you're thinking of. It's fun. So, um, anyways, uh, it sounds like you've got a really good relationship. Your read is like, I'm not sure what else is behind the scenes. So what are you seeing as the next [00:36:00] steps and what's your appetite on, on this one?

Yeah. Despite these. Interesting interactions so far. 

**Justin:** Yeah. My next step here is I'm compiling a, a list of questions that I went in with a bunch of questions. Like I said, I kind of would ask a couple different ways and didn't really get the answers I needed. Uh, a lot of rapport building that was constructive though, to the point where, you know, the broker called me, uh, yesterday and said, uh, just unsolicited and says, Hey, we really like you.

Like, and they had this under LOII think before, and were very. Publicly stating how they did not like that buyer and it just wasn't the right fit and that kind of thing. And so, um, brokers like, yeah, she's definitely sees vision together. She wants to like, have some kind of, she, a lot of what we talked about was what a, uh, a partnership would be.

Not like an equity partnership where she maintains anything official in the business, but where the, the endeavor she's moving on to are very tangential and, and correlated. And so she [00:37:00] wants to feed this like. Business 'cause it was her baby and there's natural like market fit for the same clientele, that kind of thing.

And so I was like, well maybe there's like a comp structure we can like, you know, figure out 'cause like that'd be great. You know, that kind of thing. Um. Uh, so that's what the, the broker called me also to talk about. He's like, Hey, by the way, I mean, it was a good and a bad thing. Good thing was like, Hey, we like you.

We definitely see a path forward and we want to incorporate this growth, which she had not had on the table with the other buyer in the original, original iteration. Um, she intentionally wanted to keep that separate. She goes, but with you, she sees like she likes and wants to kind of work together and sees what that path.

That could be fun and interesting. Um, he goes, but because there's new dollars now coming in, he goes, we wanna retrade and we want to increase the price. So he called me to tell me, he is like, Hey. Yeah, now it's, I think it was listed at a million years. Now it's 1.125. Um, and I mean, I've got a whole talk track.

I'm gonna respond to that. But, [00:38:00] um, nonetheless, the interesting part was that. It got their brains gen like thinking and, and growth terms. That evidently was not the situation prior to kind of when I came into line of sight. So, um, so it's good. Yeah. But my step is questions. I gotta put together these more detailed questions and I'm gonna get, uh, I'm gonna get another call with the seller, uh, and the broker, I mean, if, if he wants to join and then, um, kind of.

Kind of what you were talking about, Andrew, it's like, Hey, look, I got, I got a lot that's gonna be on the line here. Like, I need brass, like kind of the brass tacks, but not, I mean, I'll position it way more politically than that, you know, and, and yeah, massage it. But that's the idea is like, Hey, I need to know these things, but it's all under the guise of like, so I can get you an offer.

You know, like that's why I'm looking for this. Um, so that's my next step. And then I think if I can get what I need from there, uh, maybe an LOI, uh, after that. 

**Athena:** Great. Okay, cool. So [00:39:00] the broker sounds like they really like you too. Did you get a sense that it was a man, he, yeah. Mm-hmm. The broker? Yeah. Did you get a sense that he was frustrated with the boyfriend or, 

**Justin:** I don't know.

I, this is gonna sound bad. My read on the broker is that he. This thing has been listed for, I think the better part of 18 months and 12 to 18 months. Somewhere in that time. Again, even that squishy, but over a year, maybe around a to a year and a half. And I think he is just like a puppy dog wanting to close this thing so badly.

And so he is like, yes, man to, to me, to them to like. He's just like, whatever, like whatever we can do to get this thing done. I, I think he's just kind of at with end, uh, at this point. Yeah. Not, I can't necessarily see who's directed at, maybe it's just the process in general. [00:40:00] Um, so I don't know if he has a, I didn't get a read on him and how he feels about, you know, the boyfriend or any of that.

I think more of just he's acquiescing to whoever's like coming to the table can make this thing happen. He's like, okay, let's do it. 

**Athena:** Why did the, so they were under offer before? 

**Justin:** Mm-hmm. 

**Athena:** Why didn't that go through? 

**Justin:** I was told a number of reasons. Uh, one, he didn't pass the vibe check, for lack of a better phrase, because she is again, this kind of creative, you know, very like.

Self-assured, I guess, you know, the way to put it. Um, and it kind of has this, uh, friendly, I wanna work with people I like, kind of personality. He was, I again, their words, not mine. He was an engineer who was I colder and more technically minded, less, uh, compatible from just a personality and [00:41:00] kind of, you know.

My salesy, which is my background, I guess, perspective. Um, so there was a personality conflict. One, two was he was asking too many, uh, requirements in his offer of her. I, I don't know the details, but my read is that there was like a heavy seller note component plus an extended period where she was gonna be directly involved with the business.

Plus, um, he didn't have the funding like it came out that like he couldn't get the funding together, really make it happen. So there's a lot of wasted time that they were upset about, um, and an opportunity cost for her of taking it off the market for, you know, three or four months, whatever it was. Um, so it, all, all of these things they were telling and, and this so stupid.

The broker said that he had a weird verbal tick, like the way he would respond to questions with Yes, but he wouldn't say, yeah, he would, he, I can't even, I'm not even gonna do it 'cause it's just silly. He actually [00:42:00] mimicked it for me, but he responded like verbally in a way that was annoying to them. Um, again, I can't make this up and so.

Carry on. Any, anything else? All of those. No. No. That's it. Just all of those things. They're just not a who, who, compatibility, 

**Athena:** who canceled the LOI, the seller or the buyer? 

**Justin:** Seller. They said that they walked away. Seller 

**Athena:** canceled. Okay. 

**Justin:** Yeah. 

**Athena:** So, um, I'm gonna use you as a, a learning example for the group. When a business was under LOI.

And it's no longer, you want to dig into the why, right? There's, there's a story there and often they're gonna spin in it, like blaming the buyer. Um, but if he couldn't get the funding together, I'm like, is it because it's not fundable? Right. So it's like there's their, their version of the stories and then like, you don't get the [00:43:00] potential buyers, so it's like, oh, we'll just give you all these reasons or whatever.

So it sounds like you're really good at disarming them. Also, the brokers that it's with then. So I would almost like, at this point, I would schedule a call just with the broker and be like, Hey, can you tell me a little bit more about, you know. Like, what do you mean he couldn't get the funding together?

Has SBA looked at this? Like, you know, are you guys confident on that? Like, just wanna know what I like, how do I, and you can almost use him to like, I know she's particular, so I just wanna make sure I'm positioning myself well. Like, can you, you know, like what happened here and what did they not like about this?

And you know, and really your mission is like, what the hell happened there? Right? Mm. And is she gonna be so difficult that it's it's not, or is there, like, it's not that he couldn't get the financing, it's that it's not financeable, you know? Yeah. That's my big question. When they, when they blame the buyer of not being able to get financing [00:44:00] together, um.

Sometimes they'll, they'll wrap it up, is like, it's a buyer's fault. But like, so I, and I, I apologize. I know Luke will know the specifics a little bit more on whether this was like SBA pre-qual or not, you know. But, um, so that's, that's a fun one to kind of like, I, and you're, you're good at this, so I think you could have a call with the broker Yeah.

And cover a lot more there. I 

**Justin:** did ask some of those questions. Yeah. It's not, I don't believe that Prequal, I.

Had had seen a pre-approval or any pre-qual or anything from their buyer, they said, no. And I go, well, that's on you guys. You need to vet the buyer better that you know, or whatever. So, I mean, so I mean, I, I, I have been pushing a little bit just, you know, in a very cheeky way, but, um. I'm like, guys, if, if it's truly, if it really was him as a bad buyer, then it was honestly the broker is like your fault that you didn't train that better and, and put somebody better qualified in front of your, your [00:45:00] sellers.

Um, I don't think any of that was in place. Mm-hmm. 

**Athena:** Yeah. Um, 

**Justin:** to the tune where they wanna charge, they want me or insert new buyer to put, uh, put down, uh, earnest money. Which I'm not going to do, but Yeah. 

**Athena:** Yeah. Especially if it's sold the market. Like if it's competitive, then if it's like genuinely in a third party account that you can get your money back.

Like, you know, there's very few circumstances where it's like you might have to do that just to weed out the competition. And under the circumstances were like. You genuinely can get it back and you have a lawyer review it and blah, blah, blah. Um, but, 'cause you know what a nerd I am. I've been watching all these like legislation state by state on brokering laws and stuff like that.

And there, there's, there's a lot. They're complicated. They're weird. Um, which is why we don't, we're not brokers. Um, but if a [00:46:00] broker. Has you put money into like account they control if the broker has control of it, that is like a against regulation across the board and B can nullify them getting their broker fees in the deal.

So if they're doing that, it's a big no-no. So the broker, in order for the broker to be able to like claim their fees, like if somebody's like, I don't wanna pay you. If they did something like put earnest money in an account that they control, like that could nullify it so. 

You know, it's 

**Athena:** almost to their, their, you know, detriment if they don't even realize that that's a thing's 

**Justin:** Exactly.

And to be fair, this wasn't the broker's idea, this is the boyfriend's idea. Oh God. 'cause he was the one who was like, my girl was wasted four months of her time and cost her $40,000 in like, she couldn't turn over inventory or, so I don't know. He was trying to explain it all. Um, he thinks some stuff a hot shot.

So he was trying to tell me why I needed to come with earnest money [00:47:00] and my rebuttal was, did you. Your buyer, like, did you look into him? Have you and, and I looked at the broker, I go, I go, do you guys know Live Oak? And he goes, of course we know Live Oak. I goes, did you share with them my pre-approval letter?

I was like, I'm prequalified for far more than what this business is asking for. Yeah. And so I was like, you're fine. 

**Athena:** Sure. Right. Good. I love that. I love that confidence. Justin. This is awesome. Okay. How can we help at this point? Are you pretty clear on next steps? I. 

**Justin:** Pretty clear next steps. Yeah. Honestly, the model stuff, if I can get, like, whatever we can do, I'm happy to, happy to have a working session or kind of walk through what I've been doing and where Ryan and I have been kind of run into some walls on the model because I can't, it's hard for me to know really what the details of the offer would be until I can see what the, how the model plays out in, in you like working practice.

**Athena:** You must have read my mind. It was a perfect tee up for the preview of what the next buyer's club call is gonna be about. Okay. So, um, on [00:48:00] Thursday we've made some, uh, updates that we'll be showing y'all on Thursday to just make it a little bit more user friendly. So y'all have been using it, it's really great.

It's giving us feedback and we're gonna keep editing it. So, but I wanna do a deep dive session on modeling on Thursday. 'cause I know that's a thing that everybody ask. Like we get more help with modeling, so on our individual call. We can go through that. Absolutely. And um, like anybody that's working a model right now, if you want to like send it to us in advance, we can pull it up on that call.

If everybody's feeling shy about that, that's fine. I'm gonna be bringing up the, the new template on that call and like working through it and just showing how to use it. So come to that call with your questions on like, how do I do this and how would I do that and et cetera. So that, um, you know, I can show you guys in the template in real time.

Um, and. Yeah. So two opportunities for you there to get more modeling time and I think, you know, so to[00:49:00] 

talk through that on, on the, the one that you're not that interested in, this is a great opportunity to like. Just practice the modeling, right? It's like, well, what number would I be like, this is a no-brainer for me to say yes to this deal, you know? And like, or is there no number? And that tells you something too.

But like, if they were to agree to this, they would be like, yeah, I have to do this. You know? So you can use the modeling in that way to just like, uh, you know, even though it's not a deal that you necessarily want to like, that you're super excited about, it's a deal that's in your head that you know.

Deeper than like other, like if I were to give you a sim on another business that you couldn't buy, you wouldn't, you wouldn't lock into it the same way that you have this one. 'cause you've had all these conversations, you've got your internal feelings. So I'd, um, challenge you to like, do the modeling on, on that business also.

Like, see, see there, and [00:50:00] we can practice that either in the group call or with our call. I can't remember what comes first, but 

**Justin:** like, 

**Athena:** feel free to steal that time with the modeling when we do it. Yeah, 

**Justin:** yeah. I think you and I are set for Friday. Yeah. And to your point, I've, I've done that. So I've, it's all the model's already in there.

I mean, it needs tweaking to be sure it's right. Great. Um, but uh, yeah, 'cause I'm, I'm doing that for sure. 

**Athena:** Okay, cool. And then just, just so I'm clear on the feedback, is it like you haven't worked out how to, how to structure it or some of the, essentially something wrong with the, the sheet itself? 

**Justin:** A a little bit of, a little bit of structuring input.

Um, some of the parts of the sheet, especially like the seller's note section, uh, the performance components. Yeah, I didn't quite get, Ryan and I were looking at some of the 10 year forecast, and we didn't understand why the outputs were reading the way they would based on the inputs. So, so, so 

**Athena:** that is exactly the updates that we're making to make it clearer for you all.

'cause it's, it's okay. Computing properly, [00:51:00] it's just not in a, and I even got confused on it, so that's my bad. But like, on, on how we use the tool, because they're, they're super tools that he put in there, but I, I needed to understand it better on how we put it in there. So, yeah. Yeah. We're gonna be clarifying.

How do you use that performance note tool in the spreadsheet? So in theory, I can talk you all through it in terms of how we built it in the spreadsheet. It's gonna be a little bit clearer there, and that's where I wanna spend the bulk of the time on, is using the different scenarios and then being able to use the different notes and seeing how that changes materially, like the purchase price that you can make.

So that was the plan for Thursday. Um, and we'll have the, um, we're having our, um, spreadsheet builder update all that in the meantime. But if you want, um, record a little screen share of where you were running into your problems, where you were getting confused, which will be helpful. 'cause we're actually making those updates now.

So if there's anything else that I didn't [00:52:00] catch or we get feedback from other people, we can, we can feed that into Cool. Um, in Loom you can do, or not in Loom, sorry. In Slack, when you hit the video button, it actually gives you a screen share option. Um, so you can hit the video button in our, in your Slack channel and select your screen and just do a quick, it's like, if it's under five minutes, you can just use Slack to do it.

Just. Super easy to do and you can turn off your camera so you don't have to do that. Um, but just, it's a, it's a tool that I think is so cool in Slack that I don't see a lot of people use, but that's really helpful. Like, especially if y'all are in modeling and you're having problems, by all means don't wait for the call with Ryan, like do a little screen share real quick of what you're doing and then share the link to the model in the chat and we can go in there and dig it.

Um. And, and, and try to respond to you quicker than, you know, waiting for a call with us and that sort of thing. So feel free to everybody use that 'cause. Um, the modeling in particular is something I love learning [00:53:00] out about. Um, I know the whole team is kind of learning about it too, so I. Um, yeah. Cool. Um, so yeah, feel free to screen share and, and share the link to the one that you're working off of and if there's anything I didn't catch in terms of clarity, it's really helpful to get that feedback from y'all.

So where you are getting confused or not saying that that's what's happening in there, but like any questions that you're having in the sheet, other people are probably having 'em too. So please, please, please share that feedback. It's really useful for us 'cause we wanna make that thing like as plug and play.

As possible, which is hard to do on very complicated, multimillion dollar, multilayered, you know, like debt waterfalls and that sort of thing. But we're trying, so all the feedback is really helpful. But this, this is exciting. It sounds like, uh, you know, this, this one feels like it has some teeth to it, so Yeah, for sure.

Awesome. Great. Cool. Well, looking forward to seeing that. Um, and then, like I said, uh, for everyone [00:54:00] next Thursday we're gonna be, um, just giving you the updated template on the, the, um. Financial modeling template based on the feedback we've been getting from y'all. We're just trying to clear things up and make it a little bit more clearer.

So that's gonna be the session is me actually just like pulling up the template and whether y'all have live deals for me to work through or not, I'm gonna be showing you specifically how to use those different notes and then how to use the different scenarios, uh, to be able to decide like, well, okay, if I were to do a purchase price and it.

I'm able to add a performance based note. How would I do that? So that's gonna be on the next Buyer's Club call. Um, as you know, Ryan is on vacation. How dare he go on vacation? I know you all are sad, uh, about having to do with me this week. So. Um, I've got the team with a bat signal to me. If y'all need anything, like, don't hesitate.

We're still here for you. I'm looking after, you know, the, the Ryan type [00:55:00] questions while he's away this week. So, um, we're here for you. Use your channels, deals, working, or the team's working on some great deals for you. We actually have our calls right after this call to. Talk about all the deals, so I get to hear about all the deals that y'all are looking at too.

Um, but exciting stuff. So, um, keep us posted, use the channels. We're all still here for you with Brian being away. And next Thursday we will see you for some financial modeling stuff. Thanks everyone. Have a great day. Thanks. Bye bye.
