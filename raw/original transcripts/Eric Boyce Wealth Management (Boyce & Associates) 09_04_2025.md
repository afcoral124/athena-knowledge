# AcquiMatch Buyers Club 09/04/2025

[00:00:00] 

**Athena:** Hello? Hello? Hey Gil. Welcome. Hey Josh, how's it going? Welcome to your first Buyers Club, Josh, Polly and Justin. Great to see you. Um, I think Lisa might be here too. So excited to see you. Hey Lisa. Welcome. Um, so I'm super excited for today 'cause this is a topic that I will, uh, ashamedly Admit is kind of a blind spot for me.

Um, so it was really excited when I, I've known Eric for a while. Actually. We met when I started going to the Texas Association of Business Brokers Local Meetup. Uh, we actually met before that at A-A-A-S-B-A lender out here host. Meetups as well. So known him for a while. He is seen us since, uh, the, you know, my early searcher days.

Um, and a real amazing wealth of knowledge. [00:01:00] Um, and his business does, uh, both wealth management and business valuations. And the business valuations actually came out of and was born out of wanting to help business owners with their wealth management and make the most of their biggest asset that they were investing their time and resources into as business owners.

Um. So when we were talking about topics to, uh, work with on you all, obviously business valuation and how that that comes together is an obvious one. But the other non-obvious one is, well, what are you doing with the money that you're making as a business owner? Where are you putting that? When we're W twos, you know, a lot of, at least, you know, the, the retirement accounts are kind of decided for us, et cetera.

But when you're a business owner, you have a lot more options available to you. And you know, when we were talking about the brief for this, I was like, what do you wish? Business owners did when they became business owners. What do you wish they did when they started making money? So this is Eric's opportunity to [00:02:00] kind of intercept you before you come, business owners, to think about all the things, um, around wealth management.

So super excited for, uh, Eric and his team to be here. Uh, Tom's also here. So for those of you that weren't here live a couple weeks ago, they did a really amazing session on business valuations and the five pillars of what makes value in a business. So I highly recommend going back and watching the replay, but Eric, uh, thank you so much for being here and talking, talking about the topic that you know so well.

So please, uh, give us an overview of yourself and your team. 

**Eric:** Terrific. Thank you, Athena. Well, it's good to be back with you. I'm having a deja vu all over again, and, uh, I know it was just a, just a few weeks ago. And, and as you mentioned earlier there, we've got some new folks on the call. So, uh, we had a really, um, a fun time, uh, with all of you a few weeks ago kind of talking about.

Anchors and, uh, you know, and, and attributes to value and kind of the five pillars as Athena mentioned. And, [00:03:00] um, you know, uh, really it kind of, our practice is built around several different, uh, different legs. And one of those is working with business owners. And I think this is a real jewel of an opportunity because all of you are w twos that are beginning to kind of, uh, transition into that entrepreneurial category.

And so, uh, again, this is a wonderful opportunity for us to kind of articulate what are the things that maybe you should be thinking about. Like last time we talked about. You know, what are the things that help to drive value? And what are the things that, you know, help to typically provide anchors to value?

And today we're gonna like, focus on you. And then I'm gonna let, I'm gonna introduce my colleagues here. Uh, but uh, a little bit about our firm, voice and Associates. Wealth Consulting is about an eight and a half year company. I've been managing money for over 30 years. Uh, started off actually in treasury management.

Uh, and, uh, we've got, uh, 10 people in our firm, and two of those are with me right now. Uh, many of you met Tom Kimmler, um, and he's our chief business appraiser. Uh, he's [00:04:00] a certified valuation analyst and a chartered financial analyst as well. So he does all of our business valuations. And, uh, today you'll get to hear.

Uh, Kelly Griggs, uh, she's also on the call. Uh, Kelly's been with me, uh, for, for quite a long time. I've known Tom for over 20 years and worked with Tom previously. And Kelly I've known for a long time, and she's been on our team for a number of years, and she's, uh, one of our senior, uh, financial planners.

And she's gonna go into a lot of like, conversation and dialogue about, you know, kind of as you're sitting there, like preparing to jump into that entrepreneurial ranks, you know, kind of looking your, yourself in the mirror. What are the things that, you know, people tend to forget to do right? When you're running a business?

And, and again, you'll, you'll hear me kind of interject a little bit here and there because I'm a business owner myself, and so I can actually speak from a lot of experience. Uh, but we're really grateful for the opportunity to visit with you. Um, I will provide these slides to Athena, uh, and so she can distribute those.

And I know this is being [00:05:00] archived as well, but hopefully we'll leave plenty of time for questions. Uh, but, um, I'll, uh, start the presentation and then I'm gonna hand off to Kelly, and then Kelly's going to, uh, you know, visit with you for a bit. And then she's gonna hand back off to me. And then, uh, we'll be, be ready for questions.

So as I am talking, I am. Sharing my 

**Athena:** amazing. I'm just gonna type in verbally real quick too, folks, like as, as you're watching this, like, please, you know, this is a great opportunity to be a little selfish and ask questions about your personal situation at the end too. So, you know, you can ask questions at the end about the content, but also, you know, we are going to have them in for an hour and a half.

So let's make the most of it. I will hog the, the mic with questions until y'all put your hands up with questions and we'll let you know when that's, that that, uh, question period starts at the end of this presentation. So Eric and team, thank you so much Over to you. 

**Eric:** You, you bet, you bet. Well, uh, again, as some of you that were with us last time, kind of.[00:06:00] 

Um, you know, remember the comments at the front end. It's like, why? Why, what's our why? Why are we doing what we're doing? And obviously for business owners, I mean, you know, oftentimes you, you don't have the opportunity like a, a like death, divorce, something comes in the way and you have to take action in the moment.

And we're all about preparation. And so we've kind of ripped up the script on, you know, wealth management because that wealth occurs for many of you. This is gonna be your biggest investment and it's gonna be the biggest driver of your net worth. And so, you know, I think we're wired to kind of help you drive value while you're in the business.

And again, you know, most of you, if not all of you are. Like not even there yet, but you're going to be. And so what are the things to think about while you're running your business to help prepare for that eventual exit? Because I think the laws of nature's tell tell us that, uh, you know, we're all gonna be exiting at some point whether we like it or not.

And, you know, uh, ostensibly we all want to be able to go out on our own terms. So that just kind of like [00:07:00] lays the foundation of why we do what we do because, uh, you know, we've seen far too many times, you know, owners come after the sale to us and then they find out, okay, I can't sustain the lifestyle or the retirement that I had hoped for.

This is all trying to, you know, get out in front of that and be preventative. So we'll just jump into it first. Um, I have to make the, the lawyers happy. So there are disclaimers. So I, what I'd like to do is actually go back to that presentation. I realize some of you didn't see that, but, uh, the recap here is just basically, you know, a summary of these opportunity costs.

And so today we're really gonna focus on the business owner. And so there's value that is, you know, derived and driven in the business that affects the owner. But then there's also things that you as an owner can do and so many of you, like in your W2 lives or you know, have done planning, have done estate planning and things like that.

And if you have congratulations, uh, but if you haven't, just realize like the starting point that this is a [00:08:00] slide from last, last time. It's like, you know, half of business owners don't have a will. And you think about, well, what happens to you if you're the primary driver of the business? And what happens to the business, you know, if you don't have coverage, what happens to your family?

Right? And, you know, you have to, you know, somebody's gonna take your ownership interest in your business, and how is that gonna be disposed of? And, and so, um, you know, uh, quite a few people haven't started planning. And then, you know, the life insurance thing is, uh, you know, whether it's Keyman, uh, or it's, you know, some type of, uh, you know, transition plan.

Uh, you know, for, for you. I mean, there's, you know, there are a lot of ways to, to look at this. Uh, but, uh, we're just kind of starting here just like these are statistics that are, uh, that are well known in the industry. And so, uh, we want to take a moment or take, take a few minutes actually and kind of talk about you.

So the last check, the, uh, last, uh, slide rather that we had in, in the, uh, presentation last week was, [00:09:00] uh, was this one. And, you know, I thought eight, number eight was just about as important as any of the other ones. And that's focused on you because oftentimes you get so caught up in the day-to-day grind of running a business.

And again, I'm, uh, you know, I'm, I provide my own testimonial on this that sometimes it's hard to kind of take a step back and focus on me and how am I impacting my family? What kind of risk am I subjecting them to? So, um, so this is kind of the backdrop of what, why we wanted to launch into, uh, this particular sleeve today.

So these are the five pillars of value that Athena alluded to, uh, previously. And so, you know, the one that I wanna focus on is in that lower right, and that's that owner readiness, owner psychology component. Because it is, uh, impactful to value, it's very hard to, to quantify. I, uh, but it does impact. And just think about yourself as an owner or owner to be rather.

And, um, you know, and how your [00:10:00] anxieties and your emotions and your enthusiasm, how they can impact the value and the esprit de corps of your, of your team, you know, either on a, in a good way or perhaps in an adverse way. But, uh, so this is kind of where we're gonna focus on today. So business owner financial planning, and again, I'm gonna talk for a little bit and I'm gonna hand off to Kelly and she's got some, uh, very important things that I know that she wants to share with you.

But, um, you know, separating, you know, basically separating yourself from the business, uh, and, and financials and uh, and, and, and basically in, in, in just about everything, it's easy. And I can, again, I can speak from experience where you start a business, or in your case, maybe acquire a business. And there's, uh, you know, there's this thought, well, okay, if we get in a tight spot, I'll fund the business, or, you know, I'll take care of this personally to get us off the ground because, you know, we, you know, maybe there's some, uh, uh, administrative [00:11:00] things that kind of make it less efficient if you're trying to do it with the business.

But the problem is, uh, as you get farther down the road, those entanglements, uh, can be problematic. And first and foremost, it could be. Problematic from the standpoint of being, having your, you know, your tax and your legal status invalidated. Uh, and you certainly don't want that 'cause there are protections that structures like LLCs afford you.

But if that's, you know, if there's a lot of personal and entanglements financially, uh, or you know, from a administrative side, it, it, you run the risk of potentially invalidating, uh, those, those structures. And, and, uh, you know, just aside, just as an aside. And I know Tom would agree on this, and oftentimes we do find a lot of instances where we're having to do forensic analysis on financials to separate personal expenses from those that are really germane to the, to the business.

So, uh, and there's a lot of information on these slides. I'm not gonna like necessarily read these, but just [00:12:00] on this particular slide, really the key takeaway is just think about, you know, how you, uh, go, go about, like, you know, when you transition in the business and setting up your chart of accounts or, you know, evaluating how that chart of accounts is gonna look, and just making sure that you try to do as much as you can to de tether your personal financial situation from that of the business.

Okay. Um, and then the other thing which I think Kelly might allude to, uh, coming up is the, the emergency funds. And, you know, this is where I, I see from time to time where, you know, the, the people kind of view contingencies and saying, well, if the business gets. In a sticky spot. Well, I can, uh, I can commit, you know, I, I can throw some money into it.

Well, uh, you know, I, I think, you know, you should be thinking, as we talked about before, there's a lot of folks that don't do contingency planning, that don't do, uh, that don't do [00:13:00] the emergency reserve allocations, you know, for, uh, you know, for unknown contingencies. And I think last time we used the, the pandemic, which obviously is very hard to plan for.

But, um, but there are other things, you know, like changes in economic cycles and competitive situations that, you know, that really make it important for you, you as a business owner to create a business reserve. But don't forget about yourself too, right? Because there are gonna be times, and as we'll talk about this later, you know, you're gonna depend on that business for a large part of your household cash flow, right?

And if there's a disruption in the business, uh, and again, you know, there have been moments in, in my business life where. Uh, we've had major downturns in the market and, you know, my employees continue to get paid as they're getting paid, and I'm the one who's taking a pay cut to make sure that the, the ship keeps sailing forward.

And so, you know, I, if you're the business owner and sometimes you make those sacrifices or maybe you're [00:14:00] inclined to make those sacrifices, just make sure that you're thinking about your personal, uh, emergency funds, your family emergency funds, uh, 'cause that's also extremely, uh, important. Uh, because business as we know, is not perfectly, you know, linear.

Uh, there are bumps along the road. The other thing too, um, is the reliance that we tend to see a lot of, and this is again, my, one of my whys on why we do business valuations. Because, you know, we saw, uh, you know, I've seen a lot of, you know, former business owners come to us. You know, come to me and want, want me to manage their, you know, the proceeds of their investment.

And then you have, you wind up having a lot of critical conversations to say, well, you can't sustain the lifestyle that you were either used to or desire in retirement because, you know, you didn't, you know, generate enough, uh, you know, from the sale of your business, uh, to, to accomplish [00:15:00] that. You know? And so, uh, there, there's, that has a tremendous amount of shock value.

And so that's why it's really important to, you know, get out ahead of it. And again, this is why it's a real blessing to talk to you as, as you're preparing to jump into your entrepreneurial shoes, that you can think about this, uh, all the while, but. The business is gonna be a large part of your net worth, but you know, you do have time to diversify your sources of income over time.

That, that there you're gonna create, hopefully, financial security to some extent that lives outside of the fortunes of the business. And, and we're gonna talk about some of those later. Like, you know, your retirement plans and what are the things you know that, that, that you should be doing as a matter of course.

And what are the things, the, the options that you may have, you know, that may avail yourself to as an owner that would allow you to put even more money away that then kind of de-risks your situation because you've got financial resources that are outside the [00:16:00] business that are not, uh, necessarily, uh, you know, at, at, at risk, uh, from a, um, you know, from a change in valuation, whatnot is, you know, again, the slide has a lot of, a lot of verbiage on it, but basically.

Know that, you know, we, we live in a world of economic cycles and again, you know, business is not linear. We have bumps, peaks and valleys in the road. And the last thing you want to do is put yourself in a situation where you're getting a value of a business that you know you're forced to sell. And, uh, you happen to be in an economic downturn.

And so that value that you receive is obviously less than what you, what you were, were expecting, or you know, less, less than what you need. So, um, and then this is something that we did touch on last time. It's the consequences of not having that succession, uh, plan, uh, or not having that transition plan.

Uh, it [00:17:00] is, it does tie back into your personal financial situation because. You know, these are the types of things that, you know, can impact value. And, you know, when we do our risk assessments and we do our buildups, you know, the greater the, the number of discounts that are applied, uh, or the great, greater the amount of, uh, you know, risk that's perceived, you know, basically your, your discount rate is higher, and so your value is lower.

And one of those, uh, is, uh, certainly not having any kind of a succession or transition plan. And, and again, a lot of business owners don't have that, and a lot of business owners don't plan and they don't forward project. Uh, so, uh, again, as last time was as much kind of a call to action to try to be forward thinking about this, uh, it's important to know that that does tie back to your personal fortunes in terms of when you're ready to sell that business, uh, that it, it could have a meaningful impact, uh, as you prepare to, to [00:18:00] sell and transition, uh, your business.

So, um, some rhetorical questions to ask. Right? And you know, and again, the statistics say, um, from the exit planning institute that, you know, three quarters of business owners roughly sell to a third party and three quar, uh, 70% or so of business owners that do sell say that maybe it didn't accomplish what their goals were in retrospect.

And so, you know, that's kind of our call to action as a service provider to try to help people better prepare. So those. Statistics, you know, look better for them. But you know how, you know, when you think about the long term, you know, and again, you're just getting involved in your business now, or you're on the eve of this, but be thinking along the way.

Like, okay, well how much, what, what is my future vision for retirement? And what does retirement look like? How is that defined? And am I gonna have the [00:19:00] resources to do that? And, you know, how much will I need from that business? You know? And, um, and then also vision goals. And what we do is very goals based, uh, on our financial planning.

And, you know, we want you, when you're not owning your business anymore, uh, to be able to afford everything that, uh, you know, afford to do everything that's, that's in front of you. And enjoy, enjoy that time. And obviously we want you to enjoy, you know, your time while you're still in the business. But, um, uh, you know that there are a lot of things that I think you.

You can do now. Uh, it requires a little bit of work and it requires a little bit of quiet time thinking. Uh, but I'm, I can, uh, you know, I don't do guarantees as a rule, but I can guarantee you it will provide a, a better outcome to you. And again, just to say that most people, uh, don't do this type of visioning.

But, uh, but these are kind of the rhetorical questions that, you know, that I would begin to ask [00:20:00] once you get in that pilot seat, uh, of being a business owner. Uh, and, um, with that, um, I will hand it over to Kelly, uh, with the topic that you see here is just like, you know, what, what do people typically not think of, uh, you know, as a business owner when you get into your business?

So, uh, with that, I'll, uh, hand off to Kelly. 

**Kelly:** All right, well, good afternoon everyone. Um, so you know right here, uh, you know, when you're the boss, the freedom is yours. Yay. So is the final responsibility of it, right? So, um, so that's just leading on that. Uh, you can go ahead and press the slide, Eric. I'll do a little finger move that'll tell you.

**Athena:** Okay, 

**Kelly:** Courtney, we're in the same office, by the way. He's just in another space, another room, so I could just holler it. Um, so what you'll see here is, um, well an overview As business owners, you know, [00:21:00] you're probably expecting yourself to, to, to throw everything into your business. You're anticipating putting your time and your money and your energy.

And you might even know it might become your identity. Um, and that passion is, is wonderful, and that's what will help the business succeed. But there's something that, that we see all too often that we want to remind, um, you guys are or particular right now on, on, on the eve of going into owning your own business to plan for it.

To plan that you still need to keep up with your own personal financial, you need to have that personal security apart from the business. And, and so I'm a big visual person here. So this, this little chart, well, not intricate or anything, but just as a reminder to separate your business and your personal wealth.

So, um, we hear all too often. Particularly with new business owners. [00:22:00] Well, you know, I'm, as we start and we're finally making money, and as we start making money, I've gotta put it back into the business. I'm gonna put it back into the business and I'm gonna say, whoa, hold up. You can't put it all back in the business.

You do need to pay yourself, and that's to protect yourself and your family and your dreams later on. So, just as a best practice, whatever that percentage is, you know, it's gonna vary for every single business, for every situation, but taking a percentage of the profits of the business. Out of the business and putting it into your personal financial, um, wealth.

So some of that might be those qualified accounts that, um, Eric touched on, um, a minute ago, which we know we, we, we need to, you know, as you were working, you were probably contributing to a 401k and you know, you can have a separate, um, IRA and we know Roth accounts. [00:23:00] Well, those still exist. And so finding those as you are, are beginning those as you start your business, making sure that a portion of the profits as a business owner are still, um, being built for your future.

And, and I did wanna point on that it's not all qualified accounts. Um, and, and this is often overlooked, but there is, um, a segue. Now, the exact percentage is gonna vary for every individual, but. You know, a percentage to qualified and then another percentage to non-qualified accounts because they have different tax advantages, um, different rules and regulations obviously.

And they, and both accounts provide different, um, protections for your own personal security later on. And, and so you can, you can see up here, but, but again, we've all, we've all heard, you know, income diversification, this is, this is at its source, you know, as you [00:24:00] make those profits and how you're gonna funnel it out for your own personal wealth.

Um, we know retirement security is extremely important. Um, but what intends to happen is if we don't have a plan for it, then it doesn't happen all of a sudden. Two years go by and it's like, oh, I, I needed to start. What account do I need to start? Start it when you start your business, and even if you fund, like, maybe it's a, a solo 401k or a SEP account, um, there's, there's many variations.

Even if you fund it minimally, at least you are getting that habit started. Um, and having that income diversification. All right, push the slide, Eric.

And then, um, the fun, fun topic is risk management. [00:25:00] And I'm a big proponent on that because having options, um, is a good thing. And having the protection, you know, you can't buy protection when you need it. You have to have it in place. Before you need it. Um, so as you were a W2 employee, you, you most likely had different benefits.

Maybe it was life insurance provided to you, um, possibly disability insurance, um, all of those things. Well, those still need to continue. Um, and, and there's, you know, there's a tossup. I'm not gonna tell you, you, you need to have what type of life insurance you need to have. It's going to vary on your unique circumstances, but to have some protection to protect your family, to protect yourself, um, is extremely important.

And then, and then something that I, I do wanna touch on with disability [00:26:00] insurance is that when you, um, own a business, there's, there's a different type of disability that you, you should also carry. And it's called business overhead expense. So it'll cover your fixed business expenses. Might be rent, utilities, payroll, loan payments.

So the company keeps operating if you are to be disabled for a time being. Now, as we say that, we're gonna go back to what Eric said earlier, is that emergency funds. So you still have your personal emergency funds because most disability policies, they're, I'm, I'm really talking about long-term disability.

You know, if you break an arm, break a leg and you can't drive for a month, you need to have that emergency fund to, to segue, to help, to help cover that. Um, long-term disability really only, um, typically only covers 60% of the income that's [00:27:00] lost. So those emergency funds are even more important because that could stretch out much longer.

And then knowing that there's different disability. Coverages you can get for your business. Um, and you know, a lot of people are, um, not real thrilled with insurance, but it's one of those necessary evils. Um, I, I think I said it on one of the slides, like, you know what, you wanna buy an umbrella when the sun is shining.

You don't wanna try to, um, buy an umbrella when it's raining. Um, and insurance is one of those things that you have to get while you're healthy. Um, that's first and foremost. And, um, the younger the better. So today's better than tomorrow. 'cause tomorrow you're gonna be older. Um, but then the other, the other part of insurance that, um, Eric did touch on as well is that, that key person insurance, and this is gonna vary for whatever different business models, um, [00:28:00] but if there is.

A key person, and it might be you, um, you know, if you have a business partner, you know, your guys are gonna need to have key person insurance on each other. Um, that's, that's that protection. And, but if you end up, let's say, hiring someone who is, they're your, they're your golden child. They're your go-to.

They are what is helping your business grow. And, um, then key person on that individual, if it's a long-term, you know, if you think that's gonna be a sustainable relationship, that they're gonna stay with you. Um, there's times when that needs to be put in place as well. All right, you can go to the next one.

All right. Now everybody's best, you know, topic, right? Taxes. Um, one thing that I, I think is the most important when you start a business is to get your financial team. [00:29:00] Um, so to have your financial team in place, that would include a vetted CPA, um, you know, the CPA that you might've used, um, if you used one while you were an employee, might not be the one you want to use.

When you have a business, you want a CPA that really knows the ever-changing tax laws and how a business owner can and needs to take advantage of those and make sure they're getting all the deductions they need. Um, all, you know, all all the steps that need to be put in place so that the boxes are checked with the IS.

Um, but having your, your personal plan, you know, as we talked about earlier, having those retirement savings that's gonna help your tax situation. As a business owner too. So there's, you know, possibly maybe you're putting away, um, in a, in a Roth 401k while you were an employee. [00:30:00] But then when you own a business, you sit down with your CPA and your financial advisor and you know, your financial team and, and really crunch the numbers and it's, you know what, we need to put money away.

Pre-tax and, and we'll say a SEP account and, and that will really, you know, get that, that, that tax deduction that, that you, that you need for your business. Um, so it's, it's going to depend. Um, but that's why you need to have people who know what they're doing and that are consultative. Um, that's really important with the CPA, not just, okay, here's, here's my tax forms.

Tell me what I owe. Um, you're gonna want a CPA that's going to say, well, wait a second. Have you thought about, do you need, uh, you know, a larger vehicle for, to transport? These are you, you know, just all the things that you might not be thinking about, um, because that's not what you do day in and day out.

And, um, that's, you know, we [00:31:00] don't, we're not tax experts. Um, but we do team with them and, and that is something that I would. Um, highly encourage. Um, we do have some CPAs that, um, you know, that, that we can refer you to as well. Um, and dependent upon your area, um, you know, you might wanna get someone local.

Um, every state's different for that too. Okay, you can go to the next one, Eric. Um, and estate a plan. Estate planning. Um, this goes in line with what Eric talked about, the su succession planning, but I wanna even get down even more to the, the, the nitty gritty, you know, your wills and if you have, you know, a trust set up for your family or whatever you, whatever your family needs are, um, making sure that that business has been included in the plan and updated in that plan, even if it's not [00:32:00] profitable yet.

Even if you're in the early. Early years, you know, having that, um, correctly documented, um, is, is something that can't be overlooked. Um, and then having the succession plan, you know, and it's weird to think about now as, as I'm sure you're, you're, you're looking at buying a business, why do I wanna plan selling it or, you know, but, but planning with, beginning with the end in mind is, is always a key way to do things.

So, so just at least having that discussion, and, and again, this is gonna involve another financial teammate, which would be an estate attorney, um, and the estate attorney, you know, should communicate with your financial advisor. They should communicate with the CPA, like, again, it's a team so that all those experts work together on your behalf.

And that was it. I was, I was fast and furious [00:33:00] there.

**Eric:** Okay. Um, so, uh, I guess Kelly, you want me to talk about debt management? Mm-hmm. Okay. All right. Well, I'll, I'll carry it from here. So, um, uh, again, you know, debt management I think is obviously something that, uh, you know, you focus on as a, as a business owner, as I know many of you are gonna be, you know, going to SBA, uh, and, and taking on debt that way.

Um, you know, but those come with personal guarantees and things like that. So those are all. Things that we want to re reconcile into, like the personal financial planning side. What are the potential or the contingent, you know, liabilities, uh, and, uh, you know, what, what are the potential, uh, potential exposures for you from a personal standpoint if something doesn't work out with the business?

And, uh, you know, and again, it's easy to think, all right, well, you know, businesses are gonna, my [00:34:00] business is gonna, you know, go up, uh, in, in value over time. And my revenues, you know, and, and. To owners tend to be, you know, fairly competent at an and, and, and, and anxious at the same time. Uh, but I think it's really important to, uh, make sure that you're reconciling in, uh, debt exposures and what those kind of, those covenants are, uh, as well.

And, and also from a personal standpoint, if there's personal debt for other reasons that, you know, has attachments to other assets and things like that. Uh, again, that goes to a little bit to, you know, what, uh, Kelly said on the estate planning side. Uh, and, you know, protecting your assets. And there are ways to do that as a business owner, uh, that, uh, can protect your exposures on a personal side as well.

Uh. So investment diversification, I think kind of goes without saying. It really speaks to what I kind of alluded to before is, you know, you're one of your [00:35:00] biggest investments, uh, or investments to be for most of you is gonna be your business. And that's a very important investment. And obviously that's gonna have a growth track and you're gonna try to, you know, increase that value over time.

But, um, the, uh, investing in, uh, you know, other assets, I think it's gonna be, you know, very important. And as you, uh, you know, look, uh, you know, your retirement funds, that's obviously a, a, an important facet of that as diversifying, uh, your personal assets over time as well. And then, uh, long-term care planning, uh, I don't know, Kelly, if you wanna mention, uh, on long-term care planning.

'cause that's something that, uh, you've spent a lot of time on. Um. 

**Kelly:** Well, that, that, that goes in that insurance, in that fun insurance bucket. Um, the best time to plan for long-term care is, is when you're young and healthy. And, and when we, when we refer, and typically when I say we in the financial industry, long-term care doesn't mean, um, putting money for a [00:36:00] nursing home.

Um, what that term covers is your final years and those, those final years are going to be the most expensive healthcare years. And now you might die peacefully in your sleep. And that's kind of what everybody hopes. But, um, I think if we look at, um, even the, the, the tea leaves, if you will, um, it doesn't look like healthcare is going to get any less expensive anytime soon or maybe ever.

So, um, that long-term care planning is, is extremely important. Um. Particularly if you have, um, legacy desires. So we meet with a lot of clients that, that say, you know, we've worked so hard for this money, we've worked so hard. We wanna make sure we enjoy our retirement, but we really wanna maybe, um, pay for our grandchildren's education, or it really matters to us that we're [00:37:00] able to leave X, Y, Z.

This is what can put a stop in that desire. So covering, um, having some long-term care protection and there's so many different forms, like we could have an entire, um. Meeting on all the different forms of long-term care. Um, but I won't do that to you guys. Yeah. Um, there, but there's many different forms of it.

And, and I think the important thing for this discussion is just to know that, um, it's a, it's a risk and it's a risk that can, I, I almost wanna say easily, depending on your age and your health, it can be covered. And if that risk is, is, is kind of covered, then it's one, it's one thing you can just not have to worry about.

And, um, it will, it will certainly help out, um, if you're married, you know, that's a good, it's a good thing to help, um, spousals plan together for that. 

**Eric:** [00:38:00] Right. Thank you. Thank you. Um, really the next thing I've got a couple of excerpts and then I wanna get into, you know, basically retirement planning within the business.

But, um, you know, something that, that we do see from time to time is, uh, people get excited when they have a burst of success and then they do things kind of prematurely. You know, they, obviously, you want to, um, you know, you want to enjoy a life of, you know, prosperity and fun. You want to have fun while you're saving, you know, we certainly don't advocate people being, you know, such misers that they can't enjoy their working years just for the sake of like saving for retirement.

But, um, you know, it's, it is certainly, you know, important to understand that, that because business isn't. Linear, as I've alluded to that. Again, if you're contingency planning, but also goal plan to live within your means and not get carried away. 'cause we've seen a lot of, and quite a few occasions where, you know, a business has a good year [00:39:00] and then there's a lot of spending and lifestyle changes, new homes or second homes or lake houses and things like that.

Then unfortunately have to get, uh, like unwound And so like thinking over like business cycles and not just like from one year to the next. And, uh, so it is, it's not, not a huge point. Um, but it's still I think important nonetheless. Uh, see, I'm going to, uh, oh, well I will make a comment on this that I think it's important too that, um.

While you're in the business, that you have a fairly regular cadence on reviewing your personal financial situation. And Kelly mentioned, you know, who's on your business team. And having that consultative CPA is really important, not only on the front end to help you, you know, to judge the viability of your tax structure and your legal structure to make sure you're optimizing your tax situation, but also on the financial [00:40:00] side, you know, having a team that's helping you think through your financial plan and it's financial planning is not.

Something that you do one time and then, you know, okay, you get, you get a binder and you just put it up on a shelf. It's something that you nurture over time because business does change over time and the value of your business is gonna change. And so your inputs to your financial planning and, uh, and, and your financial productions are apt to change as well.

And so, um, you know, we certainly advocate, you know, having those frequent, uh, or regular, uh, think of a better, better term for it. Having those regular consultations to kind of work through, um, you know, any of those changes in some of the value inputs because, uh, you know, as we often say, you know, the quality of the data that goes in will help improve the quality of the data that comes out.

So with that, I wanna transition, transition into, Kelly mentioned this earlier about the, kind of the nuances of certain [00:41:00] retirement plans. And so what I would offer here is that when you get into your business, and, and many of you, I think most of you are like prior or current W2 employees. So I mean, some of this will seem fairly intuitive and we're gonna talk about the qualified retirement plan side first before we get into like non-qualified.

But, uh, again, on these, um, you, you wanna make sure that you have the right plan. And, uh, even though it may seem like one 401k might be, you know, not that different from the other, I would say that the design of that plan is pretty important. And some of it goes to how you incentivize your employees or reward your employees.

Um, and, uh, but I would suggest that once you get into the business again, this, and a nourish to your benefit as well too, it's, um, you know, doing a plan evaluation. Is this the right plan for us? And maybe looking, if you're buying a business that already has a plan, uh, it gives you an opportunity to kind of take a, a fresh [00:42:00] look, uh, and work with a consultant that can give you some feedback and some design suggestions.

Uh, again, to, again, it's, it's a, it's something that, you know, most companies feel is like a baseline benefit for employees. And obviously you want to be competitive when it comes to labor. Uh, but you know, there are different ways to design that plan, uh, particularly depending on your size, the number of employees you have, so on and so forth.

So when we look at the retirement plan types, and I know there's a lot of information on this page and this is like page one of two of qualified retirement plans and it's, uh, if I put everything on one page, y'all would probably throw large, uh, sharp objects at me. But suffice it to say there are different ways to do it.

So the two on this page is kind of a traditional 401k, which many of you are probably, you know, have participated in before. And so when you look at eligibility and key features, uh, you know, these were some of the design things that I was talking about. [00:43:00] Like, you know, depending on your demographics, you may have, uh, you know, may have younger employees that you know, may, uh, prefer or more entry level people that may prefer the Roth option, uh, you know, versus a pretext.

And, um, you know, there, there are pros and cons of this. Obviously the government. Uh, sets very, uh, you know, rigid, uh, contribution limits, as you can see here, uh, below the 401k is the simplified employee pension or the set. Uh, and again, that, you know, if you have, you know, that that can be for self-employed individuals, which I submit most of.

You're gonna be buying businesses where you're not gonna be the sole employee. Uh, but, you know, there may be benefits there because, you know, there are different contribution limits and different ways of, 

uh, 

algorithms on calculating that. Right? So, on a sep, you know, it can be up to 25% of your compensation, whereas on a 401k, it's, it's more of a fixed dollar amount.

And then you have, you know, [00:44:00] certain testing requirements there, uh, unless you're doing what they call a safe harbor plan. Uh, and, uh, but it may, that may or may not be the right thing for your business. Uh, you may. You know, find that you can, you know, maybe not afford to have a match at, at the current time, but it may be something in the future.

But again, all those things, uh, are, you know, the, when you, you know, get into your business, it's kind of a clean slate. You can look at it and reevaluate if you have a current plan, uh, for the company that you're buying into. Or if you don't, it gives you a golden opportunity to take a, a, a real long look at, at, uh, at how to, uh, how to build your retirement plan.

Because as much as this, remember as much as this is for the benefit of the employees, it's also for the benefit of you two. And, uh, uh, and so, you know, I think the best run companies are ones where, you know, uh, the, the leadership leads by example. The next [00:45:00] page here, uh, represents some other options. You know, another popular option if you have less than a hundred employees is called the simple.

Uh, and that's the savings incentive match plan for employees. And that has, you know, different contribution limits that are maybe not as, um, aggressive. You know, and again, if you're the owner and you, uh, have a business that's pro providing reasonable cash flow and is profitable, uh, you know, you're gonna be inclined to want to do, uh, the most that you can for yourself.

Uh, and some of these plans are easier to set up and maintain that others. But, uh, you see the, the solo K or the solo 401k down there, that's obviously if you're a, uh, you know, self-employed individual, again, most of you are not gonna be in that boat. And, um, uh, and then, uh, Keo plan, uh, you know, in between those two.

But, um. Again, these are defined, uh, and [00:46:00] regulated under the employment, uh, retirement, uh, security Act, uh, erisa, uh, 1974. And so there's a lot of rigor to these. There's. You know, there's a certain expense, you know, and, and you know, there are different ways you could do it. You know, you could find a bundled solution where you have both the record keeper and the third party administrator.

You can unbundle those and find different providers for each. And, uh, you know, there, there's a lot of, uh, uh, distance, I'd say between providers, uh, out there, you know, some that are really good, some that are efficient, some that, you know, provide a lot of service to, uh, plan participants and some that, you know, that don't.

So it pays to really spend some time, you know, looking at, uh, uh, looking at your options, looking at your design of your plan, and also putting, uh, you know, bids out and getting a lot of feedback from different providers to make the best decision that you can. Uh. [00:47:00] So there are alternative retirement plan approaches that can actually live side saddle to the qualified plan.

And so, you know, why do we have these? And so if you're the owner, uh, you know, you're looking at it on a lot of different levels. Obviously selfishly, you're looking at it for the potential to, you know, to provide additional resources for you to save more. Uh, again, this is a way if your business is, is, is profitable, it cash flows.

Uh, and you have the resources to, to do this. There are other options that are not in that qualified realm, that are governed by ERISA that have these very rigid reporting and compliance, uh, standards. And we'll talk about a few of these, but real quick, we wanna talk about, well, why, why do you wanna, you know, why, why would you have these?

And so from a hr, from a human capital standpoint, you know, certainly to recruit, retain, and reward top talent is, um, is, is [00:48:00] certainly one reason. I mean, we, we, we live in a very competitive labor market, and you want to, you know, keep your key talent intact. And obviously, you know, these plans can, you know, benefit you as well.

Uh, but you know, they're. Different ways to structure these different types of, these types, uh, of these plans that, you know, uh, that can be very important, uh, within your estate planning. Uh, the, you know, one advantage is that there's very low cost to put together. There's very little compliance that needs to be done.

Uh, and, uh, the maintenance is, is fairly standard. Uh, and, uh, so that, you know, when you think about regulatory considerations, um, you know, generally speaking, most of these are not governed by erisa, but there are some minimum reporting requirements on the front end, basically. And, you know, you have to put together an affidavit that says, yes, we have a plan and here's who [00:49:00] here who is covered.

Uh, but beyond that, you don't have to do things like prepare a a a 5,500 return and some of those onerous things that cost, that cost money, uh, but um. Let's talk about some of the options that you have. And so some of you may have heard of non-qualified retirement plans and you know, there's, uh, a lot of jargon here.

Um, but, uh, and this also has two pages of, of options. But when you think about yourself as the owner, you know, think about number one. So, you know, there is what is called a Section 1 62 Executive Bonus plan. So, you know, this is a plan. You know, there, there are multiple ways to look at this. Either there are plans, non-qualified retirement plans that keep money on your balance sheet.

And then there are those plans that actually get the assets off the balance sheet. And in the case of a section 1 62 Executive [00:50:00] bonus plan, um, this actually moves assets off the balance sheet to benefit either yourself as an owner, uh, you can benefit key employees, your officers. You can even have a section.

1 62 bonus plan for a director. Uh, and, um, the, the nature of non-qualified plans is different from qualified in the sense that not that qualified plans, you can't discriminate, you have to offer it to everybody. Whereas non-qualified plans, you are required to discriminate actually. And you create different classes.

Like you may have a, a a C C-suite like your C-E-O-C-C-O-O, uh, you know, CFO, you know, you may have those folks in a class. You may have key employees in a separate class, and you may even have, you know, a separate plan for yourself as the owner. But in this, in this case, a 1 62 plan, [00:51:00] you're basically, uh, ha the company is, uh, is paying you as the key employee, uh, a a sum which.

You can, you know, you can then invest in a properly structured and, and insurance product outside of the company, which, you know, you may, there, you may have some, you know, some restrictions on, uh, but, uh, but you ultimately control basically. And, um, and so, uh, and so that's, that's different from some of these other options.

But, you know, basically they're the contribution that's made to the executive to buy the properly structured insurance. Product, uh, if you will, uh, or that's a taxable event to the employee, uh, or the key person. But oftentimes the, uh, the company will essentially double bonus you to cover your tax and, and, and make you make you whole.

Now [00:52:00] you don't have to use an insurance. Uh, product, you can put it in a brokerage account. Uh, it's off balance sheet. So, uh, obviously if something happens to the company, a creditor can't come after it. Uh, and ultimately that, you know, uh, earns to the benefit of the, of the, um, of the participant in that plan.

And, uh, you know, but the advantage, the tax advantage. Uh, of using an insurance product for something like that is that you can take tax free policy loans or tax free distributions from that policy. Uh, as long as you don't put that, uh, policy into a, uh, you exhaust the cash value and you cause it to, to lapse, basically.

Um, but you know, there, there are some minimum requirements to make sure that you stay within, uh, the internal, uh, revenue code. Uh, section, uh, 4 0 9 A, uh, which again, no jargon Thursday here, but, uh, but that's just the part of the tax code that is pretty easy to [00:53:00] navigate, but the penalties are stiff if you, uh, don't structure it, right?

So generally speaking, you'd have an agreement with the company that'd be drafted by an attorney. Uh, you would, uh, provide just basic notice, basically an affidavit to, uh, uh, to, um, you know, department of Labor, uh, saying that you have this plan. And then, but there are no annual, uh, subsequent reporting requirements, uh, that are, that are required.

And, uh, then below that you have what they call a serp, which is a supplemental Executive Retirement Plan. Again, the company funds it and it's meant for high level executives. Uh, there are no contribution limits on any of these plans. Uh, and again, you can, uh, the difference here is that, you know, you, uh, keep those assets on the balance sheet.

And so if for something, if for some reason the company goes under a creditor, could attach. Uh, these, um, could attach to these assets. [00:54:00] You know, essentially this is a promise to pay, not a guarantee. Uh, so there is some risk to it. Again, if the company doesn't, uh, if the company doesn't make it, uh, you might have heard the term Top Hat.

And so this is kind of a top hat plan. So basically top hat being, you know, the, the highly compensated executive. So this is a, uh, essentially a potential perp for either you or your senior management team. Uh, and again, you can put this in a brokerage account. You can, um, uh, you can put it in, you know, uh, life insurance, what they call, uh, Coley or company owned life insurance that can grow internally.

And again, that's the tax benefit. Of using insurance for this is that, um, that money grows internally and then those distributions can be made, uh, on a taxed advantage basis. But the difference between, uh, 1 62 and a cert is that, you know, that those assets are held on the balance sheet of the firm. And so [00:55:00] there's, uh, not a, uh, there, there's a tax benefit, um, that occurs to the company when those distributions are made from that plan.

And then obviously the tax impact, uh, to the employee when those distributions are made. Uh, then there's non-qualified. Deferred compensation. Uh, you've probably, many of you have heard of deferred comp before. Uh, and there are different flavors of this, but again, this is just, you know, there's voluntary deferred comp where an employee can say, alright, 25% of my salary, I don't really need, I'd rather not have a tax event and have that paid to me now, I'd rather defer that and have it be paid at a future point in time.

Well, again, you're kicking the tax taxes of that distribution down the road. You're not, obviously not paying tax on, uh, what's being allocated to you if it's a, if it's a, uh, uh, certified non-qualified plan. But then there are other, uh, then there are other [00:56:00] flavors of, uh, non-qualified de deferred compensation, uh, that you can.

They, you know, the company can opt to contribute into that. So it's not just the employee that's deferring their own salary, but it's the company that's saying, we're gonna set up this plan and we're gonna contribute to it. You're not gonna receive it right now, but you'll receive it down the road. Uh, and again, that type of a plan, just like a cert, if something happens to the company, creditors can attach to that.

So again, that's a promise, not a guarantee. And then the last couple of, uh, you know, topics here are, you know, a split dollar arrangement, which also involves insurance. Again, no, IRS contribution limits. Um, although I have read, uh, cases where, uh. Plans where more than a million dollars has been contributed, have been at least challenged in tax court.

Uh, there's no stated minimums, but, um, you know, the, the IRS challenged, [00:57:00] uh, a couple of, uh, uh, plans that I'm, that I'm aware of on the basis of, uh, not being fair and reasonable compensation. Uh, but that's few and far, far between. But split dollar just means that, uh, you know, the company and the employee are both participating in the contribution to that plan.

And if it's using insurance, in this case, you know, if something were to happen to the key employee, the company could recoup the, uh, the premiums that have been paid on that employee's behalf, and then the beneficiaries of that employee. That is deceased would receive the, the rest of those proceeds. And then, uh, lastly, the executive bonus plan.

Uh, again, it's, uh, you know, it's very much like the section 1 62 plan, but the, the design of this is, um, is, uh, that your, uh, having assets that grow tax deferred that will eventually become, [00:58:00] uh, that become the property of the employee after a certain period of time. You could put a vesting schedule on that.

Uh, you can put, you know, they call this kind of the golden handcuffs type plan, but you know, again, that's very much like a section 1 62 plan, which kind of specifically, you know, focuses on the insurance side, on the insurance product side. Uh, but, uh, but in some, I'd say, you know, that there's just a lot of options available to you on the non-qualified side.

Uh, you know, I'm not here to say I, you know, promote, and I think this is a, the. You know, the best thing that sliced bread. But it is another option if you have a profitable entity and you're looking for additional ways beyond just a 401k beyond just taking distributions or dividends, right? Uh, if you're a C corp and you're taking dividends, you know those are gonna be double taxed.

But some of these non-qualified vehicles can provide a way, you know, whether, you know, yeah, you can save and [00:59:00] have it be either a net neutral tax impact or it's a deferred tax impact. Uh, but it provides you some additional income security above and beyond just taking your, you know, income, your income based cash flow or salary.

So last slide, and then we'll take some questions here is just, you know, kind of the, the path forward. And again, I realize that most of you are, uh, embarking on your journey. So, um, you know, to recap some of the things that I, that I've talked about, you know, that having that separation between business and personal, uh, finances, uh, very important 'cause it's easy to kind of get pulled into that, uh, tax planning, which Kelly alluded to.

Uh, you know, there are a lot of, you know, a lot of folks don't do this. And, and, you know, you know, a lot of businesses have very good CPAs that, that are, are, they have CPAs rather, that are very skilled in providing you a tax return, but they're not consultative. And so there may be things that you're leaving on [01:00:00] the table, uh, in terms of deductible expenses and things like that, that ultimately impact your own personal cash flow.

Uh, and then building personal wealth, you know, building the, your assets and your, you're well outside of the business. Understanding that most of you are gonna have the majority or wind up with a majority of your wealth that is tied up in the business. But to the extent you can try to diversify that through some of the vehicles that we've recommended and also just.

Personal after tax savings as well. Uh, and then risk management, which Kelly spent a lot of time talking about, that's very important. Uh, and then, uh, uh, uh, it may see odd, may seem odd to be talking about, you know, exit planning when you're not even in the business yet. But, uh, I think what that really speaks to is once you're in the business.

It's gonna be important for you to measure the value of your wealth that's in that business. So, you know, having a [01:01:00] periodic valuation I think is very useful. And we talked about that last time, but updating your inputs into your fi financial plan and always kind of refreshing that so you have, you know, at any one point in time, whether you're a year into your, you know, new business venture or you're, you know, 10 years into it, that you always have that view and that window into what that next, uh, iteration looks like.

And so, uh, and that just requires, you know, constant work. And like I said before, it's not a one shot deal. It's, you know, you start the process, but it becomes, uh, uh, what I call a marathon, not a sprint. And with that, um, you know, that kind of concludes the prepared remarks and, uh, I, I think we've got a couple of questions in the chat, but, uh, Athena, I'll turn it back over to you and, uh, uh, it's been a, been a pleasure and we'll look forward to, uh, taking some questions if there already.

**Athena:** This was awesome, Kelly and Eric. Uh, thank you. There's like [01:02:00] no end to things to learn in this space too, and I, I feel like I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm catching up, having spent 12 years out of the country and like not having access to these tax plans, so it feels like I'm a kid learning some of them for the first time.

But, um. Really fascinating stuff. Um, I, I saw Lisa had a question during the, um, insurance discussion. Lisa, did you get that question cleared up as as Kelly went on, or did you want some clarification? Not yet. 

**Lisa:** Um, yeah, I'm looking for clarification, so thank you both so much. Yeah. Kelly, I just, I wasn't sure if you were using the term umbrella as like a metaphor or if you were also talking about like, we should not only get life insurance, but disability insurance, key person insurance and an umbrella policy as well.

Could you clarify that for me? 

**Kelly:** Yes, absolutely. And, um, thank you. You're right. Uh, we use, um, umbrella as a [01:03:00] very important insurance. Product that does give very important protection. I was not referring to an actual umbrella policy. I was saying like over the whole umbrella of risk management. But since you mentioned it, uh, Lisa, I would say an umbrella policy is not a bad way to go.

Um, you, you know, it, it, it does make you increase your limits for your homeowner's insurance, your car policy, um, but it does provide a really good blanket of protection and for a business owner. You wanna protect your interests. Um, you know, there are some pretty nasty people out there and, and if they, they might see you have this successful business, even though you're back there working like a dog, right?

But they're like, oh, you know, oh, I see dollar signs. You know? Yes. An umbrella policy could come in very handy. [01:04:00] So while I wasn't saying that, now I'm, 

**Lisa:** I actually already have one. That's why it kind of like, uh, rings some bells for me. And then on the key person insurance, is that specifically life insurance for those key persons in your business, or is it disability, or is it both?

**Kelly:** It's specific to life insurance, yes. Okay. And it can be term policies, it can be permanent, it can be what, you know, whatever flavor. But what it is, is protecting, um, that if, if that person were to die, 'cause it does happen, um, then what would happen to that business. So it's extremely important when there's business owners, um, but you as a business owner are going to be the key person too.

Um, now we do know that disability happens more often than, you know, death, um, and can be [01:05:00] even more devastating. Um, so I know insurance. Insurance and taxes. Boy, Eric really left me the fun topics, didn't he? Fun stuff. 

**Lisa:** Uh. Did, did that help Lisa answer your question? That helps. And I'll keep going unless someone else has questions.

'cause I have list. No, please, by all means. But I just wanna point out 

**Athena:** that like I, I, I'm glad y'all got the memo that today was like, wear red day. Yeah. 

**Eric:** So I, I missed that obviously, 

**Athena:** kind of, but I got, I got the red there. So anyways, no, Lisa, please carry on with your questions. Love. These are great. 

**Lisa:** Cool. And then Kelly, you were talk, I think it was Kelly was talking about a percentage of profits that, um, we set aside for ourselves.

It, I know it's different for every business, but do you have like a rule of thumb, like, Hey, really minimum you should take 5%, 10%, whatever that happens to be. And I'm assuming that's, you know, [01:06:00] you take what you need to cover your monthly expenses and then on top of that, really you need to tuck away X percentage.

For either qualified or unqualified, uh, plans. 

**Kelly:** All the above. Yes. Um, and, and this is where that, that team comes into play. So not just in a financial, um, advisor, but, but also bringing in that CPA because that CPA can help out a lot with, well, hang on. Um, let's, you know, either you're gonna be an S corp or a C corp, you know, like kind of getting that structure for your business in place and, and saying, okay, well this is the amount of income that really you need to be taking.

We can deduct this amount. So I don't have a flat percentage. Um, I wish I do. I hate the answer. It depends, but it really does depend. Um, which is why, you know, and I, I just applaud you guys, [01:07:00] I applaud you for reaching out and, and getting all this information. I mean, Eric and I do this day in, day out, this is what we live and breathe.

So for you guys are looking at a business. Getting all this information now you are just gonna be miles ahead and I, I mean, I wish all of our business owner clients were doing what you're doing because Good for you. Um, there is so much to put in place, but it's also very exciting. Right. 

**Athena:** Um. It's super exciting and, um, Kelly, you don't know this about me.

My team definitely know this about me. Existing clients do, but new clients, uh, are, I'm known as the book lady to the team. So I have three book recommendations, um, that are really helpful to start wrapping her head around this. It does not replace getting advisors like this, but what I like to do myself is learn enough to get dangerous so that I can ask the right.

Questions and also make sure I'm choosing advisors that know [01:08:00] more than I do after I read a book. Um, in terms of the percentage of what you take, one of the, when I was a business consultant, I, I would have clients read this book. Um, it's a way of accounting as a business owner that it is on your day-to-day.

Most business owners are not checking p and ls. Um, you know, if you hire a bookkeeper, they're not reconciling for like a couple months afterwards. Um, oh, Lisa disappeared. Uh, I was, I was talking to Lisa about this in particular. Um, I'm 

**Lisa:** here, I'm here. 

**Athena:** No worries. Edit's, kind of doing, uh, control of like who's, whose faces are showing.

Um, but, uh, when, when, um. Business owners do not manage their, their businesses and their financials by looking at profit and loss statements, um, on a day-to-day basis, even though they're helpful statements to do, you know, planning and that sort of thing. So like your bookkeeper will reconcile it a couple months after it happens.

So what most [01:09:00] business owners do is they check their bank account to see how much money they have to be able to spend. Um, so, and it's not a good, right, but like when you're a small business, having somebody like actually keeping your books up to speed, et cetera, et cetera. So this has been a really phenomenal, like in between doing your quarterly check-ins with your financial team, et cetera, et cetera.

This book kind of talks through a way to manage your finances as a business so that you're siphoning off the money that you need. Um, but what, what he talks about and the concept that I think is interesting and, and something I was gonna point out on this overall discussion is you. You spend as much as you give yourself to spend.

So what most business owners do is they don't leave anything at the end to pay for themselves to pay for taxes or to even give themselves any sort of profit. They'll just spend everything on operational expenses, et cetera. So this concept is taking your profit out first and doing [01:10:00] almost like the, um.

The envelope system through your bank accounts of siphoning off money for taxes, he recommends 15% of your overall revenue. Si, you know, siphoning off profit, even if it's 1%, you know, in every quarter you have that little amount of money that you're like, I was profitable. But like, if you put it all into spending it on expenses in the business, the, the, the chances of you having enough leftover for taxes and for paying yourself is, is little.

Um, so anyways, I, I'd recommend this book, another book, uh, this one has been really good tax free wealth to, to understand all the things that are available. Eric, I was laughing when you were saying that CPAs are really gonna hand you a tax return. Like, it blows my mind how many CPAs do not understand tax strategy.

Um, and 

**Eric:** unfortunately 

**Athena:** it's or frustrating, right? Because. Um, one of the things that, that I am, I'm so angry about at this [01:11:00] country and our system and everything is that business owners are not rewarded for stockpiling money, right? And making sure that they have enough runway. You keep money and you get taxed on it.

So even if you don't spend the money, if you make that money and you keep it, you're gonna get taxed on it. So then it means that owners are incentivized to spend money, so they're not paying taxes unless they use folks like Eric and CPAs that actually know what they're doing in terms of tax strategy to at least put the money in places where they can try to keep some of it.

Um, and the last one is, is a really great one. Just try to understand personal wealth situation. And I like using these as tools so that when I come to people like Eric or I have a tax strategist myself that I work with, that I can be a better client to them because I, I, they're not having to teach me the basics.

I understand the basics enough to have a conversation with 'em about it so we can apply that knowledge and actually take action in it. So I hope, I hope I didn't make any recommendations that y'all wouldn't agree [01:12:00] with, but I think these are good support systems before you start 

**Kelly:** using folks like them. No, those are fabulous.

The profit First, I will just, I'll just add in. I'm a big audible person, so I don't know who listens to Audible. Um, profit First is a better read than it is a listen, and I, I don't wanna down, I don't wanna down the person who gave, who, who, who, who read it on Audible, but I'm gonna encourage you to read that book instead of listen to it.

**Athena:** That's so funny. I actually loved listening to it. That's cute. It was the author himself. Yeah. But I know he's a fun personality. Yeah. 

**Kelly:** I was like, he likes his voice. 

**Eric:** Yeah. Usually the, the, the author reading is probably not the way to go, but, 

**Kelly:** well, 

**Athena:** I'm glad you liked it. Now 

**Eric:** they have ai, now they 

**Tom:** have ai, the narration, so Yes.

**Athena:** Yeah. 

**Tom:** Uh, this is Tom. I, I was just gonna chime in with something that, uh, to [01:13:00] reiterate something that Eric had covered, uh, early in the, uh, presentation. And I think it's important, especially for a lot of folks who have a W2 type situation, which is very plannable, um, that you may want to, you have to ultimately.

Retain your flexibility. Um, if you, if you get onto a plan where I'm gonna save this much, save this much, um, the business might not, uh, support that. The economy might not support that. So you gotta read the room constantly and be ready to shift gears. Um, you don't want to trap yourself in a situation where you think you can take this much money out all the time and, and you got kind of used to that in a W2 type situation.

So, um, you know, cash flow is king and businesses, and, [01:14:00] and so you always want to, you know, first and foremost make sure that, uh, you are treating or, or that you're earning the cash flow that you need to keep the lights on. 

**Athena:** Yeah, I absolutely agree. I, I think cashflow management, and we know this, right, like it's the, it's the thing that takes people in the first couple years of buying a business, when they're not preparing for the J curve and the cashflow crunch that they might experience there for new businesses, the thing that that kills 'em is not managing their cash flow.

And Eric, I can't remember the stat that you had in your very first slide. I remember it from the last one. It's like most business owners don't have more than a month. Runway on hand. Like, I mean, it's just, it's painful reading that and thinking about that, that like most businesses are one month away from, you know, having to shut their doors if they don't have enough cash flow on it.

Yeah, 

**Eric:** well that, that, that was laid bare during the pandemic. And, uh, I mean, I have a personal testimonial 'cause I was part of a, a group, uh, where our city that I'm [01:15:00] currently on, city council of, you know, gave money to the chamber in partnership to dole out to businesses that, uh, and some were, you know, many were very much in the wheelhouse of the target, two to 10 million that we're talking about here.

And, you know, not only were, you know, the financial statements, uh, the integrity, the financial statements lacking, uh, or really just a basic understanding. People may have really understood the business. But not had a financial background. And so, but they weren't preparing. And you know, the odd thing now is that I see a lot of short-term, short-termism on memories.

You know, people remember okay, you know, in 2022, you know, people were like, oh, I've gotta have a contingency plan. Oh, I need to, you know, 

you know, 

reserve, have reserve funds, you know, but then, you know, economy improves and they tend to forget those things. So it's like you, I think you almost have to like constantly reevaluate, make that part of your strategic plan.

You know that you're right, you're waiting your cash flow needs and you know, [01:16:00] and your reserve requirements and make that a part of your strategic thinking. 

**Athena:** But it's just infuriating that like reserving money, you know, is, is a taxable event when that's the thing that's gonna actually help you be successful at a, as a business.

Like, oh, it's the end of the year now I gotta figure out where to put all this cash that I actually need for January because I'm gonna get, you know, taxed for it if I don't do it otherwise. So that's just me griping and getting on my soapbox about it. Obviously there's a ton of strategies that you could do to try to mitigate against this.

Um, Lisa, I saw you had another question, so please, by all means, what's, what's your question? Sure. 

**Lisa:** Yeah. Athena, you told us to get selfish and, uh, ask about our specific situation. So here's my situation. Um, so I've got a partner, um, we currently have a holding company, LLC, um, and our business will go under that LLC and if we buy others, we'll put them under that LLC.

We [01:17:00] also each have living trusts. Set up right now, the holding company is in our names personally, and I wanted to get some advice on should the holding company be in the names of our living trust instead, or, I've also heard potentially that the trust could be a beneficiary of the holding co. What's your thought on that?

If, if that's up your alley? 

**Eric:** Mm-hmm. Well, the first caveat is that we're not attorneys and, and we don't play 'em on TV either. So, fair enough. Careful about now. I mean, it sounds like you have, you have an attorney relationship, um, that helped you set up those trusts and I think that's 

**Athena:** mm-hmm. 

**Eric:** A good thing.

Now you gotta, you know, think, okay, well are these, what's the, what are the reasons, right? I mean, you're trying to asset protect. Are you trying to be able to pass the wealth that's accu accumulated within those trust into [01:18:00] the next generation? And, you know, are they yes. You know, revocable or, you know, irrevocable because that has, you know, some, some ramifications too, right?

Because if they're revocable, then you have some measure of control over it and think about, you know, like some currently 

**Lisa:** revocable. Yes. 

**Eric:** Yeah. So, um, but then, uh, you know, if you're the trustee and an irrevocable trust, you know, obviously. Something happens to you, you have to make sure, like, because in business decisions, if you have entities that are held within that structure, there has to be a mechanism for, you know, uh, you know, for, for decision making and how the business interests are to be, you know, distributed.

Uh, so, you know, but that's, I mean, it's a great case study and I'm, and I, and I applaud you a again, for forward thinking about those types of things, you know, but like I, I think, uh, honestly, attorney and your tax, do you have a tax professional 

Yes. 

As well. That is that person kind of consultative as [01:19:00] well.

**Lisa:** I'm not sure he is the greatest. That's okay. 

**Athena:** Very common. They're so hard to find if he's, 

I'd love some 

more recommendations. 'cause my tax strategist helped me figure out how to like, make my clothing and hair nail appointments actually, like legitimately tax deductible around the events and that sort of thing.

'cause it's so, it's not for everyone. Like they're my flavor, but they're not gonna be for everybody. Um, so I'd love some more rec because I'm scouring trying to find people like who actually knows, you know, the, what is it, 7,000 pages of tax code and how to apply it at, at an individual level rather than a CPA.

And it's like, what were your expenses? Okay, here's your tax return. Right? Um, so yeah. Yeah. 

**Lisa:** So, so if I'm hearing you correctly, Eric, I think, uh, the takeaway would be, go back to the estate attorney that originally set it up because we didn't, we weren't. We weren't doing anything about business buying when we set up the trust.

[01:20:00] Right. So, um, go back to the estate attorney and also run it by the cpa. 

**Athena:** Mm-hmm. And 

**Lisa:** if, if he can't provide any consultation, find one that can and, uh, and collaborate with them to find out the best setup. 

**Eric:** Yeah. And, and I think it's important too, somebody that has experience, you know, because, I mean, there are a lot of people that are very skilled in just drafting a document, right.

I mean, we see, unfortunately, a lot of estate attorneys that put together trust and then they wind up not getting funded. And, you know, I mean, a trust is only good for the assets that it, that are, you know, housed within it. And, you know, in this case it's, it's important to like, what are the things that could happen that could cause the cause problems?

And like an experienced estate attorney will know those traps. I mean, the young attorneys are probably, you know, they'll, okay, well here's, I'm gonna charge you this much [01:21:00] for this document, and then when it's done, you know, here you go and have a nice day. But, you know, to really, I mean, the experienced ones are gonna know where the landmines are if you set it up this way and this happens.

Right. Have you thought about that? Right. And then just like the, the, you know, the, the issue that I mentioned, if you have an entity underneath the trust and you die, have you named a a trustee? And if. You know, if that person is with you and you both go together, then who's your successor trustee and what powers do they have to execute, you know, business sale or business interest documents, and especially if you have a partner, right?

And that creates a, a new layer of complexity. 'cause it's not just one owner, it's two owners. And so how is that accomplished? And, and then that gets you into key person insurance and buy, sell coverage, which will compensate and allow the other owner to, you know, buy your, your partner to buy you out if, or buy your estate [01:22:00] out if something happens.

Or buy out the trust if that business is held within the, you know, uh, within the trust. So I know I'm probably begging more questions than I'm answering with that, but, uh, I 

love it. But that's 

why, I mean, the planning is really, is really important and it's unfortunate, but I've been doing this long enough where I've seen.

Instances where people thought that they had really like airtight planning, and then all of a sudden they became the exception. And so what they thought they had or what their heirs thought they had in place, uh, you know, became, for lack of a better term, kind of a, like a hairball for them to have to deal with.

And so, um, yeah, that, that's my response to that. So you're asking great questions and again, I applaud anybody who's gone through some t some measure of estate planning, uh, is, is, you know, is great 'cause most people don't. If you wanna add to that. 

**Kelly:** Yeah, I would just add if you, 'cause as soon as you said that [01:23:00] you had set that up and you hadn't had the business planning, it wasn't even in the, the thought process yet, then that was like, oh, go directly back to that, to that estate attorney.

That's exactly what you need to do. Hey, we set these up. Now our life has changed because that's what life does. Life changes. And so that's the other thing. So now what we set up, now what we're doing, does it work? 'cause it might not, and you're gonna have to be okay with that. If you have to change the trust structure, then you change the trust structure, you know?

But that, that estate attorney, hopefully, as long as there is, they're good. Um, we, we'll hear you out and we'll hear out. You know, they should be asking you the questions like, what are, what are your concerns? You know, what are the things that, if you're laying, if you're, keeps you up at night, gosh, well what if I get hit by a bus and we just bought this business?

And what, you need to be able to voice [01:24:00] those things and make sure that all the what ifs have been heard. That doesn't mean they're gonna get solved in one day, but they need to be heard and then planned with. 

**Lisa:** Yeah. I love that. Awesome. Thank you both so much. Uh, this has been incredibly valuable. 

**Athena:** Oh, thank you.

Thanks. Thanks, Lisa. 

**Lisa:** Um, 

**Athena:** so I, I know we're at time. There's, uh, so many other topics that I feel like I could dive into and, and I won't. Um, but one of the things like I kind of wanna wrap it all up on is, is we're obviously talking to everybody here as, as becoming new business owners and things to think about and there's clearly a lot to plan for.

And, you know, if you're using SBA and something happens to you, guess what? SBA is gonna get their money 'cause they're making you take out a life insurance policy. You cannot get the SBA loan without one. Right? So it's like if they're doing that for you. What are you doing to plan [01:25:00] for your, you know, their, their contingency planning.

So really important to do, uh, this kind of planning as a new business owner. Get the right team behind you. You know, we, we have enough, but I mean, my brain was still melting trying to figure out the differences between the retirement accounts. So it's like, I know the terms and kind of what I wanna achieve, but I need people to help me set all that up.

So I'll probably be talking to you separately, Eric and Kelly. Um, but, uh, you know, when, uh, all of us are talking to business owners that are trying to sell, and so when we understand from the flip side of it. Most of them probably haven't done this kind of planning. Most of them thought they were gonna have a retirement outcome that they're not going to get as part of the sale.

70, 70% of people that sell, you said are, are unhappy with the sale outcome. So it also helps us get into the mindset of the sellers when we're doing these transactions. Like, um, you know, the, the reason why they're [01:26:00] acting the way that they are is because they, this was their plan. This was their retirement.

This was what they did, and they probably didn't get the right people around 'em like yourselves early on to, to make sure that the, um, proceeds from the sale were not the only thing that we're gonna take care of 'em for the rest of their lives. So, um. You know, good, good food for thought as you're dealing with the sellers in your transactions, like understanding their situation.

And it might help create a little bit of empathy and or, you know, just at least commiserate with them on, on that process or even structure something that might help them out in that regard. Like, you know, how seller financing could provide them additional money over an amount of time and that sort of thing.

So anyways, um, this was awesome. Super fascinating as always. Uh, hearing from Eric and, and Kelly, great to, to meet you and hear from you as well. Um, so much to talk about. We'll absolutely be sharing your details and the slides so that as people are looking to navigate this, they can get in touch with you to talk about their [01:27:00] personal situations in more detail.

Um, and yeah. Any other final thoughts before we sign off? Important last words. 

**Eric:** Yeah, honestly, you know, again, thank you for the opportunity. It's, it's great to visit with you and I'm excited for, for, for all of you on the line, you know, um, you know, jumping into this and, you know, speaking as a business owner, I mean, this is something that I knew when I was 25 that I wanted to, and I'm a little bit older than that now, but I mean, I was able to achieve my goal and, you know, it's, again, business is not linear and, you know, you know, I knew that going into it, but you know, when you least expect it, expect it.

But, you know, it's fun. But you, you gotta think about yourself too. And it's not just the financial planning side of it, it's taking personal time and enjoying the ride along the way. And, you know, there are some days that I get bogged down, I gotta do this, I gotta negotiate this contract, I gotta deal with this vendor, I've gotta deal with this client and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

You know, uh, all of that. But then [01:28:00] you realize, gosh, I'm doing what I want to do, right? I mean, I'm living. The, the goal and the dream that I want. And you know, and I've got two of my colleagues here and I have other awesome colleagues and I just love working with, with them. And so, you know, it's a real blessing to me.

And so, you know, I, I think take stock all of you, uh, you know, when you get into the business, uh, you know that this is your dream and obviously you're committing a big financial resource to it. So, you know, it becomes like, you know, that, that the SBA loan becomes like a set of old luggage. You, it's just there.

You can't get rid of it, right? But, but, but the business itself and operating is, is, is fun. And then just enjoy it along the way and don't take, don't miss the opportunities to, you know, to celebrate life, uh, amidst it. Right. And, and just understand, again, if you're able to do some of these strategies and save and, uh, and provide for the future, it gives you more flexibility to enjoy the moment, right?

I've seen some people that have, you know, that have worked [01:29:00] so hard and they, they're misers in their, in their lifetime that they can enjoy it. And then, and then they get to retirement or they sell their business and then they're, you know, then they, they have bad arthritis. They can't move around, so they can't travel, and then they're not able to enjoy their, their wealth.

And it becomes like, well, what was the purpose? Right? So enjoy the moment. 

**Kelly:** I like that. That was good, Eric. That was really good. 

**Athena:** Yes, a good reminder for us all, myself included. So thank you so much. This is such a fun game. We get to play that we get to look at how we can buy a business, become business owners.

Being a business owners is a thrill. I actually am glad you said that and it's interesting how things come in themes, but I was thinking about that recently, like I need to bring the fun back into this 'cause this is fun. You know, we're doing, doing stuff that's adventurous and that nobody else is trying to do and it is a hell of a lot of fun.

So, um, thank you for leaving it on that note. [01:30:00] Perfect way to end it. Thank you so much for your time. Thank you everyone for joining today. Um, always good to see you. We'll see you next week, next Thursday we're gonna have financial statement basics. We're gonna be going with p and ls and balance sheets, like yeah.

Um, so I'm super excited about it. Um, and we'll see you all next week and have a great week and day. In the meantime, thank you.
