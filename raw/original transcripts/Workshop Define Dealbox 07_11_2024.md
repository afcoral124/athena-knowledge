# Workshop 4: Define Dealbox 7/11

**video1681647481\_edit\_c2:** [00:00:00] Hello. Welcome. Welcome. I am so excited to talk about one of my favorite topics, which is programming your GPS. So as you're joining us, I'd love to take a couple moments to let people filter in. But while we're doing that, let me know where you are located in this beautiful world of ours. And also give me a little code in terms of where you're at in your business buying situation.

So one on one is if you're brand new to business buying and it's like, you don't really know much about this concept yet. Two Oh two is you understand this concept. Maybe you've dabbled and looked at some listings advanced would be, maybe you've made an offer or gotten into due diligence, but obviously you've bought a business own.

If you're a current business owner, some of these might apply to you. You might be a business owner who's also dabbling and looking at making some acquisitions. So amazing. Loving seeing all this. Yeah. Coming through, lots of familiar faces. If you're feeling brave, you can turn on your cameras, too. You know, those [00:01:00] nods really help when I'm trying to, like, give energy to a computer screen.

But if you've been with me before, you know I get a little bit hyper because this is one of my favorite things to talk about. So we're gonna get into it in just a minute. Amazing, we've got Vancouver, Zach in Portland, where is MSP? I don't know what that stands for. Minneapolis, St. Paul, maybe?

Making that up? Okay, we've got some owners. We've got Western Canada. So Canada's with us today. Cool. South Carolina, Bellevue, some 101s, 202s. Awesome. I'm loving this. All right. So some more 202 is great. Great. Amazing. So oops, there we go. It's always a little tech at the beginning. I have these nails and they make my, my clicker go back.

So we'll see how many Near misses [00:02:00] I have. Rashmeen Austin amazing. Rashmeen owns a couple businesses, she's amazing. So cool. This is intended as an intermediate 2 O 2 discussion. So I'm not gonna get too deep into what is But if you're brand new to this and you'd like a session on it, you can write one on one in the chat and still hang out.

We're planning a one on one session soon where we're going to just break down what is this space? What's the opportunity? Is it something that you'd want to get involved in? And it's aimed at people that are self funded searchers. So you're funding your own search to acquire a business. Or you're a business owner that wants to acquire a business, but you're a small business owner.

So this isn't designed for investment groups and that sort of thing, private equity. Larger funds because I'm going to be talking about mostly utilizing SBA government money as we go through this, but you're more than welcome to hang out. There might be some things that come into this, but this is aimed at an individual that's looking to buy a [00:03:00] business and be a business owner.

So yes, there will be a replay. We'll send it out in an email tomorrow. I'm going to go through a bunch of stuff, so you probably will want to revisit it at some point when you go through your deal box in your own time. So just really quickly, let's remind ourselves what this SMB ETA opportunity is, right?

So SMB stands for small medium businesses, but it's also the acronym that's been used to describe. This kind of phenomenon, which has been around for, you know, ever, but people are catching on to it. I see you, my real estate folks that are joining us in the business world. But S and B is what's, you know, used to describe, buying businesses, small businesses, and ETA stands for entrepreneurship through acquisition.

So rather than starting a business. We can buy a profitable one. And this was something that hit me like a lightning bolt when I was going through my journey. When I know for a fact [00:04:00] that 96 percent of new businesses do not make it to year five, right? Starting a business is an incredibly harrowing journey.

I have the graveyard to show for it. And of those businesses that make it only 5 percent of businesses make it over a million in revenue. So when we're looking at businesses that have been in existence for over five years that have over a million in revenue, we know we're looking at. The top, you know, of the top of businesses and the likelihood of them being around to stay.

The other thing that's happening, you might've heard this phrase, the silver tsunami. We have 10, 000 people that are hitting retirement age every single day. And for the next 20 years, 19 percent of those folks or more, depending on what stats you're looking at are business owners, but more importantly, three quarters of those businesses are profitable.

So buying a profitable business. That's been in existence. It's likely to be in existence rather than starting a business knowing that only 4 percent of you are [00:05:00] going to make it to your five. And even if you do, you know, the burnout or the strife might might be too much. So the other thing that's really cool, and I was just listening in on a conversation about this, but there is government money available.

For you to buy this business. So for the equivalent of a down payment of a house, you can buy a cash flowing business. And again, looking at you real estate folks, the returns on businesses are pretty insane. So you can sometimes put zero money into these deals of your own money. It's a lot rarer, but the average and all the, all the SBA asks you for, which is the government entity that provides these funds is 10%.

So for 10% you can buy a hundred percent of the business. And when we're looking at the types of investments and the types of returns, and then. Weighing up the risk of those E. T. A. Entrepreneurship through acquisition is performing it double the rate [00:06:00] of real estate, right? Which is, you know, why so many people from real estate are looking at businesses because real estate is a long play, and it doesn't necessarily cash flow venture capital.

I always call this when I say asset class, I mean, buying businesses. So forgive the finance term. But when you're looking at venture capital, which is just pumping a bunch of money and betting that one of those is going to pay off and be the next uber or the next unicorn, the risk is very, very high because they're betting on a bunch of.

You know, future projections. So with buying businesses, we're getting VC like returns with the risk profile of real estate. As long as you buy a profitable business, it's been an, you know, you got to look at all the parameters of the business and make sure it's good and also make sure that you're the right buyer for that business, but pretty incredible returns that we're seeing.

So, you know, there's a lot of Internet hype that you're going to be able to walk up to a business buying vending machine [00:07:00] and press a button and a business is going to arrive that you get to then go sit on a beach while this business cash flows money to you. So this is what the Internet's telling you right now.

And even more so, like, without having a direction, right, without programming your GPS, without knowing what kind of business that you're looking for, this is the reality of what buying a business looks like. The search is one of the hardest parts, so is the process, and if you haven't programmed your GPS, you're going to get lost, you're going to burn out, or if you buy the wrong business, you know, you can bankrupt yourself.

So how will you know if you find the right business if you don't know what you're looking for, right? So getting your deal box right is essential to having a successful acquisition and going through this process successfully. So what is a deal box? It is a clear plan that outlines the kind of business that you want to buy.

So think of it like a map to guide you, right? It's programming your [00:08:00] GPS and giving you a map on how to get there. And It helps you immensely if you're not sure what kind of industry, what kind of business that you want to buy, you still want to have clarity on a bunch of other parameters, which is what we're going to get into today.

So why do I need a deal box? You know, yeah, you can go out there and you can just, you know, spray and pray on looking at the businesses that are available, but when you have a deal box, it gives you focus. So you don't get lost along the way, it gives you efficiency in their search. So if you know what you're looking for, it's a lot easier and quicker to get there, right?

You're not getting lost. You're going to be able to identify the one a lot more quickly, and you're going to have the confidence to move forward. So one of the things that I see people do all the time is they're not really Set or they haven't gone through the process of refining their deal box, so they don't move on these opportunities because they're just not sure if it's right for them or not.

Right, so we can sabotage ourselves in the process. [00:09:00] Hello, my name is Athena Simpson. I'm an acquisition matchmaker and I am a fellow searcher. Searcher is what we call us. We're searching for a business to buy. So my background, Ooh, I got my microphone there. I got to be careful. Sorry if I just give you a shock.

My background started in corporate like many of you. I was what we call an intrapreneur when I started. So I used other people's money within these corporate entities to set up new business functions and new product lines. So I did that at two award winning marketing agencies, B Corp in Los Angeles and Liberty in London.

And I also set up the internal agency and event. Products that we licensed out and franchised out all over the world for Guinness world records. Yes, the book. And while I was doing that, I wanted to be an entrepreneur. Like even though I was creating these products and feeling like an entrepreneur, I still had to answer to other people and other things and be told no.

And I'm really bad at being told what to do. So [00:10:00] I started my first business, which was a food business and I knew nothing about the food industry and I literally did everything wrong with that business, but it made me really passionate about helping other people who are entrepreneurs. And so my next business was, Consultancy for equity ended up becoming a partner in the world's largest food tech community.

We have thousands of startups that we're starting technology and innovations to help the food space. And through that, we advise the investment community. So everything from angels through to sovereign wealth. And then we also advise the corporate entities that touched into the food industry on how to innovate, work with startups.

And I sat on advisory teams for M& A acquisitions of startups. So I was aware from like private equity and, from corporates on doing acquisitions, but it kind of blew my mind when I found that individuals were buying businesses. So I, I've been a business consultant for 10 [00:11:00] years. And if you know, road mama, then, you know, a long story I won't get into here, but that is a nickname that has not escaped me since.

Working. Oh, you can't see behind me, but I worked in the music industry to start my career. I did a high performance coaching business. I was a lecturer at the Texas McComb school of business here in Austin, Texas on entrepreneurship. So I love entrepreneurship and I love businesses. And through my own experience, I discovered that you could buy a business, which made so much sense because I could apply the things that I was helping others with.

And I get the upside. I get to run the business and I don't have to go through the harrowing journey of starting a business. And figuring out product market fit and how to sell the customers like somebody else already figured that out. So I started Unrestricted Ventures. Most of my experience has been client facing.

These are some of the entities that I have worked with over my career and advised and seen inside the businesses of, so everything from governments to small businesses [00:12:00] to well funded startups to, you know, FTSE 100 and Fortune 500 companies. I don't say that all to brag. It's just to give you a bit of my background and what I'm going to tell you in detail a little bit later is my own searching journey.

So I ended up finding this world. I was just obsessed with it. I went hard. I. Was hosting events. I was doing direct mail. I was doing email outreach. I was turning up at business owners doors to talk to them. I was getting listed in the paper, like anything I could just source deals. I was doing it and I ended up finding the one, right?

And it was so much bigger than I ever had initially conceived. I ended up having to raise 3 million. In five days over Labor Day weekend in equity to be able to have a shot at this deal because it was an 8 million, purchase price that I was offering well. I didn't know I was [00:13:00] capable of that. I did raise the money and I ended up losing it to a strategic investor who just knew structuring better.

They'd played this game longer and I lost out on the perfect business for me because I didn't know enough about how this process worked. And I'm still grieving that loss to this day, but I don't like losing. So two things happen. One, I went out and made as many capital relationships as I could. It's been capital money, right?

Like who could potentially fund future deals. And I learned as much as I could about the financial tools available in the toolkit to an individual like me who doesn't have a fund available, who doesn't have a whole private equity team. So how can we as individuals, Be competitive in a very competitive market to be able to buy a business that we are the right owners for.

We are the right people to take on that business. So I got obsessed with financial structuring and it's something that I'm just constantly obsessed with. Like literally right before this call, I was listening in on like SBA lenders talking about the market. And then the other [00:14:00] thing that happened was I had all these investors that still wanted businesses to buy.

Right. And I was like, okay, I. Want to search. That's all I want to do. So I pitched them. I was like, Hey, what if I ran your search for you? And fast forward to today? Here we are with ACLI batch. We are a personalized SMB search and match service. It's a white glove concierge service for people that are too busy or have too many commitments to be able to run their search themselves.

So we do a very extensive deal box refinement sessions. You're going to get a very small sliver of that. Our process takes over a month. is very extensive with me and my team. We then take that deal box and go out and look on and off market for opportunities. So on market means it's through a broker and then off market means that we are reaching out directly to business owners to see if they want to sell.

Once we identify these opportunities, we analyze and vet the opportunity, not only to see if it's a [00:15:00] good business, but is it the right business to For you, for our client. And once we do that analysis and vetting, we then hand over these opportunities to our clients. So they are spending their very limited time on moving deals forward.

So if we pass over an opportunity, we think it has the potential to be the one. So they're only spending time speaking to owners. Sending LOIs and going into that process. And then along the way, we're there to consult and support on how do I structure this with SBA? What do I need to put in the LOI?

The owner came back and said this, how do I negotiate this point? Who do I hire for my lawyer or for my financial due diligence or insurance due diligence, or what lenders should I go to? So we support with all of that. And it was a service that I wish was available and we are. Taking on new clients now because all of our original clients are under offer.

So we've had 100 percent success rate, which I'm really proud of. So two of my team members are here today. That's not just me. And [00:16:00] honestly, they do the majority of the really hard work. So we have Anca here who's created our operations. And she's created some of the most beautiful systems for us to be able to process and look at.

An exceptional amount of deals and then Ryan who comes to us from empire flippers, which was the largest online vetted business brokerage for online businesses. He himself listed, analyzed and vetted over 80 million worth of deals in 22 alone. So we are so grateful to have him and he's finding absolute smokers for our clients.

And then Masam heads up our data and lead gen team. So if you don't have clean data, you're not starting from a good point and also All of the A. I. Tools out there to find leads. They don't work in small business land. You know, a lot of these business owners don't even have emails or linked in. So how do you find them?

So that's what Masam heads up on our team. Okay, what are we covering today? Y'all are here because you want [00:17:00] clarity on your deal box. So, I can't go through the whole month long process with you, but what I want to go through is first a reality check around the deal box, right? Like, I am known in this, in these circles, I'm getting known as the dream killer, and I love that because I would rather kill your dreams Then see you bankrupt yourself.

Okay. So with a reality check for you, if you're still highly motivated after this and you're aware of the challenges you're about to face, you are likely going to be a good business owner because once you buy that business, I can't tell you the manner of things that are going to come up. Even if it is an established business, you're still going to have to deal with stuff.

So if these challenges and this reality check doesn't scare you, you are in the right place. If it does scare you, you still have an opportunity to participate in this, but I would suggest you be an investor rather than buy your own business and operate it. So then we're going to talk about the deal box refining process, right?

This is the process that [00:18:00] we go through with our clients. So you can take some of that onto your own. And then I'm going to talk through my journey in detail and it's not to big myself up, but just to show you what a journey looks like when you're refining that deal box and getting braver and getting more confident and learning more things as you go on.

And then we're going to talk about how you can apply that to your own deal box refinement journey. It's not something you do in an hour. It's. It's not something you just write a list or fill out a checklist for. And then at the end, we'll have some Q and A. So I get really excited about talking about this stuff.

I am going to try to keep it to an hour and allow for some questions, but we'll stay on after an hour and answer all of your questions about this or anything else. So for those of you that are hyped up and want to stay with us, we will stay around. So let's start with the reality check. We're in. I was thinking about this today and I don't know if I should say this or not because I haven't heard anyone else say it, but I think we're in a bull market right now for buying businesses.

Like the internet's going crazy. You have tons of [00:19:00] people telling you about this opportunity. Real estate returns aren't returning what they can. And then we're seeing 30 percent IRR for investors on business buying, and you can leverage it with government money. Like it's crazy, right? There's an amazing opportunity.

However, businesses are a very different. Investment. It's not something you do passively, so there's a lot of things that you're not necessarily being told about the opportunity, and I want to tell you what the Internet won't tell you specifically about how you're defining the businesses that you're looking for so that you can bear that in mind as you're going through your own process and make sure that you don't hit some of these common pitfalls and that you have all the information you need to decide what kind of business you should be looking for.

So the first one I want to say is seller financing is a unicorn, right? Like, it is so, so, so rare to get 100 percent seller financing. You can get some portion of it. And by seller financing for you 101 folks, that means instead of you going to the bank and [00:20:00] borrowing money, And paying interest to the bank, you ask the owner to be the bank.

So you pay them interest in installments with the amount of money that you agreed to pay for their business. So there's this real hot topic of a hundred percent seller financing where you can put zero money into the deal and get the business handed over to you for no money. And you pay them over time with interest.

So this can happen and a lot of you are probably here because you heard Renan's story and I adore Renan. He expanded my belief in what was possible. But he will tell you and everyone else will tell you that being able to 100 percent seller finance and 8 million acquisition is rare, if not impossible for most people.

So Renan and everyone else is going to manage your expectations. And what I love about Renan is he talks about all of the no's, no's, no's, no's, no's. So. If you have the financial capability to be able to [00:21:00] finance a deal, which it doesn't take much money in, or you have the experience where you can convince an investor to back you, then you don't necessarily need to go this route, and I think it can drag your search out a long time.

So I want you to get real and understand your financing options, and please, please, please stop focusing on a hundred percent seller financing. I did it myself. I wasted a lot of time doing that, and it wasn't necessary so. A deal box. Is not just industry profit location. So you'll hear a lot of people talk about this.

And I think it's a very like pragmatic, maybe like comes from, you know, larger industry, but if you, the individual are going and looking for a business, there is so many more variables that you should consider as part of this process. And that's what we're going to talk about today. But those three things are not what make up a deal box.

It's, it's some guardrails, right? It's helpful. But it's not the only thing. And there's so many more things [00:22:00] that you should consider as part of this process. So I hear a lot of people say they want seller finance, so they don't have to personally guarantee. And if the seller has a lawyer worth anything, then they're going to ask you to personally guarantee.

So even if you get seller financing, if you get the unicorn, if you, you, you are the next Renan and you get a hundred percent seller financing, you're still going to have to personally guarantee SBA also asks you to personally guarantee. So that means putting your assets, sometimes your home on the line to take out this money and run the business.

And you're also going to have to prove your experience and capability to take on that business. If you're taking out SBA money, they want to know your background. They want to know that you are a competent person to take on this business. So bearing that all in mind, right? If you are not willing to personally guarantee Alone on a business that you are going to run, then I would suggest that you go and find ways to be more confident in yourself, because if you're not [00:23:00] willing to back yourself, why should they?

The internet tells you, you can buy a business and go sit on a beach somewhere. I'm yet to see that unless you have so much experience and enough money to be able to like, get an, Operator in that can run it, right? So these folks that already have large portfolios, they know how this works. But if you are an individual that's never bought a business before and you don't have an M.

A. M. A. experience and you've never been a business owner, it is not a passive investment. A business is a living, breathing entity that needs your involvement. And the other thing the Internet doesn't tell you is that almost always in year one, your revenue is going to drop. Right. You might lose key employees.

You might have customers that don't want a new owner. You are learning how to be the new owner of that business. So you want to be involved, especially when you've put a personal guarantee on a multi million dollar business, [00:24:00] you want to be there. So you People that are talking about keeping their W two's and buying a business.

It concerns me greatly. What if your operator starts embezzling? What if your operator isn't good and you're the one on the hook for the debt and you weren't there getting the handover from? So all of a sudden you've got to jump into a business you don't know how to run. I, I, I've coined this that laundromats are the gateway drug to business buying.

We've all started looking at them. They sound like a great opportunity. There's a lot of reasons why they're not necessarily which I'll talk about a little bit later. But a lot of us get into this because we heard laundromats were really good, right? But don't buy the industry hype. So people are looking at.

You know, home services, businesses or laundromats or car washes because they heard it's a good business to buy. But if you're not passionate about some aspect of that, you don't want to be looking at that. Like every industry can have profitable [00:25:00] businesses. So it's about looking at businesses that are the right fit for you, not the ones that are hyped by the internet.

And, and, and actually the ones that are hyped. By the internet have insane valuation prices compared to those that haven't necessarily gotten The hype so you're paying a lot more for something like car washes and Laundry mats have very limited availability to scale and you're putting yourself in a more competitive situation there, too.

So, I get this question a lot. What industries have the best margins? Don't, like, yes, okay, we can look generally and be like, okay, what industries are good margins? But the owner can run a business badly. So, even in a high industry, Or a high margin industry, if the owner doesn't know how to manage their cash flow, it can be a bad buy.

So this isn't necessarily a question you need to be asking yourself when you go through this process. My controversial take is that smaller [00:26:00] businesses equal more risk. So. When you are looking at a business that only has a couple hundred thousand in cash flow, and the owner is taking that, and the owner is actively working in the business, you're looking at buying a job that usually depends on the owner and the owner relationships, and they have all of that, like, tribal knowledge of understanding how their business works because they built it, so if you want to eventually be in a situation where you could hire an operator, or that you don't have a single point of failure.

You, the larger businesses typically have systems in place that are less risky. So even though you might see a smaller price tag and think that's less risky as an investment, those smaller businesses means that the owner hasn't figured out how to manage themselves outta the business or not be involved in the day-to-day.

So who are you to think that you can, right? Unless you have direct industry experience. So everything comes with like a caveat. By the way, so it's not a sweeping statement. It is a [00:27:00] generalization. A lot of people want remote businesses, and a lot of people want businesses that have passive owners.

But what you got to understand about that is everybody wants those kinds of businesses, and they are competitive AF, right? And rare. If you're only looking at those types of businesses, you're always going to be in a competitive situation and your search might take longer. So there's, there's an active community on SMB, Twitter, a lot of folks talking about buying businesses.

There's really great information there and great people in this community. And Ben couldn't have put it better myself. So everybody's kind of obsessed with like starting a hold co and buying multiple companies because it's like, you know, the cool kids are doing it. And he's like, I've never understood people's fascination with trying to create holding companies.

Congratulations, you've saved some overhead money. You also have a bunch of mediocre businesses that are okay at a bunch of stuff and great at nothing because your focus is all over the place. [00:28:00] Scattered focus, scattered results, right? Why not buy one business? That gets you the return that you want. Build that and be really great at that.

What is the obsession with buying multiple ones? I think, and I suspect, is that people feel less confident about going after a bigger deal. And somehow it feels like it's de risking yourself to buy a bunch of little ones. But, you know, I think find one that will do everything that you want. And there's going to be words on it, right?

But are you the person to take on those challenges? The other thing that we see a lot is your geographical constraints will slow you down. And this is this is a constant dance that we have with our clients. So if you have a very small geographical area that you are willing to look at businesses in, you're just looking at a very long timeline.

So if you feel like you're not getting enough deal flow and. If you want to talk about how to get deal flow we've got a ton of resources on the website. We're going to [00:29:00] send a link after this of workshops that I've run to increase your deal flow to be able to like look at insane amounts of deals because it's a numbers game.

So the, the, the numbers that you're getting into that funnel are going to be a lot smaller if you're very constrained to geography. And for my Austin folks, This is a hot market. There are more searchers here than I think anywhere else in the world. And there's way more searchers and businesses available.

So it's driving the price up. It's driving the competition up. We will only take on one Austin client at a time. For that reason, right? Like, it's just too hot here. So consider expanding your geographical can or location. And then the other thing that the Internet doesn't tell you is that this process takes long time, right?

So unassisted, you're looking at, you know, average of 2 years to be able to buy a business. Bear in mind, like there's search funds out there where people went and did [00:30:00] business programs and then raise money from investors to pay their salary full time to search for two whole years. Like that's how much they time they think it's going to take with a full team and everything behind them.

So if you're doing this for a couple hours a week, it's just going to take you a really long time if you're doing it by yourself, especially if you're not creating consistency and you have to learn like. Well, how do I get the information from the brokers and how do I speak to owners? And how do I teach owners how to do all this?

So you're learning how to do this before you can actually make moves on it. And then after LOI, LOI sounds, stands for letter of intent. And it's what we send when we find a business that we like, that is a commitment to buy pending. A bunch of things being in place, right? So it gets it under exclusivity.

So you're no longer in a comp competitive situation. And then you go through your due diligence, you get your financing, but after you get it under offer, it can take three to six months to close. So if you're like, I'm going to buy a business by the end of the year, well, that means you need to buy you.

You've need to identify the business and put it [00:31:00] under offer already or very quickly. Right? So the other thing is that your deal box is a process. It takes time. It takes time and it takes getting your reps in. So the only way that you're going to refine your deal box is by getting under the hood and actually speaking to owners and looking at businesses and doing those activities.

So theoretically you can come up with a deal box, but where it actually starts being refined and making sense is by having conversations. So our customer deal box journey is we do a one month onboarding process. They get on the phone with me and my team. We spend four to five hours just on the phone with them grilling them on absolutely everything we can to get an outline of what a deal box might be.

We present that with them. We're doing a bunch of other stuff, getting them ready. We're having them fill out checklists so that we're learning the parameters. That does not set [00:32:00] it in stone because there's a lot of maybes that come up when you're going through this process, you're like, I don't know how I feel about that.

And the only way to find out if it's a yes or a no is, is to get under the hood. So typically on market is where you're going to get volume, where you're going to be able to get those reps in almost immediately. So my folks out there that want to just go off market, you're just going to get less at bats.

I can't believe I keep using these sports analogies. I literally have never played sports in my life. I did it last night. You can tell how, Well, hopefully I'll use them right. But if you want to get your reps in and define that deal box quicker than looking where the businesses are already for sale is going to be the best place of doing that.

So we have a calibration period. It usually takes one to two months where we're putting opportunities in front of clients and stress testing those, those maybe areas. Right. And it helps us get into their head even more when we're looking at businesses on their behalf, but it helps them sharpen up what is a [00:33:00] maybe into a yes or a no.

So that when we do present them with the opportunity, they feel even more confident to move forward. Then off market, if you're speaking to business owners directly, they're not necessarily in the selling state. So these conversations can take a lot longer and you're going to have to teach them the process.

Of how this works, right? If they're not represented by somebody, so if you've gotten your reps in early on, you're going to be a lot more confident when you speak to those owners and when you get those conversations started. So we know it takes 2 to 3 months at a minimum to get these owners to give us their financials to get their ad backs to get a determination of to get an understanding of what their valuation expectations are to really stress test that they are ready to sell.

Before we can hand it over to our clients, which is great because our clients have had a bunch of at bats already before they get to that point. So then they feel a lot more confident and then the owner feels confident dealing with that. So if you're brand new to this and you're going straight to owners, they're going to get a sense of that and not feel [00:34:00] comfortable moving forward.

So let me just check where we are in time. Okay, great. Sip of coffee real quick. Forgive me. I'm going to briefly cover my journey. I'm not going to go into a ton of detail because I just checked the time. Maybe I'll do a session on this at some point, cause it is, it is wild. I told you a little preview of it, but I just want you to see how I kind of sharpened up my processes.

I was going through this as an individual searcher before I started this business. And then we're going to talk about how you can go through your own process after that. So like you, I started looking at laundromats and. My, my laundry like broke here so I actually had to go into a laundromat and I, I didn't want to, those of you that are in Austin, you know, the, the, you know, laundromat on, on South Congress, the, the police are there all the time.

It's, it's, it's a little terrifying to [00:35:00] go in. So I didn't even want to go into a laundromat and I was like, how am I even. Looking at buying laundromats when I don't want to go into right. And the other thing is that they're very limited in terms of available money and scale. So it's unlikely you're going to be able to get an operator.

And so you're going to be running that yourself, or you're having to buy multiple ones in order to have an operator that can sit across multiple. And I just realized it wasn't really a good application of my skill set, right? Like, I wasn't hyped up about growing that business. And I, business is one of my love languages.

Like, all day long, I will talk business, but I just wasn't getting hyped about the improvements or things that I could do to a laundromat. So then I started looking at printing and mailbox. And this was my first opportunity to get under, under the hood on a franchise also. And this poor. This poor company.

I mean, I found the number one out of like hundreds of franchisees in the network. They've been doing it for 20 years. Number one in sales. And they were only taking [00:36:00] home 100, 000 a year. So I was like, Oh my God, I'd be like buying a job. It's a dying industry. And there was a limit to the growth because you know, the footprint could only handle so much equipment and so many mailboxes.

And you're paying somebody else to tell you what to do. And they were taking advantage of him, too, because he was so good. They were like, okay, getting free consultancy off of him so they could make more money off their other franchisees. So, again, I don't like being told what to do. So franchises are not something that I would personally consider.

Then I was, you know, working with one of my favorite clients. I'm going to show you, you know, like cover their, they got me this, this trophy. I was doing business consulting, right? And this is the best damn business consultant on the planet. So I keep this on my desk because on low moments, I always look at this and I smile and I adored them.

I loved working with them. Believed in their business wholeheartedly, and we started talking about me doing consultancy for equity. So here that kind of synonymous with the buying business world. They were [00:37:00] only doing 300 in revenue. We were on track to get them to 500, but I was looking at what I would need to do in order to improve that business.

And what I would want to make in order to do that. And there just wasn't enough there. So my value of time was much higher than getting into this. And I was like, I would be able to put my time into a business that I could buy and get a much better return. So we happily parted ways. They're doing great.

And it's also where I learned about the not learned, but you know, where you can stress test profit share versus revenue share. I then looked at car washes. I found an off market car wash and, Oh my god, there's so many hilarious stories about this guy. But it was my first understanding deeply of commercial real estate.

I've never been interested in real estate. You know, businesses are my thing. But when you're looking at car washes, there is a real estate component. So I got deep on real estate. And I just couldn't make it make sense y'all. I was like, I'm literally like not going to ever make money off this business.

There's no cash flow to it [00:38:00] unless I sold it at some point. I'm like, I want cash flow now. And there's a limit to growth with car washes. I got really good at negotiation because this guy wanted like, Six X and I went in and offered him 1. 5 and I was dying, but never split. The difference was reading that book during this and it just gave me some reps and negotiations.

And also having that conversation with myself of like, what number will feel good to me to invest my time. I told you about the property management deal. That was an 8 million purchase price. It was in Dallas. I was not looking in Dallas. I wasn't looking at property management, but when I looked at the business, the owners, the values, my skillset, and what I could do for that business, like I was like, This, this is the one.

I was the only buyer out of 14 that was allowed to meet the owners. It was a great relationship and I lost because I didn't know enough about structuring. I didn't have my financial acumen primed by the [00:39:00] time I got that. So I lost the opportunity because I wasn't good enough. At investment at M and a in this small business space, but I would have been the perfect person to take on that business and be the business owner, which is why I started the business that I do now and why I spend this time with you all, whether you work with us or not, I want you to have information and resources to level the playing field so individuals can buy small businesses and we keep these small businesses in the hands of individuals rather than P.

E. Buying them, tearing them up, destroying them for, you know, a higher multiple. So this is where I really deeply got into SBA and structuring. And it was also my first broker deal that I, I worked on and I love the broker. He was great. He worked really hard. We had a lot of long conversations. So I got over my brokers are bad.

Like there's a lot of really great brokers out there. So if you're not looking at broker deals, because you think brokers are. You're just missing out on really great opportunities and a couple of our clients are under offer on broker deals and also off market deals. So [00:40:00] you can find them both. And then I looked at a 3.

2 million EBITDA event equipment, rental business, and that was where I really got a crash course in CapEx and financial statements. I'm not going to get too much into that now, but, oh, my God, it was. I had the right skills to do that business, but it was the wrong environment for me. I was just like looking at a 17 million dollar garage sale and cleaning up all these processes.

And I was the uniquely skilled person to do that. And I would have had to relocate to Harland in Texas. I'm vegan, like I could only eat at the Taco Bell down there and none of my friends are down there, none of the things that I like, and I was like, if this business was in Austin, yeah, I'd have a run at it because I, I could absolutely do it.

So that's where I realized it's the right skills, but not, it was the wrong environment for me. So let's talk about your deal box refining journey. So where are you okay living? And you can have some fun with this, right? Like, okay, you're living here [00:41:00] now, but where would you like to live? You know, if the right business came up in a place that you've always thought about living, Like, you know, when that business came up in Dallas, I was like, I'll live in Dallas.

I don't care. Like this business is, is the one and I'll be able to like open up locations in other places. So the geography ends up being something that holds most of you back. And it's the thing we talk about the most with clients about expanding. So you can have fun, like where would be an amazing place to live and look in those places for businesses also.

Your don't want what you don't want in a business or qualities. There are more important than what you do want, because at least it's a hard line, right? And you can say like, Nope, that's a deal breaker. I don't want that. You want to think about what are you good at? What are the skill sets that you've amassed over time?

And how could you apply that to businesses? So then let's say you don't have. You're looking at an HVAC business. You don't have HVAC experience, but the owner was, you know, the top salesman and you have strong sales experience. Well, then you can fill those shoes and [00:42:00] take it to that next level. Or maybe it needs strong sales experience and didn't have that.

And you're able to go in and do that. You want to look about what excites you, both from industries and also, you know, things that you enjoy doing, what types of tasks you enjoy doing, or what are your hobbies, what are your strange things that you're interested in, and how can you look at businesses from that lens of, I really like working on these kinds of projects, or I like these types of things, You want to have a conversation with yourself about franchises, regulations and licensing, right?

Franchises are somebody else telling you what to do and you're paying them money for it, but it is a set system. Regulations are how do you feel about having to deal with government regulations if you go into a business that has like environmental, reporting requirements, for example. And then a lot of businesses require licenses.

So if you don't have that license, like plumbing or HVAC, you're going to have to give someone equity, most likely to be able to [00:43:00] own that business. Or now you have a single point of failure, right? Like if somebody else holds the license and you don't get along, your business shuts down. So Getting your comfort level with that and then looking at customer base too.

So, you know, where do you want your customers to be? What kind of customers do you want? Do you want enterprise customers, business customers, you know, consumers, how do you feel about that? And then you want to look at your Industries like look at all the industries you possibly can and you can go on to a lot of the business buying sites and just like get their lists and go through and say like, yes, no, yes, no.

And like I said, those are more important. The maybes are ones that you can start stress testing and looking into, but I encourage you if you're not sure you don't have like a specific industry that like that is absolutely what I want to do. You allow yourself to be open to the possibilities. Your deal box should also take into consideration things like your long term goals.

So do you see yourself being the owner of this business and holding on to this business for a long [00:44:00] time? Are you wanting to, you know, sell it in a couple of years? What do you want your family and your personal life to be looking like and how does this business fit into that? You also want to look at your personal skill set and your zone of genius.

What work environments do you like working in your hobbies and interests? And then have a real good audit and look at yourself in terms of your leadership experience, right? Because you buy a business. Regardless of whether there's an operator there or not, you're going to have to get really good at managing people.

And what's your business acumen? Have you ever run a business before? How much do you understand about business? If you're lacking in these areas, then you find ways to upskill and get experience while you're doing this process, because tell you what you take on that business. And you haven't thought about any of this once you take it on, it's not going to look good.

Also on this, when you're considering these things, you can look at businesses that kind of match your experience level and your skill level when you're talking to the [00:45:00] owners. So I want you to consider it. So SDE is seller discretionary earnings for you. One on one folks. It's how much the owner takes out of the business.

So it's the marker of what we end up looking at. Like what could you potentially take home as the new business owner? So you want to look at that number, but you want to look at how much you want to make after you've calculated the debt that you will have to pay. So debt service coverage ratio is something that the banks look at.

Like, is there enough money in the business after you've paid yourself, after you've paid all the expenses, after you've paid the debt to. Weather variability, which there will be. So what most people do is they, they look at, they're like, I'm going to make 200, 000 after debt service. And then they look at businesses that are 200, 000 and after you've paid all the expenses and project costs and debt, you're looking at like 80, 000 take home, right?

So you want to make sure that your financial parameters make sense [00:46:00] for what you're trying to achieve and how you're going to the numbers work and how to get these deals financed. So I highly recommend if you haven't and you're an individual buyer, you get SBA pre qualified because that's going to tell you with your own financial situation, how much are they willing to lend you?

Right? And then you can problem solve around that if it's lower than what you were thinking, or it might be bigger than you were thinking. So it just gives you some runway there. And again, looking at SCE after debt service. So I cannot stress this enough. And you've heard my story. Learn financing options and structures like how to structure an offer to an owner.

You don't just offer money, right? That money comes with a bunch of terms. How are you paying it? Who's getting paid? What's the interest rate? What's being treated as equity? Right? Like our investors coming in and giving you some money and it's not treated as a loan. Learning all of that stuff and all that terminology because it's going to come up.

And that's, that could be the thing that [00:47:00] holds you back from being able to make a competitive offer. Or it could be the thing that costs you a lot down the line because you put yourself into a deal that is not a winner for you once you take it over. Okay. We're almost there. Whew. So avoiding the pitfalls declining industries.

So when you're looking at industries, you want to look at not only the business itself, but what's the industry doing as a whole. So printing as an example is an industry that's just, it's trending down. So if you buy in a, in an industry that's trending down and you don't have. That background or that direct industry experience, you're buying a business.

It's just going to be in a decline over time. Right? So you want to look at ones that are either flat or growing like stable or growing unless you have direct industry experience and, you know, Where the, the, the opportunities are. There's a really great podcast [00:48:00] on acquiring minds, where they talk about buying up auto repair shops.

There's some really cool tactics in there about how to utilize SBA loans in different ways for real estate and that sort of thing. But they talk about their approach to a declining industry. So if you have a really smart strategy for how you're going to weather that otherwise, you know, if you just want to be safe, don't buy in a declining industry.

You want to check if there is a limitation to the growth opportunity. So with a car wash, for example, there's only so many cars you can get through in a day. So you're going to be limited by the amount of revenue that you can take in. I mean, yes, you can raise prices, but in my car wash situation, he'd already raised prices and the location couldn't accommodate any more washes or anything.

So it was like literally a limitation on the growth opportunity. Laundry mats are the same thing. So those of you that know me know that I love like relationships and dating and business buying are so [00:49:00] similar Which is probably why it was not probably it's why I call it matchmaking, right? So when you're dating and you're unsuccessful or you don't have time you're like, okay, I'm gonna go to a professional They're going to get my likes, they're going to go out and look for me, and then they're going to present me options.

And as a matchmaker, I'm going to be like, I know you said you wanted this, but in my professional opinion, I think you should consider this. Why don't you go on a date? So that's what we do with business buying. But we are really good at, when we meet someone, Falling in love with the potential, right?

Like, Oh, it could be this and it could be that. People do the same thing with businesses. So when you're looking at a business opportunity, you want to be in love with how it is performed. And if nothing changed for with this business, would you be happy with it? Right? Not all your, I could do this and I could do this and I could do that.

And it's a way that we talk ourselves into a business. It's not a good fit or not a good business. So make sure you're not falling in love with potential. And often, I mean, I certainly had this [00:50:00] pattern in my life. The thing you saw at the beginning that you knew in your gut was going to be a problem is the thing that ends up being the same problem at the end.

And I'm speaking of relationships, but it's the same thing with businesses, right? So no business is going to be perfect. They're going to be warts, but you want to make sure that you're not covering up those warts with lipstick. And so with the operator thing, you know, people are like, I'm going to stay in my W2, I'm going to hire an operator.

Make sure you're at least taking time off and you're there through the transition. And, you know, that's your personal guarantee. So I don't think it's really realistic under exceptional circumstances, or you have a partner. That you trust, but even partnerships, I could do a whole session just on that.

And it's really important to be honest with what your weaknesses are. What are you not good at? And making sure you do an audit of that, not necessarily to demotivate yourself, but to know where your blind spots are and don't buy businesses that are literally enhancing your weaknesses. So make sure you're getting your [00:51:00] reps in tell everyone you're buying literally every conversation you have, say, I'm looking for businesses to buy, you'll never, it's, it's incredible what comes up, go and visit businesses that you're interested in, speak to as many owners as you possibly can, ideally those that are selling, right?

So you can just get your reps in and having those conversations and exploring their business and learning the things about them. And if you're interested in an industry. Go do a ride along, find someone that you can spend a day in the life of, or if you're speaking to an owner of a business that you want to buy, spend the day with them, go see that business.

I can't tell you the number of people that like, don't go visit in my whole journey. Literally the first second that I could, I was like in that business meeting that owner face to face. I want to see what it's like. I want to see how it feels. So don't let that leave a lot of time, either go and look at it.

For industries that you're just interested in, or as soon as you get in a conversation, as soon as you can go and meet them. And then if you're interested in specific industries, but not sure about it, or you're under offer [00:52:00] on an industry, ask non competitive owners for advice or ask them if you can interview them, right?

Like, how can you get the full picture and experience to know whether it's a good business for you? So finally, you know, your your gut tells you a lot, right? Like we get X about business to what you might not be able to discern without doing this for a while is what's an ick that's legitimate and what's an ick that's a self sabotage and holding you back from achieving your goal, which is why it's good to have accountability partners or hire people that can do that for you.

So. When you have a gut check, you want to see and like, close your eyes and visualize, like, can I see myself in this business? Right. And how does that make me feel when I'm picturing myself as the owner of this business? Am I proud of it? Am I proud that I'm going to go tell people that I'm the owner of the laundry mat on South Congress, or does it get me excited?

Will it get me out of bed every day? Cause I cannot. Emphasize this enough. It doesn't matter how well the business is run. [00:53:00] There's still going to be problems and you're going to need to be the one to solve them because you're not working in corporate anymore with a board that tells you what to do and tells you, no, it's on you.

Every decision is on you as the business owner. Okay. So there's two resources that I think are really good for helping you sharpen up your, your deal box. If you're not working with us, one is a quick one. It's acquiring minds podcast, Sam Rosati, who's a amazing person in this community. That's given a ton.

He has events, he has a law firm and runs a business accelerator as well. So he talks about how to shorten your search, big three, little two. I think it's a little light, but it'll get you started. And then by then build, if you haven't read that, it's a really good deep dive into how to do this and how to apply your skillsets to your deal box.

So a friend said this to me early on, and I have it written on a post it note. Behind my computer. And the closer you are, the harder it gets. Like this is hard. This is a hard process. [00:54:00] It's hard. You know, the search is one of the hardest parts. The acquisition process is really hard. And then it's going to continue to be hard after you buy the business.

But honestly, like if you push through the hard, then that's where the winning happens. And you are only one deal away from changing your life. Right. You find one business matches your criteria that you are capable of taking over. You're excited about and you can get finance. That business can change your whole life.

You're only 1 deal away from that. So. I imagine some of you are going to have some questions. I've got a few things I'm going to cover before we get to the Q& A, but start dropping your questions now. Ryan's keeping track of those and we're going to go through them in a moment. So I know I dropped a lot on you.

We're going to send the replay out tomorrow in an email. All of you are registered. We love your feedback on these sessions. So things you didn't understand, things you think we could improve, or if you just want to say you really enjoyed it. I obviously love hearing that also. [00:55:00] And even better if what we shared with you made a difference in your business buying journey.

So please share your stories with us. Our next session we're going to announce soon. We've been doing these every two weeks, but I have some timing conflicts. So we'll talk Let you all know we have your email on when the next one is. We've got three or four previous workshops up on our website. So if you like today, go and check out the other ones.

It's going to talk to you about the toolkits available in your deal sourcing journey. And which one you should choose there's a bunch of templates in terms of how to process and review your pipeline. And there's a deal calculator, which we're going to share with you today. I didn't go through it.

But it's really quick. You can input some numbers and you can see what that debt service coverage ratio is. And then we're planning that one on one session. So we're going to do that soon. If you're interested in working with us and what I just went through, you're like, oh, my God, I don't want to do that on my own, or I don't have the time.

I don't have the time to do this, but I would make an amazing business owner [00:56:00] and I see the value in the who, not how. And I want to hire someone to do it. You can fill out the form. Anca is going to share the link. Because of Renan's lovely mention in Acquiring Minds, we are pretty inundated right now.

So we do have a pretty extensive wait list and we only take on a few clients every quarter to make sure that we're delivering really good value. So just bear with us, we'll get back to you. And that link will be in the replay too. And you can also scan this QR code now that's going to have the replay link.

It's going to have some links to the books and resources that I mentioned. It has a link to our past workshops and also the link to the forum. So you can just, Scan that and grab it all in one place. So, thank you. That was, that was a big one. That was a big sesh right on the hour. So I am more than happy to stay and answer all of your questions.

We'll keep the recording on, so that will be in the replay too. But that is all I wanted to share [00:57:00] in terms of the slides today. Oh, there you go. You get to see some of my, my music life, my background. So cool. All right, Ryan, do we have any questions? We do. We have some questions. Guys, we have time for more questions as well.

So if you've already asked a question, go ahead and feel free to drop another one. We will, we'll get to it. But let's start with the 1st, when we have a question from Nate. Nate asked at the beginning of the, webinar you were talking about the SBA. He asked, where were you listening to the SBA lender market discussion?

Yeah, so I will always plug Acquiring Minds. It's a podcast that is run by Will Smith. I think he is one of the most important voices we have in this community right now because he interviews people that have gone through the search process. And talks about the reality of it. What, what happened during your search?

What happened after you took it over the [00:58:00] good and the bad, right? Like he's excavating those stories off of searchers. And he's also been running a bunch of really amazing free webinars. So it was a webinar that he was running right before us today with SBA lenders. So if you go to acquiringminds. co, I think we've shared the link in, The resources page.

It's down at the bottom. Whenever he puts the replay back up for that one, it'll be there. But I think it's really beneficial for everybody to listen to. So you can start wrapping your head around structuring and also how SBA views these kinds of deals when you come to them and what you should do before you even get to them, right?

To have success. So that's a great question. Okay. Next question we have from Brad Brad's asking, is part of the vetting work, part of the vetting working the seller through SDA, SDE, or asking price? Sorry, so I think he's referring to off market here. Is [00:59:00] part of the vetting working the seller through SDE or asking price?

Yeah, I see Brad nodding his head, so yeah! You know, when I Started my own search and I was working with owners. I was like, Oh my God, there's a lot of education that we need to do. Right? Like they don't know anything about this and well, Hey, I'm an educator. I'm a lecturer at one of the top business schools in the country.

And as you can tell from today, I love teaching, right? I love helping people to learn and my personal. Why one of my personal why's is my parents were lifelong entrepreneurs. And when they wanted to retire, they just shut their business down. And then my dad had a heart attack last year and a triple bypass and.

He's, he's better for it which is, you know, great. But the nest egg is not so cushy anymore and knowing what I do now, I could have helped them sell their business and have a much cushier nest egg. So one of our company values, which you can see on our team page is leave them better than you found them.[01:00:00] 

And part of that is helping the owner understand. Their value drivers, making them feel comfortable about the process. What's about to happen? We introduce, you know, the owners to attorneys and folks to help them because it's better for them to have experienced, good, small business attorneys as a buyer also.

And then we end up having really great results. When we introduce the owners to our, our buyers, to our clients, because they feel really comfortable and they're really excited. And then we only work with clients that have the same values that we do. So the reason why we're able to be competitive with the off market opportunities is because we, we tell them, we're like, we only represent individuals.

They're not private equity and they're not going to tear up your business. They want to be stewards of your business and take it on. And so it ends up being a really good value match. And as part of that process, in order to make sure that we're not wasting your time as a client, we're making sure that they understand enough and are ready to sell so that it's [01:01:00] not wasting your time and that their valuation expectations are within reality.

So we won't give them an exact price. Right. And we work with them to get the ad backs. Ryan spends a lot of time teaching them like what that is and how to do it. And so we know the SDE, we know that what they want for the business. So we ask them like, what do you want, you know, and if it's like 10 X and it's like, okay, well, here's what actually drives.

Valuations, right? And we give them a range. So we, we don't set an actual price because that's for our clients to determine what they want to pay and how they want to do that. So the long winded answer, but that was a very good question. And I think it's important because there are. A lot of search services out there.

And if you are good at this, if you are good at like educating owners and you have M& A experience and stuff like that, we're not the, we're not the people for you. We're, we're the ones that help like first time buyers that don't necessarily know how this process works and want, want some [01:02:00] help both on their side and also to tee up the owner so that it's a productive conversation off market when you don't have an intermediary in the middle of it, but there are other sourcing.

Companies out there that they literally just hunt and pass you opportunities, and they do none of the consultancy, none of the handholding. They don't work with the owner at all. They're just like, what are you making? What's your profit? Are you willing to sell? Here you go. You know, and it's over to you to figure out the rest.

So great question. Okay, you are we have a question from Matt. Athena, you were referring, you were talking about holding companies earlier. He says, from my experience, building a holding company may be part of the growth strategy. For example, if one is doing a roll up with acquisitions, a holding company enables that to occur.

In this example is that there is common market focus and function of the holding company. Curious about your thoughts. Yeah. [01:03:00] Well, Matt, I don't know your background, so if you have experience doing roll ups and these kinds of things, then it might be the right play for you. The, you know, I'm speaking to the individual that probably doesn't have M and a experience or maybe has never been a business owner.

Or know how to navigate that roll up in that transition period. So in my experience, looking under the hood of thousands of businesses, one is enough, right? Like you've got enough problems and things to sort out with one. So if you have multiple going on, and I saw this with the founders that I worked with a lot as well, they would start multiple businesses at once and scattered focus gets scattered results.

So. If you have experience and you're like, I know what to do and how to roll them up and how to combine them all or whatever, then that might be the play for you. But for the average individual, that's like, I'm in the golden handcuffs in my W2. I want to be a business owner and I want to stop answering to the board or all these people.

One is more than enough for you to, you know, do [01:04:00] really well, as long as you buy the right business, it's the right skill set for you and that you can grow and scale. Then after you have experience doing that, and I'm talking a couple years, then it might make sense for you to start buying additional ones.

But you're setting yourself up for disaster if you don't have any experience with any of that, and you try to buy a bunch all at once. Because, you know, this is, this is a people game, right? Managing people and relationships and that sort of thing. Yeah. The play with roll ups and private equity is typically to, to make as many cost savings as possible so they can sell it again to somebody else.

So if you're looking at a buy and hold situation and you want to get that dream of being a passive owner and get an operator in place and you can go off on the beach and have somebody else run in your business, you're more likely to get that focusing on one. That's my opinion. Like, and like I said, These are generalizations are not sweeping statements.

So there's going to be exceptions to every single rule. And those of you that are here from hearing or non story, you know, there's a real, [01:05:00] we have a real example of of an exception where he was able to get 100 percent seller financing, 8 million deal, you know, and what he's been doing after is insane, too.

So there's always going to be exceptions. And it's. It's why this process is so personal to you and I blitz through it in an hour, but it's why we spend a month with clients is because it's a very personal excavation of like, what's going to be the right fit for you? Because this is something you're going to be doing for the next 5, 10 years.

These SBA loans are for 10 years, right? So it's a great question. Next question we have is from Dwye. He asks, do you invest directly? What a great question. So yeah, I've I've got some conversations myself happening for acquisitions that makes sense for us in our business. So this is where, you know, roll up or a little talk under makes sense where, you know, it's it's services that my clients are using.

So it's a [01:06:00] long game for me, like dating before we get married and that sort of thing. So I'm looking at acquisitions myself in terms of us investing into other people's deals. We're not there yet, but it is, you know, because we're seeing these deals intimately, we consider like, Hey, you know, do we want to present?

Being involved in this or is there some value add that we could potentially offer also? So it's not off the table. It's just not an active focus for us right now. Great question. Gabriel asks, how do I find private investors and initiate conversations with investors? What are the ways that investors might be thinking about deals?

Yeah. So acquiring, I'm going to, I'm going to plug the acquiring lines again. There are webinars. Sam Rosati did two webinars in particular on raising investment for these types of deals and how to structure them because this is the most unique structuring I've ever seen as far as investors are concerned and what's awesome [01:07:00] coming from startup world, right?

I was always telling startups like, do not take investors like, Never. You know, it's very, very rare that you should take an investor as a startup because you're basically bringing in a boss who's going to be trying to like milk you to get as much money out of you as possible because their investors are riding their butt ass.

Sorry. I cuss. And, It's not a good play for most startups, right? And you end up giving away so much because how they value your future made up numbers might be different than how you're valuing your future made up numbers, but with getting investors onto a already performing business, you're looking at past performance, and then you're able to get a valuation.

That's, I think, a lot more reasonable. And your economics are so much better because it's past performance, right? So the risk is much less because it's a business that's already been performing. So Sam Rosati and [01:08:00] we'll do on the webinars tab, there's two on how you can structure it with investors. And then Sam has also been creating an investor list.

Of individuals that want to invest into these types of deals because they like the fact that you're putting a personal guarantee. You know, they're assuming that you're going to do SBA and that you're putting a personal guarantee on it and that their money is leveraged and, you know, ideally, you want to go to investors that.

You would have had to pay a lot of money for, for their experience and advice, right? And now they're invested in you. So when things go wrong, you can call them up. So my whole world kind of changed around investment for this, because I got very excited about it because I'm like, I will still have governance.

I will still have control of the business. I might give up some equity for that, but I get to bring people in that have experience. That's going to support me through this process. And I'm not giving up the control or the potential governance. And I'm not having people that are like driving me to, to sell or, you know, Perform in a certain way.

It's very different because it's [01:09:00] cash flowing. So they just get their nice returns that way. The other thing I will say that when I found myself on Friday afternoon before Labor Day weekend being told by the broker he was giving me until Wednesday to come up with 3 million to show him I can finance the deal, I was like, okay, I, you know, Eff it.

I'm going to go for it. But that point that I put in the deal box of like, talk to absolutely everyone about buying a business. I was, I was obsessed. It's the only thing I wanted to talk about still to this day. So when people expressed interest in investing in this type of opportunity, when I told them the kind of returns that they could make.

I just made a list, you know, I keep a spreadsheet on my computer of anyone that's ever expressed interest in it. And then when I was looking at like a holiday weekend, I'm like, okay, well, who on this list knows me well enough that I feel comfortable enough going and having a conversation with on, you know, asking them to [01:10:00] have a conversation with me on a Saturday or Sunday or Monday of a holiday weekend.

But yeah, like every opportunity you can to talk to people. And then if somebody, like I said, if all of that scared you and you're like, no way, I don't want to do any of that. Like being a business owner is it's a lot of work, right? But you can still invest into somebody that's willing to put in that work and get really great returns.

So when you're having the conversations with people, like getting a gauge of like, if you know that they have money, but they probably aren't going to be an operator, put them on the list. And then when you find an opportunity, this is my top tip, right? And I did this with the startups. Don't ask for money.

Ask for advice. So if you ask for money, you'll get advice. If you ask for advice, you'll get money. So with every single one of those investors on the 3 million, I said, Hey, I've got this deal. It's wild. I could really use your thoughts on it. Right? And then I told them the whole situation I was in. I'm like, here's what's going on.

Here's how the business is [01:11:00] performed. Here's what the broker just did to me on Friday. I've already got a banker lined up. What do you think? Blake, Clark, I mean, it was amazing. Every single one of them were like, what's the minimum? I'm like 250, 000. You know? So, it, it, it, When you have a good deal, right, and they know you, or they, like, this is, you know, you can show the returns and the money will come, but if you ask for the money, then they'll just give you advice on your deal.

So ask for advice and you might, you might surprise yourself with what comes out of that. That's, that's a few quick top tips on raising investment, but I could do a whole other, every topic I feel like I could do a whole webinar on because I just love this stuff and all the tactics and things that we can do.

Next question we have is from Samantha. She asks, Do you provide service for searching in Canada? That's a good question. We don't have Canada yet. I do have some folks that are [01:12:00] in Canada. And the only reason why we wouldn't do Canada is because the financing. So I'm more than happy to have a conversation about it and see.

If you felt like you could manage the financing side of things there, then it's no different for us to do the search and, and, and kind of guide you through that process because it's not going to be hugely different where it will be different is the financing. And if you're using you know, the, the.

Banks and I don't think there's an like similar SBA program. So from what I understand from the folks that I've seen in these types of deals is that the terms are a lot more aggressive. So the debt service that needs to be, you know, considered differently. And we can help with the structuring once we learn the parameters, but I'll be fully honest.

Like we don't know how the financing works in Canada. So that would be my concern, but everything else that we do in terms of the searching vetting that sort of thing. It's not much different. We have another question from Gabriel. He asks, [01:13:00] is that deal calculator and Excel document? Yeah. Yeah. So if you click into the link that we shared, there's like 3 boxes that you can change and it's basically the revenue, the SCE or profit or EBITDA, whatever they've listed and then the asking price and then it will do all the calculations for you.

Caveat, the working capital is just a generic. So that is not how you calculate working capital, but at least it puts in a buffer for it. And then your deal costs are basically an estimate there too. So you can look at without our really bad working capital or deal cost calculations and, and with, so yeah, there's a Excel or it's a Google sheet.

Oh, was he asking about Excel? You can download Google sheets as Excel. If that was the question. Okay. Yeah. So if you go into file and then download as you can download it as an Excel document, if you can't do Google sheet. [01:14:00] Okay. Next question we have is from Ralston. He asks, how do you go about valuing commercial properties during business acquisition?

Should you separate the business purchase from the real estate purchase? Absolutely. They need to stand up individually. And you can use different financing options for them and you should, right? Because with SBA, there's a cap on businesses. There's a much bigger amount that you can do on real estate.

And so you want to make sure that both of those individually stand up, right? The valuation on the real estate stands up and then the valuation on the business and the cashflow on its own stands up. But you are going to want to look at, you know, if you're, if you're paying market rent, which can hopefully be like your loan payments on the, So your business is going to have to pay bread to the real estate.

So does the debt service still work with all of those expenses? So that's, you're going to want to make sure that the expenses work, but you're going to want to value them [01:15:00] separately. And you can often take two different loans and get better, you know, terms or unlock more SBA financing. If you do end up wanting to get additional ones down the line, that's a great question.

Another question from July, they asked. How do you compare to SIG? I'm not familiar with SIG. I'm not completely familiar with them either. Yeah, not familiar with them, but we'll look into them. You know, I think there's a few random competitors popping up, but If you're looking for a white glove kind of concierge service and you don't have a lot of time and you're not really sure what you should be looking for but you're dead set on being a business owner, then we're good, we're good for that because we can kind of steward you through that process.

So I don't know if SIG does all of that. From what I've understood from all the other options out there, they don't do this deal box or [01:16:00] consulting or that sort of thing. They just search for you or you know, You have to come with a fully baked deal box in order to work with them. We have another question from Brad.

He asked, do you offer a service of taking point on deal to closing? We haven't had one that felt right for that yet. I'm not completely, close to it, but we won't take on clients right now under that model. So it's something that we could potentially discuss down the line if, if the deal makes sense for us.

And it is something that we'll probably entertain in the future as, as we get. Larger ourselves, and we're able to take more of those kinds of risks, but you want us to make sure that our team is fully paid. So we're advising you in a way that we're not, you know, wedded to, how your deal does or how your business does because we might influences it.

So even our [01:17:00] fees were flat fee. We don't do percentage of the deal. I don't understand how people do that on buy side because I want you to get the best price possible. So if I know I get more money for you buying a bigger business or offering more money, then how do you think I'm going to advise you?

So so yeah, we're not, it's a great question, Brad, and it's something I've thought about a lot. The opportunity hasn't presented itself. So at the moment it's, it's making sure that our interests are aligned with how our fees are set up, but it, you know, it could, it's not, it's not a hard no, if the right opportunity and business came up.

Next question we have is from Pender. Second. Pender asks, when it comes to your deal box, is it a bad or a good thing that I know what industries I am not interested in? Instead of knowing the exact industry, this is the hardest part for me right now. Yeah, nose or nose are important, right? Like, I didn't have a no on laundry mats, and I was looking at laundry mats, and I should have had a no.

So, [01:18:00] like, nose are great, and that's what we look for when we're analyzing businesses and analyzing opportunities, is we eliminate anything that's a no for somebody, and then we consider Anything that's not a no. And then that's where we go a little level deeper and looking at like, okay, is there a skill set match?

Is there a cultural match? Is there an environmental environment match customer match? Like all of those other things that we talked about. So starting with your nose is a really great pace to kind of like lower or, condense the amount of opportunities that you're looking at. And then, We have one more question.

So if anybody has any other questions, drop them now. We have some more time. So feel free to ask another question. But last question we have is from Matthew. He asked to what level do y'all support due diligence? If at all? Yeah, it's a great question. Matthew. It's something we're constantly looking at.

Like, how do we get better at? Because we are technically a search and match. Company, and then [01:19:00] once you get it under offer, we're there is a consultant and an advisor to you. So we're different in a, in, like, from a business broker, because a business broker is going to be negotiating the deal for you and kind of running that process for you in our scenario.

Once you've got it under offer, we're behind the scenes kind of advising and consulting you, but you're running the show on, you know. Keeping things going with the seller and collecting the due diligence that you need from them and running your deal team. But we introduce you to people that are really great as far as lawyers insurance due diligence, financial due diligence.

So between your advisory team, between your deal team, you'll be well consulted. If there's a broker on the other side, you know, that's not a problem. particularly helpful with the seller. We introduce you to lenders that know us and love our clients because they know that we help them with the structuring in a way that's going to make sense.

And we vet all of our clients too. So we only take on people that we know would be great business owners. So [01:20:00] we're consulting you through that. And what typically happens is when someone goes under offer, they'll schedule a weekly meeting. With us where we can just check in and see what what questions they have what came up what they need Do they need any introductions or did the sellers say this?

So we can kind of help hold your hand through the process Because your success is our success So, you know the difference is we're just not going to be doing the negotiating and the project management on your behalf But anka built this like incredible So we have all these resources that we give you to like how to financially model with investors and SBA and calculate your debt service coverage ratio.

It's not the template that I shared with you today. That's, that's a very simple one. So if you watched Renan's podcast, the dumb calculator, this is actually a very souped up evolution of his dumb calculator. But we have these like Financial structuring templates that we give clients that the banks love.

And then Anca created this like due diligence tracker. You're going to be collecting like hundreds of pieces of diligence [01:21:00] from the buyer. And we've created this like system for you to keep track of it, name it, see what the status is on everything. And everyone that's used it is like, you've got to charge for this.

And we're like, no, our clients just get it. So, Yeah, that's I answered the question. I got off track a little bit there, but that's how we support through diligence. I'm constantly thinking about this. The team's constantly thinking about this. Like what can we do to tee you up for success? But you know, one of the cool things is that you're able to use your, your fees paid to us towards your down payment equity injection requirements on SBA.

And in order to do that, we have to not be Advising on certain aspects of it. So it's better this way because you can include us in your overall loan costs. And then what you've paid to us gets treated as part of your equity injection.

Okay. We have a couple additional [01:22:00] questions. Do I ask, can we get a ballpark caught on cost of working with your team? A lot of positives in today's conversation. So it's a great question. I don't share it publicly because I need to understand your situation and make sure you're good fit. And there's a whole kind of manner of services that we offer that I need to take you through what I can say is it's going to be more than you're expecting, but it is going to shorten your timeline considerably.

Right? Most of our clients go under offer in 4 to 6 months. And we're able to help them in a way that gets a good deal and gets it financed. So, there's some upfront costs, but you can lump it into the SBA financing. And it makes sense. So we look at folks that have at least 300. Thousand to invest, right?

So it's like assets available. And that's where I think it makes sense to work with somebody like us when you're looking at deals of that size. [01:23:00] So the 300 doesn't go to us. It's just like you have 300 available to deploy in a deal through your assets or your net worth. And, you know, the, the prequalification process is part of our onboarding process.

So we need you to do that because in order for us to represent to you to brokers they're looking for a certain level of financial capability. So that might change in the future. But right now, that will give you some guardrails in terms of whether it makes sense. If you're not sure, You can always fill out the form.

We can have a look and have a conversation and see if it makes sense for you. But as I am the dream killer, I am also the expectation manager. So I, it's not a good business for us to take on folks that we can't help, or it doesn't make financial sense for them to work with us. So it's one of the reasons why we keep doing all these, you know, free workshops and giving free resources.

Because even if you can't, or don't, or aren't able to work with us, I want you to have everything you possibly can to be successful in your own right. [01:24:00] Okay, question from Jesus,

he said, he's just ask, is there a magic minimum threshold for S. D. E. that I should look for that? I can ensure I don't buy a job and I have enough buffer to hire an operator. He says, I know a loaded question. It's a loaded question. Right? And again, it's going to be personal to you, but the way we look at it.

Is how much do you want to make after debt service? Like, what is your comfortable take home number? And then what is the market rate for an operator to be able to work in that business? You know? So it's going to be different for every industry, but you know, if, if you want to make 200 and then a average operator salary is one 50, and then you want to make sure that you leave wiggle room for variability in there.

You know, [01:25:00] I feel like north of 500 is you're definitely getting into a business that has some systems and operators in place. I think we decided like 300, right? Ryan is where, what would you, what would you, what would you answer there? I feel like at least a minimum of no, 300 isn't going to be enough.

It depends on how much you need to take home. How much you want to make. It really just depends. It's, it's hard to have a, not really a black and white question. But we can always, we can always help with that. It's part of what we do in the onboarding process, right? It's like, what are the numbers that make sense for you?

Cause people are like, Oh, I could live off this much. And I'm like, no, no, no, that's not why we're doing this. You're about to like put your whole life into this business. So what makes you comfortable? What covers your family? And a lot of the folks that work with us are, are highly paid. W two's that have mortgages and kids and, you know, tuition or expenses or that sort of thing.

So you want to make sure that you're getting at least enough. For you to be all comfortable. And then if you [01:26:00] want an operator, eventually you want a business that can grow to accommodate the operator salary, or has enough in there to eventually be able to hire one plus margin for wiggle room. So it is a pretty personal, amount, and it's going to be dependent on industry too, because like, you know, Ryan has really extensive online business background and some of these businesses, you know, you can run with a couple of folks.

VAs, whatever remotely as opposed to a landscaping business that needs a bunch of bodies. Sorry, that's a not, not answer to your question. But I, I think as a starting point, use that deal calculator and then look up market rates for operators, right? So you can start, get a sense for all the businesses that you're looking at.

And then, and then double it.

That is it for questions today. Great questions, everybody. Yeah, this was so fun. I appreciate you all. We got 28 of you still here. Thanks for the marathon. That's so [01:27:00] fun We'll be doing more of these soon. We just need to figure out my schedule. Please send us feedback. And you know, if any of these things that we're sharing helped make a difference, we love hearing about that too.

It's what drives me and the team. We all have the same values. We want to help people. So appreciate your most valuable resource, your time. Excited to hear how this all goes. We'll see you on the next one and feel free to steal all our templates and go watch all of the previous ones. So we'll see you next time.

Have a great rest of your day.
