1
00:00:16.795 --> 00:00:19.995
Welcome everyone to this webinar on

2
00:00:21.215 --> 00:00:24.935
tactical EQ to win over sellers and brokers.

3
00:00:25.775 --> 00:00:26.835
My name is Will Smith.

4
00:00:26.935 --> 00:00:29.075
I'm the host of the podcast Acquiring Minds.

5
00:00:29.745 --> 00:00:33.475
Today's speaker is Athena Simpson of Aquabatch.

6
00:00:34.135 --> 00:00:36.395
You have heard Athena's name in a few

7
00:00:36.395 --> 00:00:37.715
Acquiring Minds episodes.

8
00:00:38.165 --> 00:00:41.395
She's helped a few guests on the pod buy their businesses.

9
00:00:42.015 --> 00:00:44.915
She was a searcher herself, so she understands

10
00:00:45.105 --> 00:00:48.235
what it's like, the risks, the highs, the lows.

11
00:00:48.535 --> 00:00:49.955
I'm gonna hand the mic over to Athena

12
00:00:49.955 --> 00:00:52.315
so she can introduce herself here in a second.

13
00:00:53.095 --> 00:00:55.955
The usual housekeeping first, we're recording.

14
00:00:56.015 --> 00:00:57.955
You'll get a link to the recording, uh,

15
00:00:57.975 --> 00:01:00.955
and the slides, uh, in the next day

16
00:01:01.015 --> 00:01:05.075
or so, probably actually toward the end of the day tomorrow.

17
00:01:06.175 --> 00:01:09.275
And if you have a question, um, put it in the q and a.

18
00:01:09.535 --> 00:01:11.835
Uh, use the q and a button here in Zoom.

19
00:01:11.855 --> 00:01:13.115
We have the chat turned off.

20
00:01:13.445 --> 00:01:16.195
We're gonna let Athena run, and then we'll do q

21
00:01:16.195 --> 00:01:17.875
and a with whatever time we have left.

22
00:01:18.215 --> 00:01:20.275
But feel free to put those questions in

23
00:01:20.455 --> 00:01:22.035
as we go as Athena goes.

24
00:01:23.015 --> 00:01:26.075
And I think with that, Athena, please introduce yourself

25
00:01:26.255 --> 00:01:27.475
and take us into your presentation.

26
00:01:28.185 --> 00:01:30.675
Amazing. Thanks for having me again.

27
00:01:30.675 --> 00:01:34.315
Will I have so much fun doing this and so much fun with you.

28
00:01:34.495 --> 00:01:37.155
So, uh, thank you for the opportunity as always.

29
00:01:37.375 --> 00:01:41.035
I'm gonna go ahead and share my screen here.

30
00:01:41.875 --> 00:01:43.715
I think this was a fan favorite last time,

31
00:01:43.715 --> 00:01:45.315
so I'll put myself in front of the slides.

32
00:01:45.455 --> 00:01:47.235
It is an amazing Zoom feature.

33
00:01:48.015 --> 00:01:51.155
Um, those of you that know me know I get a little animated,

34
00:01:51.255 --> 00:01:54.035
so it gives me fun times to do it.

35
00:01:54.095 --> 00:01:58.705
So can you see my slides? Okay. Amazing. Uh, so welcome.

36
00:01:59.155 --> 00:02:02.785
Let's talk about tactical eq. Um, my name is Athena Simpson.

37
00:02:02.965 --> 00:02:04.785
I'm the founder of Acqui Match.

38
00:02:05.445 --> 00:02:08.305
Um, I also call myself an acquisition matchmaker.

39
00:02:08.525 --> 00:02:13.105
So we basically helped first time buyers, uh, become owners

40
00:02:13.685 --> 00:02:14.705
one match at a time.

41
00:02:14.975 --> 00:02:17.065
There's gonna be a lot of dating analogies,

42
00:02:17.245 --> 00:02:19.705
but think of what you're doing out there, scrolling

43
00:02:20.005 --> 00:02:21.425
and, uh, matchmaking.

44
00:02:21.805 --> 00:02:24.745
So, um, a little about me before we get started.

45
00:02:25.505 --> 00:02:27.425
I am a five time founder.

46
00:02:28.135 --> 00:02:31.905
Some successes, lots of failures, got the battle wounds, um,

47
00:02:31.925 --> 00:02:34.225
and 25 years experience building, scaling

48
00:02:34.365 --> 00:02:35.905
and advising businesses.

49
00:02:36.455 --> 00:02:39.825
I've helped thousands of businesses, uh, founders,

50
00:02:39.885 --> 00:02:42.425
future entrepreneurs, start scale and raise capital.

51
00:02:43.565 --> 00:02:47.225
And I've advised Fortune 500 Fs, E 100 investors,

52
00:02:47.225 --> 00:02:50.585
government clients, all over the Gro globe, uh,

53
00:02:50.605 --> 00:02:53.145
across operations, innovation and investment.

54
00:02:53.445 --> 00:02:58.145
Um, and I taught entrepreneurship here in Texas at the

55
00:02:58.175 --> 00:02:59.645
McCombs School of of Business.

56
00:02:59.645 --> 00:03:01.605
It's something that's very close to my heart.

57
00:03:02.145 --> 00:03:04.605
Uh, so much so that I am a very active member

58
00:03:04.665 --> 00:03:06.125
of the ETA community.

59
00:03:06.405 --> 00:03:09.205
I think entrepreneurship is one of the greatest things

60
00:03:09.435 --> 00:03:10.565
that you can do in life.

61
00:03:10.945 --> 00:03:12.285
Um, and buying a business

62
00:03:12.285 --> 00:03:14.485
where somebody has figured out product market fit

63
00:03:14.485 --> 00:03:17.365
and how to get their customers is even better having

64
00:03:17.555 --> 00:03:18.725
been in startup land.

65
00:03:19.265 --> 00:03:21.645
Um, and I am a former fellow searcher,

66
00:03:21.745 --> 00:03:23.525
as will mention, will mentioned.

67
00:03:23.665 --> 00:03:27.685
So, um, I actually lost my perfect business that I was like

68
00:03:28.625 --> 00:03:31.165
so made to be the owner of, um,

69
00:03:31.635 --> 00:03:33.525
because I didn't know how to play the game.

70
00:03:33.595 --> 00:03:37.805
Even after raising $3 million in five days

71
00:03:38.425 --> 00:03:39.445
to prove to the banker

72
00:03:39.585 --> 00:03:42.845
and the broker that I could do it, um, I got outbid

73
00:03:43.105 --> 00:03:47.045
and I didn't know how to structure on a deal of that size.

74
00:03:47.665 --> 00:03:50.325
Um, and so that led me to my passion,

75
00:03:50.325 --> 00:03:52.245
which is helping other amazing people

76
00:03:52.245 --> 00:03:54.565
that would great be great business owners,

77
00:03:55.375 --> 00:03:56.485
avoid that, right?

78
00:03:56.625 --> 00:03:58.125
So when you're looking to buy a business,

79
00:03:58.125 --> 00:04:00.205
you're learning two skill sets, entrepreneurship

80
00:04:00.665 --> 00:04:01.965
and searching for a business.

81
00:04:02.105 --> 00:04:04.525
So a iMatch, we started it two years ago

82
00:04:04.525 --> 00:04:07.525
to help first time buyers through this process of finding,

83
00:04:07.525 --> 00:04:09.605
winning, and closing on their perfect business.

84
00:04:10.705 --> 00:04:13.805
Um, and so today, I've always wanted to say this,

85
00:04:13.865 --> 00:04:15.085
I'm a big Hormo fan.

86
00:04:15.345 --> 00:04:16.845
Uh, I have nothing to sell you.

87
00:04:17.345 --> 00:04:20.525
Um, right now our client load is completely full.

88
00:04:20.535 --> 00:04:22.485
We're not taking on any new clients

89
00:04:22.705 --> 00:04:23.925
for the foreseeable future.

90
00:04:24.305 --> 00:04:25.605
So I'm just here to help.

91
00:04:26.145 --> 00:04:27.845
Um, and there's a lot of stuff in here.

92
00:04:28.085 --> 00:04:29.085
I was telling Will, right

93
00:04:29.085 --> 00:04:31.405
before we, we went live, I could speak

94
00:04:31.605 --> 00:04:32.925
for hours and hours on this.

95
00:04:33.385 --> 00:04:37.085
Um, so I've tried to distill it down, uh, for you.

96
00:04:37.735 --> 00:04:40.765
There will be a cheat sheet going out with the replay.

97
00:04:40.945 --> 00:04:42.765
Um, there's a lot of information

98
00:04:42.765 --> 00:04:43.885
that I'm gonna be going through.

99
00:04:44.105 --> 00:04:45.445
So Will had a great idea

100
00:04:45.445 --> 00:04:48.005
of doing a cheat sheet checklist kind of thing.

101
00:04:48.425 --> 00:04:49.765
Um, so just know that's gonna be coming

102
00:04:49.765 --> 00:04:51.125
with the replay as well.

103
00:04:51.665 --> 00:04:53.845
Um, and also this is kind of a part two.

104
00:04:54.265 --> 00:04:56.885
So, um, if you weren't on part one

105
00:04:56.885 --> 00:04:59.085
that we did about a month ago, building your brand,

106
00:04:59.645 --> 00:05:01.685
I highly recommend going back and watching it.

107
00:05:01.955 --> 00:05:03.685
It's okay if you didn't watch it for today.

108
00:05:03.985 --> 00:05:07.165
Um, but it is very complimentary about thinking

109
00:05:07.265 --> 00:05:08.765
how you're showing up in the world,

110
00:05:09.185 --> 00:05:11.005
and then when you're actually engaging with

111
00:05:11.005 --> 00:05:12.605
that EQ in your brand.

112
00:05:12.825 --> 00:05:16.165
So that's a QR code to the replay if you wanna check

113
00:05:16.165 --> 00:05:17.805
that out, if you weren't on part one.

114
00:05:18.745 --> 00:05:23.485
Um, so today what we're gonna cover is, uh, tactical EQ

115
00:05:23.745 --> 00:05:25.925
for brokers and sellers.

116
00:05:26.345 --> 00:05:28.405
I'm gonna start out with a reality check.

117
00:05:28.585 --> 00:05:31.005
Uh, this is something I do often, um,

118
00:05:31.385 --> 00:05:32.965
to just help you understand the

119
00:05:32.965 --> 00:05:34.085
landscape and where you're at.

120
00:05:34.545 --> 00:05:37.885
Um, and then we're gonna go through a quick recap

121
00:05:37.985 --> 00:05:40.245
of the brand stuff that will be relevant here.

122
00:05:40.575 --> 00:05:42.445
We're gonna talk through broker relationships,

123
00:05:42.445 --> 00:05:44.845
seller mindset, relationship strategy,

124
00:05:45.065 --> 00:05:48.365
and moving from transactional to relational.

125
00:05:49.825 --> 00:05:53.245
So let's start with a reality check.

126
00:05:54.145 --> 00:05:56.085
Um, this is me

127
00:05:56.225 --> 00:05:58.885
and my team at the Texas Association

128
00:05:59.025 --> 00:06:02.565
of Business Brokers event a couple weeks ago.

129
00:06:03.065 --> 00:06:06.045
Um, we got cash on the left with the mustache,

130
00:06:06.415 --> 00:06:07.765
Caris and Luke.

131
00:06:08.095 --> 00:06:10.485
These are our analysts here at a iMatch.

132
00:06:10.545 --> 00:06:14.405
And their job is to go out, speak to brokers, speak

133
00:06:14.425 --> 00:06:18.245
to owners, vet those businesses, do an analysis of 'em,

134
00:06:18.245 --> 00:06:19.405
and put 'em in front of our clients

135
00:06:19.405 --> 00:06:22.525
and help our clients to have those winning conversations,

136
00:06:22.545 --> 00:06:24.285
to get a shot at making an offer there.

137
00:06:24.625 --> 00:06:26.325
So we all went to one

138
00:06:26.325 --> 00:06:28.965
of the largest broker conventions in the country.

139
00:06:29.465 --> 00:06:31.845
Um, Texas Association, a business brokers,

140
00:06:32.015 --> 00:06:33.725
those 200 folks there.

141
00:06:34.265 --> 00:06:37.525
Um, and it's a really sobering experience when you go

142
00:06:37.545 --> 00:06:40.685
and actually surround yourself with the broker community.

143
00:06:41.625 --> 00:06:45.925
Um, most, there's a big barrier to entry when it comes

144
00:06:45.925 --> 00:06:48.805
to being a broker because you have to work for 12

145
00:06:48.865 --> 00:06:50.765
to 24 months without a payment.

146
00:06:51.425 --> 00:06:56.165
Um, so it tends to be a lot of folks that are upper Gen X

147
00:06:56.465 --> 00:06:59.725
or uh, baby boomer generation that are the business brokers.

148
00:06:59.725 --> 00:07:01.245
These are the folks that you're dealing with

149
00:07:01.265 --> 00:07:04.925
and they have decades of experience selling businesses.

150
00:07:05.715 --> 00:07:08.085
Most of that experience was not when the internet caught

151
00:07:08.235 --> 00:07:10.125
wind of buying a business.

152
00:07:10.305 --> 00:07:12.605
So now all of a sudden they're having to deal

153
00:07:12.605 --> 00:07:15.765
with a very different buyer landscape where there used to be

154
00:07:16.465 --> 00:07:18.005
six inquiries on a listing.

155
00:07:18.105 --> 00:07:20.725
Now there's like 200 of 'em within the first hour.

156
00:07:21.385 --> 00:07:23.845
And their perception is that most

157
00:07:24.145 --> 00:07:26.525
of the folks out there are wasting their time.

158
00:07:26.595 --> 00:07:29.205
They don't have any money. They don't have what it takes.

159
00:07:29.545 --> 00:07:31.685
So I'm gonna take you through some of the things

160
00:07:31.755 --> 00:07:35.445
that we heard a lot of, we hear a lot of, you know,

161
00:07:35.445 --> 00:07:37.805
between my team and me, we've done hundreds,

162
00:07:37.805 --> 00:07:40.965
if not maybe thousands of broker calls at this point.

163
00:07:41.505 --> 00:07:43.565
Um, so I wanted to share that insight.

164
00:07:43.665 --> 00:07:46.645
And, and the first one really important for you all

165
00:07:46.665 --> 00:07:49.205
to understand, even though we think it's cool

166
00:07:49.205 --> 00:07:52.045
to be a searcher, the brokers do not, right?

167
00:07:52.195 --> 00:07:55.925
It's a dirty word. They translate it into tire kickers.

168
00:07:56.185 --> 00:07:58.285
So if you're on the phone with a broker,

169
00:07:58.785 --> 00:08:00.605
do not call yourself a searcher.

170
00:08:01.105 --> 00:08:02.365
Um, they don't like it.

171
00:08:02.585 --> 00:08:06.805
Uh, the perceptions of first time buyers, we went

172
00:08:06.925 --> 00:08:10.805
through this a lot in, in part one of building your brand,

173
00:08:11.105 --> 00:08:14.025
but they're not great, right?

174
00:08:14.035 --> 00:08:16.265
Especially if you found this out from the internet

175
00:08:16.265 --> 00:08:18.225
and you're looking at businesses, you know,

176
00:08:18.225 --> 00:08:19.585
maybe industry agnostic.

177
00:08:19.895 --> 00:08:21.265
They just think you're gonna be a headache.

178
00:08:21.265 --> 00:08:22.545
You don't have money, you're

179
00:08:22.545 --> 00:08:23.665
not gonna be able to get it done.

180
00:08:24.095 --> 00:08:26.505
They don't trust you, they don't like you.

181
00:08:26.505 --> 00:08:27.985
You're not asking the right questions,

182
00:08:27.985 --> 00:08:29.585
you're not following the process, basically.

183
00:08:29.615 --> 00:08:31.905
It's not great. 'cause there's a lot of people out there

184
00:08:32.175 --> 00:08:33.865
that are messing it up for those of us

185
00:08:33.865 --> 00:08:36.185
that wanna learn the right way and do this the right way.

186
00:08:36.885 --> 00:08:40.705
So this is hard for most people

187
00:08:42.135 --> 00:08:43.225
when they start this

188
00:08:43.225 --> 00:08:45.145
because we're like, well, I'm a customer.

189
00:08:45.325 --> 00:08:46.425
I'm trying to buy something.

190
00:08:46.445 --> 00:08:50.545
You should service me accordingly. No, um, know your place.

191
00:08:50.895 --> 00:08:53.545
There's 200 of you on every listing

192
00:08:54.085 --> 00:08:55.645
and probably at least 30

193
00:08:55.675 --> 00:08:58.085
that are really highly qualified buyers.

194
00:08:58.785 --> 00:09:02.845
Um, so you're one of many that could buy this business.

195
00:09:03.385 --> 00:09:05.005
Um, and if you don't have,

196
00:09:05.105 --> 00:09:06.765
if you're not showing up in the right way

197
00:09:06.825 --> 00:09:08.645
and you don't have the right experience and,

198
00:09:08.705 --> 00:09:10.485
and you're not giving them confidence,

199
00:09:10.485 --> 00:09:12.765
you're not gonna be one of those, you know, 30

200
00:09:12.835 --> 00:09:14.685
that they've considered qualified.

201
00:09:15.265 --> 00:09:17.365
Um, they're also not gonna chase you.

202
00:09:17.425 --> 00:09:19.285
You're gonna have to chase them, right?

203
00:09:19.475 --> 00:09:23.365
Like they are the ones that are in demand, not you.

204
00:09:23.745 --> 00:09:25.845
So it's a seller's market right now.

205
00:09:26.225 --> 00:09:27.645
And when you understand your place,

206
00:09:27.645 --> 00:09:28.725
you're gonna operate differently.

207
00:09:28.725 --> 00:09:30.885
It's competitive, and you should play it as such.

208
00:09:32.075 --> 00:09:35.285
Also understand that you are being vetted at every single

209
00:09:35.615 --> 00:09:38.525
stage, every single conversation and interaction.

210
00:09:38.825 --> 00:09:41.285
You are being vetted even though you think you're

211
00:09:41.285 --> 00:09:42.405
the one vetting the business.

212
00:09:43.065 --> 00:09:44.245
So when you understand

213
00:09:44.245 --> 00:09:46.365
that you're gonna act differently, right?

214
00:09:46.365 --> 00:09:49.805
Because this whole thing is one big interview,

215
00:09:49.955 --> 00:09:51.925
it's one big courtship.

216
00:09:52.465 --> 00:09:55.125
So just remember that you are being vetted throughout this.

217
00:09:58.445 --> 00:09:59.845
I use this analogy a lot

218
00:09:59.845 --> 00:10:01.925
to help people understand kind of where they're at.

219
00:10:02.105 --> 00:10:03.565
But, you know, buying a business,

220
00:10:03.595 --> 00:10:04.965
it's like the world's largest

221
00:10:05.525 --> 00:10:06.965
business buying poker tournament.

222
00:10:07.505 --> 00:10:11.485
Um, and there are lot of people that know what they're doing

223
00:10:11.915 --> 00:10:14.925
that have gotten to the final table at the World Series,

224
00:10:15.115 --> 00:10:16.565
like multiple times, right?

225
00:10:16.565 --> 00:10:18.685
And here you are a first timer showing up at the World

226
00:10:18.685 --> 00:10:20.125
Series and you're like, I'm gonna get

227
00:10:20.125 --> 00:10:21.525
to the final table and win.

228
00:10:22.225 --> 00:10:24.485
Um, but you haven't played the game before.

229
00:10:24.625 --> 00:10:26.485
You don't know the strategies.

230
00:10:26.505 --> 00:10:30.565
You don't know like what the statistics are in terms

231
00:10:30.565 --> 00:10:32.085
of the cards or how to play people.

232
00:10:32.465 --> 00:10:34.685
So you're up against people that have done this.

233
00:10:35.125 --> 00:10:37.645
Strategic investors, people that have, you know, funding

234
00:10:37.665 --> 00:10:40.605
behind them, private equity, um, people

235
00:10:40.665 --> 00:10:43.085
who have bought businesses before, other business owners

236
00:10:43.465 --> 00:10:46.205
or people like me and my team, right?

237
00:10:46.305 --> 00:10:49.885
We are your competition if you are not a client of ours.

238
00:10:49.905 --> 00:10:53.365
And then here you are a first timer trying to play something

239
00:10:53.365 --> 00:10:55.285
that is incredibly high stakes.

240
00:10:56.105 --> 00:10:57.805
Um, the brokers aren't happy,

241
00:10:58.715 --> 00:11:00.365
they're getting p****d off, right?

242
00:11:00.465 --> 00:11:02.765
You're showing up and you haven't even read the sim

243
00:11:03.185 --> 00:11:04.605
or you're making them think

244
00:11:04.605 --> 00:11:06.125
that you're just wasting their time

245
00:11:06.425 --> 00:11:09.365
and, you know, inquiring on a whole bunch of businesses

246
00:11:09.395 --> 00:11:12.525
that you have no business actually being the owner of.

247
00:11:13.105 --> 00:11:16.565
So, you know, I use this line a lot.

248
00:11:17.915 --> 00:11:19.935
You might be the right owner of a business,

249
00:11:19.995 --> 00:11:21.455
but you're gonna lose this game if you're

250
00:11:21.455 --> 00:11:22.535
not the right buyer.

251
00:11:22.995 --> 00:11:25.775
So everything that I kind of talk about out there is

252
00:11:25.795 --> 00:11:27.335
to help you become the right buyer

253
00:11:27.335 --> 00:11:29.095
because it's, it's happened to me.

254
00:11:29.205 --> 00:11:30.455
I've seen it happen to friends

255
00:11:30.795 --> 00:11:32.175
and a lot of you folks out there,

256
00:11:32.515 --> 00:11:34.815
you probably would be amazing at running that business

257
00:11:34.815 --> 00:11:36.495
that you get really excited about.

258
00:11:37.035 --> 00:11:38.735
But if you're not playing the game in the right way,

259
00:11:38.735 --> 00:11:40.695
you're not gonna become the owner of that business.

260
00:11:42.285 --> 00:11:46.575
Um, there's a QR code again, I'm gonna do a quick, uh,

261
00:11:46.675 --> 00:11:49.215
on the replay from, from part one.

262
00:11:49.755 --> 00:11:51.015
I'm gonna do a quick recap

263
00:11:51.255 --> 00:11:55.325
'cause it just helps set the stage, um, for where you're at.

264
00:11:55.505 --> 00:12:00.255
So when you think of winning, when you think of

265
00:12:00.825 --> 00:12:05.815
being chosen, what is happening right now is kind

266
00:12:05.815 --> 00:12:07.055
of what's happening to cars.

267
00:12:07.285 --> 00:12:10.135
Like, you look the same as every other searcher.

268
00:12:10.715 --> 00:12:12.135
You know, if you're showing up

269
00:12:12.295 --> 00:12:13.895
and you don't, you haven't done this

270
00:12:13.895 --> 00:12:17.055
before, so you want to stand out.

271
00:12:17.075 --> 00:12:19.295
Nobody wants to buy the car.

272
00:12:19.395 --> 00:12:22.575
Really deep down that looks like every other car.

273
00:12:22.755 --> 00:12:24.775
We wanna buy this car.

274
00:12:24.835 --> 00:12:26.455
We wanna buy a car that stands out,

275
00:12:27.765 --> 00:12:30.055
that makes us get excited, that makes us feel good,

276
00:12:30.085 --> 00:12:32.055
that makes us feel like this is right.

277
00:12:32.515 --> 00:12:35.095
So when you're thinking about yourself, it's,

278
00:12:35.125 --> 00:12:37.775
it's all about positioning yourself as the right buyer.

279
00:12:37.835 --> 00:12:40.015
And you're only gonna be the right buyer for certain people.

280
00:12:40.015 --> 00:12:42.375
You're not gonna be the right buyer for everybody, right?

281
00:12:42.875 --> 00:12:45.815
Not everybody wants a gold Corvette.

282
00:12:45.855 --> 00:12:47.055
I, I don't even know what car this is.

283
00:12:47.215 --> 00:12:51.415
I wanna like metallic pink, sparkly Jeep, you know, like,

284
00:12:51.415 --> 00:12:52.735
that's not everybody's car.

285
00:12:52.735 --> 00:12:53.895
That's my dream car.

286
00:12:54.185 --> 00:12:55.855
Think about that with businesses, right?

287
00:12:55.855 --> 00:12:57.415
Like when you make a match,

288
00:12:57.525 --> 00:12:59.535
it's not just about does it have the right amount

289
00:12:59.535 --> 00:13:02.015
of money in the same place that I live?

290
00:13:02.205 --> 00:13:06.055
Like, what makes you the dream car for this person, right?

291
00:13:06.155 --> 00:13:07.615
How do you connect to that business

292
00:13:08.195 --> 00:13:11.495
and do people know, like, and trust you?

293
00:13:11.605 --> 00:13:14.335
This is kind of marketing one-on-one at every

294
00:13:14.485 --> 00:13:15.895
interaction that you have.

295
00:13:15.895 --> 00:13:20.695
Every conversation that you have is about showing that,

296
00:13:20.765 --> 00:13:23.535
that getting people to know you, getting them to like you,

297
00:13:23.535 --> 00:13:25.255
getting them to trust you.

298
00:13:25.885 --> 00:13:27.895
This is with every interaction you have.

299
00:13:27.955 --> 00:13:30.135
So the stronger you are at this

300
00:13:30.195 --> 00:13:31.575
of building the relationship,

301
00:13:31.795 --> 00:13:33.935
the better this process will go

302
00:13:33.955 --> 00:13:35.695
and the more that they'll feel good about you.

303
00:13:37.365 --> 00:13:39.985
Um, I also talked about this last time.

304
00:13:40.305 --> 00:13:44.945
I, I think this is one of the most groundbreaking concepts,

305
00:13:45.005 --> 00:13:46.065
me as a business owner,

306
00:13:46.125 --> 00:13:49.025
as a marketer ever wrapped my head around.

307
00:13:49.805 --> 00:13:51.585
Um, so you can apply it

308
00:13:51.645 --> 00:13:54.745
as a business owner anytime you're marketing something

309
00:13:55.285 --> 00:13:59.215
or marketing yourself the hero's journey, right?

310
00:13:59.555 --> 00:14:01.375
So most of us wanna position ourselves

311
00:14:01.395 --> 00:14:02.895
as the hero in the story,

312
00:14:03.795 --> 00:14:07.095
but we would get more done

313
00:14:07.275 --> 00:14:10.255
by positioning our target as the hero in that journey.

314
00:14:10.255 --> 00:14:13.015
What do I need to do to help them avoid failure

315
00:14:13.395 --> 00:14:14.455
or achieve success?

316
00:14:14.795 --> 00:14:18.895
So in this case, your seller or your broker is your hero.

317
00:14:19.195 --> 00:14:22.695
And what do you need to do to help guide them to that?

318
00:14:22.695 --> 00:14:25.935
Right? And you might not have the experience or knowledge,

319
00:14:25.935 --> 00:14:27.255
but there's things that you can do

320
00:14:27.255 --> 00:14:28.655
to help them in their journey.

321
00:14:29.255 --> 00:14:31.095
'cause a broker might have been going through this

322
00:14:31.165 --> 00:14:34.455
with the owner for years before they even got it listed.

323
00:14:34.965 --> 00:14:36.295
Like they're, they're on it.

324
00:14:36.635 --> 00:14:39.535
So the journey, the hero's journey is, you know,

325
00:14:40.915 --> 00:14:44.015
for example, Cinderella had a really bad situation

326
00:14:44.115 --> 00:14:46.975
and her sisters and her mom were like really mean to her.

327
00:14:47.475 --> 00:14:50.695
And then up shows this fairy godmother that's like, Hey,

328
00:14:50.835 --> 00:14:52.725
so I know you're in a bad place right now.

329
00:14:52.735 --> 00:14:54.965
Would you like me to bibby bobby boo you,

330
00:14:55.095 --> 00:14:56.165
stick you in this pumpkin

331
00:14:56.465 --> 00:14:58.405
so you can like change your life for the better.

332
00:14:58.825 --> 00:15:00.685
And Cinderella's like, oh my God, yes.

333
00:15:00.755 --> 00:15:01.965
Like, put me in that pumpkin.

334
00:15:02.665 --> 00:15:04.165
And so she goes and, and,

335
00:15:04.225 --> 00:15:06.045
and changes her life as a result of that.

336
00:15:06.105 --> 00:15:07.845
The very godmother was the guide

337
00:15:07.985 --> 00:15:09.845
and the one that made that happen, right?

338
00:15:09.895 --> 00:15:11.005
We're helping our heroes

339
00:15:11.005 --> 00:15:13.965
or heroines get the end result that they want.

340
00:15:14.065 --> 00:15:17.045
So think of that with your brokers and your sellers.

341
00:15:17.045 --> 00:15:19.085
Like, what does success look like for them?

342
00:15:19.145 --> 00:15:20.925
Or how can I help them avoid failure?

343
00:15:22.245 --> 00:15:27.105
So when we're talking about brokers, they are your ticket

344
00:15:27.125 --> 00:15:28.185
to business ownership.

345
00:15:30.165 --> 00:15:33.405
Business ownership is the hottest club in town right now.

346
00:15:33.505 --> 00:15:36.725
And the brokers are the bouncers that are there to make sure

347
00:15:37.195 --> 00:15:40.285
that the riffraff doesn't get into the club, right?

348
00:15:40.825 --> 00:15:42.405
So you are the riffraff

349
00:15:42.505 --> 00:15:45.765
unless you figure out what the bouncer wants to see in order

350
00:15:45.765 --> 00:15:50.245
to get into that club, they have a very important job to do.

351
00:15:51.065 --> 00:15:55.565
People have hired them to keep people they don't want out

352
00:15:55.565 --> 00:15:56.805
of their business, out of their lives

353
00:15:56.865 --> 00:15:58.645
and out of those conversations, right?

354
00:15:58.905 --> 00:16:03.215
So think about that. Um, I don't know.

355
00:16:03.375 --> 00:16:05.055
I I I I'm much older now.

356
00:16:05.695 --> 00:16:08.775
I was young in the time of electronic music

357
00:16:09.555 --> 00:16:11.975
not being allowed on, on the radio at the time.

358
00:16:11.975 --> 00:16:13.775
They didn't recognize it as a genre.

359
00:16:14.115 --> 00:16:16.095
So like everything was like underground

360
00:16:16.555 --> 00:16:18.855
and you know, you had to have a piece of paper

361
00:16:18.955 --> 00:16:21.575
to tell you like where to drive on the map

362
00:16:21.675 --> 00:16:23.975
or call up the map point and that sort of thing.

363
00:16:23.975 --> 00:16:26.815
And like, I always made a point of making friends

364
00:16:26.845 --> 00:16:29.575
with the bouncers and the club owners and the promoters

365
00:16:29.575 --> 00:16:32.055
because if I was friends with them

366
00:16:32.115 --> 00:16:34.255
and if I was nice to them, they were more likely

367
00:16:34.275 --> 00:16:36.135
to let me in when there was a really long line.

368
00:16:36.715 --> 00:16:38.775
Um, so just think about that, right?

369
00:16:38.775 --> 00:16:39.855
Like these are the bouncers

370
00:16:39.875 --> 00:16:41.455
and they have a very important job.

371
00:16:42.475 --> 00:16:45.175
So number one is don't be an a*****e.

372
00:16:45.445 --> 00:16:49.375
Like, kindness costs you nothing in life.

373
00:16:50.035 --> 00:16:52.335
And we've gotten to the point where we're so mean

374
00:16:52.435 --> 00:16:53.455
to people all the time

375
00:16:53.655 --> 00:16:55.495
'cause we're so up in our own stresses.

376
00:16:56.315 --> 00:16:59.135
Um, but it doesn't cost you anything to be nice to people.

377
00:16:59.485 --> 00:17:02.135
Nothing at all. Even if somebody else

378
00:17:02.195 --> 00:17:03.335
is being an a*****e, right?

379
00:17:03.335 --> 00:17:05.335
They might have had a really horrible thing happen to them.

380
00:17:05.355 --> 00:17:06.855
You don't know what's going on in their world.

381
00:17:07.755 --> 00:17:12.335
But I will say, if you te have a tendency to be mean

382
00:17:12.335 --> 00:17:14.695
to people all the time, business ownership is not for you.

383
00:17:14.855 --> 00:17:16.175
I don't care what business you buy,

384
00:17:16.175 --> 00:17:17.415
you're gonna end up ruining it

385
00:17:17.415 --> 00:17:19.815
because nobody likes working with a******s.

386
00:17:21.715 --> 00:17:25.145
Don't ask brokers for pick your brains or coffees, um,

387
00:17:25.525 --> 00:17:27.385
or anyone for that matter, right?

388
00:17:27.535 --> 00:17:30.505
Like, somebody's time is valuable

389
00:17:31.165 --> 00:17:33.065
and you are showing up like, hi,

390
00:17:33.185 --> 00:17:35.025
I have literally nothing to offer you.

391
00:17:35.025 --> 00:17:36.385
Would you like to give me an hour

392
00:17:36.385 --> 00:17:37.865
of your time and expertise?

393
00:17:38.605 --> 00:17:42.485
Um, and then on top of that, you maybe,

394
00:17:42.575 --> 00:17:45.685
let's say I give someone a i I stopped doing this ages ago

395
00:17:45.685 --> 00:17:48.325
because I realized, I was like, people wanna pick my brain

396
00:17:48.665 --> 00:17:50.885
and then, then they go off and do nothing with

397
00:17:50.885 --> 00:17:53.285
that information that I just gave them, right?

398
00:17:53.625 --> 00:17:57.285
So I gave an hour or half an hour of my valuable time

399
00:17:57.345 --> 00:18:00.525
and expertise that they went and did nothing with.

400
00:18:01.885 --> 00:18:04.185
So oftentimes pick your brains in coffees.

401
00:18:04.185 --> 00:18:06.105
It's like making you feel like you're being productive,

402
00:18:06.105 --> 00:18:08.625
but if you're not willing to put that stuff into action,

403
00:18:09.175 --> 00:18:10.985
like don't have a conversation with someone,

404
00:18:11.445 --> 00:18:15.305
the best way you can engage with brokers is find a deal

405
00:18:15.415 --> 00:18:18.265
that you are a good fit for and engage them on that.

406
00:18:18.295 --> 00:18:19.785
They are busy. They have hundreds

407
00:18:19.785 --> 00:18:21.105
of people reaching out to 'em.

408
00:18:21.245 --> 00:18:23.305
No, they do not want to have a coffee with you

409
00:18:23.965 --> 00:18:26.465
unless you engage with them on a deal.

410
00:18:26.565 --> 00:18:28.585
You're a serious qualified buyer.

411
00:18:28.885 --> 00:18:30.545
You, you, they like you, right?

412
00:18:30.575 --> 00:18:32.825
Like the tides turn when they realize, oh,

413
00:18:32.825 --> 00:18:36.145
this is somebody serious that I want in my buyer network.

414
00:18:36.485 --> 00:18:38.265
So when I have a deal, I can come to them.

415
00:18:39.205 --> 00:18:42.905
Um, but just please, can we just stop, pick your brains

416
00:18:43.005 --> 00:18:45.105
and coffee chats like across the board,

417
00:18:45.165 --> 00:18:46.185
not just for brokers.

418
00:18:46.685 --> 00:18:49.065
Um, if you want someone's expertise, I,

419
00:18:49.145 --> 00:18:51.025
I did this a lot when I was young, right?

420
00:18:51.085 --> 00:18:53.625
And even now, if I want someone's time, I will be like,

421
00:18:54.135 --> 00:18:55.505
okay, how can I help them?

422
00:18:55.965 --> 00:18:58.825
Or maybe I could just offer to work for free for them.

423
00:18:58.965 --> 00:19:01.065
You know, I got a lot of opportunities when I was young

424
00:19:01.245 --> 00:19:04.505
by just being like, I'm gonna sit here and work for free

425
00:19:04.605 --> 00:19:05.705
and you can give me anything

426
00:19:05.705 --> 00:19:06.985
and you do not need to pay me anything.

427
00:19:06.985 --> 00:19:09.065
And they're like, well, I, I wanna help. You know?

428
00:19:09.485 --> 00:19:11.705
Um, think of how you can add value first,

429
00:19:14.175 --> 00:19:17.715
but just on that note, like, um, oh, I keep doing this.

430
00:19:18.515 --> 00:19:21.435
I exited out of the slides, my bad, get back into that.

431
00:19:22.105 --> 00:19:26.035
There's this button that's like a escape button

432
00:19:29.185 --> 00:19:32.005
on my remote that I always end up hitting when I get excited

433
00:19:32.025 --> 00:19:33.165
and it takes me outta the moment.

434
00:19:33.665 --> 00:19:36.445
Um, we're still with you Athena. Great.

435
00:19:37.855 --> 00:19:42.745
When you, um, engage on a deal that that changes it for,

436
00:19:42.805 --> 00:19:45.185
and they, they'll wanna have a conversation with you, right?

437
00:19:45.215 --> 00:19:48.585
Like, if you're serious and, and you can have conversations

438
00:19:48.585 --> 00:19:49.585
and ask them questions.

439
00:19:49.685 --> 00:19:52.345
So like, they love it when you're like serious about a deal,

440
00:19:52.425 --> 00:19:54.305
a good fit for it and get in touch with them that way.

441
00:19:55.045 --> 00:19:58.465
Um, when you are looking at businesses, you want

442
00:19:58.465 --> 00:20:00.145
to connect yourself to the business.

443
00:20:00.805 --> 00:20:03.305
Nobody likes a player, okay?

444
00:20:03.725 --> 00:20:06.385
So we're gonna use a lot of dating analogies today.

445
00:20:07.045 --> 00:20:09.345
You can feel it when somebody's not serious.

446
00:20:09.525 --> 00:20:11.665
So when they're not like they're not interested in you

447
00:20:11.765 --> 00:20:13.745
for the person you are and finding connections,

448
00:20:13.745 --> 00:20:14.865
it's just like your warm body.

449
00:20:15.215 --> 00:20:16.345
Same thing with businesses.

450
00:20:16.375 --> 00:20:19.145
Like why are you reaching out on that business?

451
00:20:19.445 --> 00:20:21.985
Why are you specifically interested in that business?

452
00:20:22.565 --> 00:20:26.105
Why are you a good fit for that business?

453
00:20:26.445 --> 00:20:28.225
And you wanna make that connection

454
00:20:28.805 --> 00:20:31.025
before you even get on the call

455
00:20:31.325 --> 00:20:33.185
or even inquire about the business.

456
00:20:33.185 --> 00:20:35.865
Because I can't tell you how many brokers I was talking to

457
00:20:36.425 --> 00:20:37.745
a couple weeks ago at the event

458
00:20:37.765 --> 00:20:39.705
and they're like, yeah, if I see somebody like

459
00:20:40.215 --> 00:20:41.745
inquiring on a whole bunch of listings,

460
00:20:41.785 --> 00:20:43.625
I won't even get back to 'em, right?

461
00:20:44.085 --> 00:20:46.025
So like, you need to look like you,

462
00:20:46.605 --> 00:20:51.205
you can be industry agnostic and still be focused.

463
00:20:51.705 --> 00:20:55.245
So one thing you can do is like, hey, I realize

464
00:20:55.245 --> 00:20:56.765
that I don't have roofing experience,

465
00:20:56.785 --> 00:20:59.725
but I'm a, um, real estate investor.

466
00:20:59.725 --> 00:21:01.005
I've overseen roofs on my house

467
00:21:01.025 --> 00:21:03.565
and I see that the current owner does B2C sales.

468
00:21:04.045 --> 00:21:07.965
I have experience in B2C sales, so I will have a, you know,

469
00:21:08.075 --> 00:21:10.485
knowledge gap, but I'm willing to do it.

470
00:21:10.485 --> 00:21:12.685
Or here's what I'm already doing to bridge

471
00:21:12.685 --> 00:21:14.365
that knowledge gap, right?

472
00:21:14.435 --> 00:21:16.805
I've connected myself to the business even though I don't

473
00:21:16.805 --> 00:21:18.485
have the direct industry experience.

474
00:21:19.975 --> 00:21:21.435
Um, and do your homework.

475
00:21:21.695 --> 00:21:25.155
So nothing p****s off brokers more than you

476
00:21:25.215 --> 00:21:26.315
not reading the sim.

477
00:21:26.425 --> 00:21:27.835
Like they spent so much time.

478
00:21:28.145 --> 00:21:29.555
Well, it depends on the broker, right?

479
00:21:29.625 --> 00:21:33.155
Some sims are like, what, what is even this one page

480
00:21:33.495 --> 00:21:34.555
and other sims, they,

481
00:21:34.555 --> 00:21:36.635
they went into like insane amounts of detail.

482
00:21:37.095 --> 00:21:39.475
And if you jump on a call with them before reading that

483
00:21:39.495 --> 00:21:41.475
and understanding that, or if you're asking questions

484
00:21:41.475 --> 00:21:43.995
that are already in the sim, then they're thinking like,

485
00:21:44.065 --> 00:21:45.555
okay, if you're missing that detail,

486
00:21:45.555 --> 00:21:47.115
what are you gonna be like as a business owner

487
00:21:47.135 --> 00:21:49.555
or a buyer throughout this process, right?

488
00:21:49.815 --> 00:21:52.835
It wastes their time and it also positions you as somebody

489
00:21:52.835 --> 00:21:55.755
that is not gonna be able to do what's necessary.

490
00:21:55.785 --> 00:21:59.065
There's so much logistics

491
00:21:59.565 --> 00:22:02.425
and things that need to happen during due diligence.

492
00:22:02.765 --> 00:22:06.545
Uh, a stat we heard at the event was like, 50%

493
00:22:06.545 --> 00:22:09.705
of deals are falling apart after, after LOI

494
00:22:09.705 --> 00:22:11.585
because the diligence isn't managed correctly.

495
00:22:12.205 --> 00:22:14.065
Um, so they're, they're vetting you, right?

496
00:22:14.325 --> 00:22:16.425
If you can't even read the sim,

497
00:22:16.615 --> 00:22:19.065
what are you gonna be like when it gets to diligence time?

498
00:22:19.725 --> 00:22:23.465
Um, this was, this was, well, communication is the key

499
00:22:23.465 --> 00:22:24.505
to a good relationship.

500
00:22:24.565 --> 00:22:27.425
We, we had fun coming up with some, some analogies,

501
00:22:27.525 --> 00:22:30.565
but it is very important

502
00:22:30.825 --> 00:22:32.645
to be responsive and communicative.

503
00:22:32.955 --> 00:22:34.525
Just like when you're dating someone,

504
00:22:34.905 --> 00:22:37.565
if you know they're taking days to get back to you,

505
00:22:38.425 --> 00:22:40.685
if they're messing you around, if you can kind of feel

506
00:22:40.685 --> 00:22:42.365
that they're like half in, half out,

507
00:22:42.385 --> 00:22:43.565
or maybe they're dating other people

508
00:22:43.625 --> 00:22:45.405
and they're not telling you, but you're like, I can tell.

509
00:22:45.945 --> 00:22:49.645
Um, like, just communicate, be responsive, show up.

510
00:22:49.845 --> 00:22:51.365
I can't tell you how far it goes

511
00:22:51.515 --> 00:22:53.805
that you always lobb the bat ball

512
00:22:53.805 --> 00:22:54.925
back in their court, right?

513
00:22:54.995 --> 00:22:57.485
They respond to you and you're like getting back to 'em

514
00:22:57.525 --> 00:22:59.285
as soon as you possibly can.

515
00:22:59.765 --> 00:23:02.125
I tell my clients this, and I talk about this a lot.

516
00:23:02.355 --> 00:23:05.445
Corporate time and deal time are not in the same

517
00:23:07.325 --> 00:23:08.695
like reality at all.

518
00:23:08.805 --> 00:23:11.775
Deal time is like, you need to move fast, fast, fast, right?

519
00:23:11.845 --> 00:23:15.495
Like take up smoking and like go on a smoke break.

520
00:23:15.555 --> 00:23:18.375
If you're in your office, you could go out every like hour

521
00:23:18.375 --> 00:23:20.375
and check your email and get back to 'em.

522
00:23:20.835 --> 00:23:24.865
Um, it's, it's something

523
00:23:24.975 --> 00:23:27.785
that will indicate whether you are gonna be a good buyer

524
00:23:27.805 --> 00:23:30.385
and a good owner and also your interest in the deal.

525
00:23:30.605 --> 00:23:32.965
And to that effect, um,

526
00:23:36.015 --> 00:23:38.475
you wanna show them that you're serious about this.

527
00:23:38.695 --> 00:23:40.515
So if you show up, um,

528
00:23:40.855 --> 00:23:44.035
and you're, you're not positioning yourself well,

529
00:23:44.035 --> 00:23:46.205
you're not talking through, you know

530
00:23:46.345 --> 00:23:47.525
how you're looking at it.

531
00:23:47.585 --> 00:23:50.325
If you're not showing them why you're connected to the deal,

532
00:23:50.345 --> 00:23:52.085
if you're not showing them you've done your homework,

533
00:23:52.585 --> 00:23:55.045
you can also show up and say like, here's my resume.

534
00:23:55.425 --> 00:23:57.605
Here's my SBA prequalification.

535
00:23:57.925 --> 00:23:59.805
I have already got this deal team in place.

536
00:23:59.805 --> 00:24:01.285
Here's my personal financial statement.

537
00:24:01.285 --> 00:24:02.565
Here's everything I'm doing

538
00:24:03.425 --> 00:24:06.245
and things I've invested in to show that I'm serious

539
00:24:06.265 --> 00:24:07.445
and I've got skin in the game.

540
00:24:07.705 --> 00:24:10.565
You know, our clients, uh, that goes a really long way

541
00:24:10.715 --> 00:24:12.565
with lenders and brokers

542
00:24:12.565 --> 00:24:14.245
and sellers that they've paid someone

543
00:24:14.345 --> 00:24:15.605
to help them through this process.

544
00:24:16.465 --> 00:24:17.725
Um, 'cause there's a lot of people

545
00:24:17.725 --> 00:24:19.445
that genuinely are tire kickers

546
00:24:19.445 --> 00:24:21.845
and they like the idea of buying a business more than the

547
00:24:21.845 --> 00:24:24.205
actual, um, reality of what it takes.

548
00:24:25.715 --> 00:24:29.975
Um, this is another fun one from Will I see You, right?

549
00:24:30.125 --> 00:24:33.335
Like, we wanna feel seen, we wanna feel understood.

550
00:24:34.605 --> 00:24:37.495
Brokers have one of the most wild jobs ever.

551
00:24:38.925 --> 00:24:42.605
I mean, we, we were asking war stories at this event and,

552
00:24:42.705 --> 00:24:46.045
and Cash talked to a guy that had, uh,

553
00:24:46.645 --> 00:24:49.605
I can't remember which side, but like buyer and seller

554
00:24:49.625 --> 00:24:51.725
and someone stabbed each other, right?

555
00:24:51.875 --> 00:24:53.365
Like, they go

556
00:24:53.365 --> 00:24:57.285
through some wild stuff when they are a broker.

557
00:24:58.015 --> 00:24:59.325
Maybe not to that extent,

558
00:25:00.025 --> 00:25:01.645
but you know, now they have

559
00:25:01.645 --> 00:25:02.925
to sift through hundreds of people.

560
00:25:03.745 --> 00:25:05.565
Um, if you talk to them about that

561
00:25:05.785 --> 00:25:08.285
and like, Hey, I, I know you have a really tough job.

562
00:25:08.595 --> 00:25:10.285
Like, I understand you.

563
00:25:10.445 --> 00:25:12.325
I know there's a lot of people that are not serious,

564
00:25:12.355 --> 00:25:13.405
they're not qualified.

565
00:25:13.805 --> 00:25:15.685
I do not intend on being one of those people.

566
00:25:16.585 --> 00:25:19.205
Um, you know, and, and they appreciate that.

567
00:25:19.385 --> 00:25:21.165
And I always, I always joke

568
00:25:21.265 --> 00:25:24.445
and I laugh, you know, like this is part of the EQ thing.

569
00:25:24.625 --> 00:25:26.765
You can be a human and have a real relationship

570
00:25:26.865 --> 00:25:28.965
and like, Hey, uh, wow,

571
00:25:29.105 --> 00:25:31.325
the internet really likes business buying right now.

572
00:25:31.325 --> 00:25:32.525
Like, that must be tough for you.

573
00:25:32.525 --> 00:25:33.605
And they're like, yeah, you know,

574
00:25:33.605 --> 00:25:36.285
and you're automatically like breaking down those walls and,

575
00:25:36.345 --> 00:25:37.925
and you see them in that

576
00:25:38.025 --> 00:25:42.325
and people that feel understood, like you better,

577
00:25:42.945 --> 00:25:47.725
um, on, on my very big deal that I was one

578
00:25:47.725 --> 00:25:52.005
of 14 offers on, um, the broker

579
00:25:53.015 --> 00:25:55.445
every, almost every night during that deal,

580
00:25:55.725 --> 00:25:58.285
I would be on the other end of the phone listening

581
00:25:58.285 --> 00:26:00.965
to the broker tell me all his grievances

582
00:26:00.965 --> 00:26:02.845
with all the horrible buyers out there.

583
00:26:03.075 --> 00:26:06.245
Like it was a lot of my time listening to

584
00:26:06.265 --> 00:26:08.125
how horrible all this stuff was.

585
00:26:08.185 --> 00:26:10.205
But he liked me because I did that for him

586
00:26:10.545 --> 00:26:12.405
and I was kind of his confidant through it.

587
00:26:12.785 --> 00:26:15.525
And guess what? I was the only one out of 14 buyers

588
00:26:15.555 --> 00:26:18.365
that was allowed to meet the sellers in person, right?

589
00:26:18.515 --> 00:26:21.645
Like being a human and treating people well

590
00:26:21.645 --> 00:26:23.725
and making them feel understood is,

591
00:26:23.945 --> 00:26:27.405
is it can go a long way on top of that.

592
00:26:27.555 --> 00:26:30.725
Like ghosting someone, ghosting a broker

593
00:26:31.355 --> 00:26:35.165
when they've done work to, you know, get you an NDA signed,

594
00:26:35.225 --> 00:26:37.085
get you a sim, maybe have a call with you,

595
00:26:37.085 --> 00:26:38.685
maybe even introduce you to the seller.

596
00:26:39.625 --> 00:26:40.805
Do not ghost them.

597
00:26:41.315 --> 00:26:44.735
Like everybody here I think understands a

598
00:26:44.735 --> 00:26:45.895
sales process, right?

599
00:26:45.925 --> 00:26:47.935
Like, if you have somebody that engaged you

600
00:26:47.935 --> 00:26:50.615
and took your time and they just ghost you, you're like,

601
00:26:50.615 --> 00:26:52.335
well cool, I'm not talking to you again.

602
00:26:52.955 --> 00:26:57.385
Um, if you're not a fit, let them know early

603
00:26:57.845 --> 00:26:59.945
and let them know why.

604
00:27:00.445 --> 00:27:03.505
You know, so like, hey, I really appreciate your time

605
00:27:03.505 --> 00:27:06.985
and effort, but I'm not the right buyer and here's why.

606
00:27:07.245 --> 00:27:09.465
But I would love to engage with you on future ones.

607
00:27:09.465 --> 00:27:10.625
I really liked working with you. I

608
00:27:10.625 --> 00:27:11.785
appreciate all the work you put in.

609
00:27:12.255 --> 00:27:14.305
This goes so far with them

610
00:27:14.305 --> 00:27:16.945
because most people think it's transactional.

611
00:27:16.945 --> 00:27:19.745
They're just like, I gotta sim I had a call.

612
00:27:19.985 --> 00:27:21.505
I don't need to let this person know.

613
00:27:21.605 --> 00:27:24.105
I'm no longer interested. Like, why are y'all doing that?

614
00:27:24.285 --> 00:27:28.705
That's not cool. Um,

615
00:27:32.405 --> 00:27:35.415
something car from my team, she, she's former,

616
00:27:35.755 --> 00:27:37.615
um, sell side.

617
00:27:37.795 --> 00:27:40.735
She actually sold her parents' business in the university.

618
00:27:40.915 --> 00:27:43.735
That's how she got into the industry. It's pretty cool.

619
00:27:44.195 --> 00:27:47.775
Um, so she was doing a lot of recon with these brokers

620
00:27:47.795 --> 00:27:50.095
and kind of seeing what was going on with them

621
00:27:50.155 --> 00:27:51.535
and from her own experience.

622
00:27:52.045 --> 00:27:53.455
Like remember

623
00:27:53.685 --> 00:27:57.815
that somebody's paycheck is dependent on one person making

624
00:27:57.815 --> 00:27:58.855
it through the finish line.

625
00:27:58.915 --> 00:28:02.815
And they will have done sometimes a year, two years of work,

626
00:28:03.585 --> 00:28:06.695
maybe even longer to get the seller there.

627
00:28:07.515 --> 00:28:09.815
And you need to show them

628
00:28:09.815 --> 00:28:14.135
that you're worth the risk worth them betting their six

629
00:28:14.135 --> 00:28:15.135
figure paycheck on.

630
00:28:15.275 --> 00:28:17.495
And then on top of that will rightly pointed out,

631
00:28:17.495 --> 00:28:21.415
there's only so many introductions that a broker can make

632
00:28:21.415 --> 00:28:24.055
to a seller without exhausting them and

633
00:28:24.075 --> 00:28:26.735
or making them like, you know, look competent.

634
00:28:26.795 --> 00:28:29.455
So if they just in introduce anyone to them,

635
00:28:30.655 --> 00:28:31.995
the seller's gonna get run down.

636
00:28:32.415 --> 00:28:34.915
Or, I mean, I heard a lot of stories this last at the,

637
00:28:34.915 --> 00:28:37.995
at the event of losing listings over

638
00:28:38.595 --> 00:28:40.355
introducing the wrong buyer, you know,

639
00:28:40.415 --> 00:28:42.835
or a buyer that did some wild stuff on the call

640
00:28:42.855 --> 00:28:46.035
or didn't know protocol or, you know, didn't seem serious.

641
00:28:46.335 --> 00:28:48.395
And the sellers were like, what are you even doing?

642
00:28:48.575 --> 00:28:50.355
Why have I engaged you? Right?

643
00:28:50.895 --> 00:28:54.155
So are you worth the risk and an introduction?

644
00:28:54.605 --> 00:28:55.835
Think about that, right?

645
00:28:55.945 --> 00:29:00.355
Like, if your multi six figure paycheck was

646
00:29:00.465 --> 00:29:03.075
reliant on somebody that you were talking to,

647
00:29:03.335 --> 00:29:05.995
how would you be scrutinizing them and vetting them?

648
00:29:06.655 --> 00:29:09.195
And are you gonna treat them differently now as a result of

649
00:29:09.195 --> 00:29:11.075
that understanding the risk they are taking

650
00:29:11.495 --> 00:29:13.795
by introducing you and putting you through the process.

651
00:29:15.375 --> 00:29:18.835
So you gotta also remember the broker wants

652
00:29:18.835 --> 00:29:19.955
the deal to close too.

653
00:29:20.335 --> 00:29:23.355
So treat your broker well, show them you're serious

654
00:29:23.495 --> 00:29:25.995
and you can close and you can turn them from a

655
00:29:25.995 --> 00:29:27.395
gatekeeper into a champion.

656
00:29:28.395 --> 00:29:30.755
I can't tell you how many of my clients have brokers

657
00:29:30.755 --> 00:29:33.555
that are like strategizing with them to try to figure out

658
00:29:33.555 --> 00:29:36.075
how to get a winning deal and get it over the line.

659
00:29:36.735 --> 00:29:39.795
And once you're in LOI, once you've signed the LOI,

660
00:29:39.795 --> 00:29:40.875
the broker works for you.

661
00:29:40.985 --> 00:29:44.645
The paycheck comes from your payment, right?

662
00:29:45.025 --> 00:29:47.965
So even though they do represent the seller, you are the one

663
00:29:47.965 --> 00:29:49.485
that's going to help them get paid.

664
00:29:49.485 --> 00:29:51.645
They want the deal to close. That's why they're there.

665
00:29:51.645 --> 00:29:55.045
They're an intermediary helping the deal get over the line.

666
00:29:55.265 --> 00:29:58.125
So they're not an adversary, they're just doing their job

667
00:29:59.105 --> 00:30:01.725
of making sure that the riffraff doesn't get through

668
00:30:01.725 --> 00:30:03.085
and that they're choosing the right person

669
00:30:03.185 --> 00:30:04.725
to actually get it over the finish line.

670
00:30:04.985 --> 00:30:06.885
So, um,

671
00:30:08.205 --> 00:30:10.015
this is a fun dating story,

672
00:30:10.275 --> 00:30:14.855
but, um, I had this girlfriend when I was single

673
00:30:15.195 --> 00:30:18.255
and like she would always get asked on a, you know,

674
00:30:18.255 --> 00:30:20.855
second date guys were just always enamored with her.

675
00:30:20.955 --> 00:30:23.735
And I was, you know, women talk a lot when they're single

676
00:30:23.795 --> 00:30:25.535
and they're dating and it's like, what are you doing?

677
00:30:25.635 --> 00:30:27.535
And she's like, well, I just always make sure

678
00:30:28.165 --> 00:30:29.415
when I go on a date with someone

679
00:30:29.415 --> 00:30:31.015
that I make sure they have a great time.

680
00:30:31.515 --> 00:30:34.215
You know, I ask them a ton of questions, I laugh,

681
00:30:34.355 --> 00:30:38.295
I'm engaging, I'm like open in terms of energy.

682
00:30:38.955 --> 00:30:41.175
And so it always puts the ball in my court

683
00:30:41.175 --> 00:30:42.975
because they always want a second date

684
00:30:42.975 --> 00:30:45.535
because I showed up in a way that made them feel good

685
00:30:45.635 --> 00:30:47.015
and made them have a good time.

686
00:30:48.435 --> 00:30:50.215
But then she got to be the one choosing.

687
00:30:50.515 --> 00:30:53.895
So I, I was, you know, most

688
00:30:53.955 --> 00:30:55.975
of us when we were dating,

689
00:30:55.995 --> 00:30:58.215
or at least me when I was single, I was going on a date

690
00:30:58.215 --> 00:30:59.255
and I was like, what's wrong with you?

691
00:30:59.405 --> 00:31:02.055
Show me all your red flags right now. I don't trust you.

692
00:31:02.245 --> 00:31:06.415
Like, and you can feel that energy on the other side.

693
00:31:06.595 --> 00:31:08.655
So like, we've heard all the horror stories

694
00:31:08.675 --> 00:31:10.735
of deals going wrong or bad brokers

695
00:31:11.075 --> 00:31:12.575
and you're probably getting on the call like,

696
00:31:12.885 --> 00:31:14.375
what am I not figuring out?

697
00:31:14.375 --> 00:31:15.815
What, how are you gonna screw me over?

698
00:31:15.815 --> 00:31:17.535
What's the seller doing that's I'm trusting?

699
00:31:17.675 --> 00:31:20.855
So like, you know, that energy doesn't feel good

700
00:31:20.855 --> 00:31:22.495
and it's not something you wanna engage with.

701
00:31:22.595 --> 00:31:24.775
And when I started flipping, I was like, okay,

702
00:31:24.775 --> 00:31:27.775
rather than looking for what I don't like in someone

703
00:31:27.795 --> 00:31:31.655
or trying to spot the red flags, let me flip to let me look

704
00:31:31.655 --> 00:31:33.895
for what I like, you know, and let me have fun.

705
00:31:34.045 --> 00:31:35.695
Like I was a standup comedian.

706
00:31:35.855 --> 00:31:37.855
I love laughing and joking and that sort of thing.

707
00:31:37.855 --> 00:31:39.455
Like let me show them that side of me.

708
00:31:39.915 --> 00:31:41.335
And, and sure enough, you know,

709
00:31:41.335 --> 00:31:43.375
like I got different results, uh, from

710
00:31:43.375 --> 00:31:46.735
that I'm now happily in a, you know, home in a relationship.

711
00:31:47.235 --> 00:31:50.175
Um, but it was a very painful experience for me.

712
00:31:50.195 --> 00:31:52.095
And I think that very much applies to

713
00:31:52.735 --> 00:31:53.855
building relationships in general.

714
00:31:54.115 --> 00:31:56.015
So when you're engaging with that broker,

715
00:31:56.155 --> 00:31:59.775
if you show up in a way that gives them a good experience

716
00:31:59.775 --> 00:32:03.375
of you, they're gonna want to move you to the next stage.

717
00:32:03.915 --> 00:32:07.935
We just had a, a newer client get on broker call.

718
00:32:08.435 --> 00:32:10.575
Broker was like, there's a process.

719
00:32:10.795 --> 00:32:13.135
You're not gonna meet the seller, dah dah, dah, dah, dah.

720
00:32:13.475 --> 00:32:14.935
And he showed up so prepared

721
00:32:15.235 --> 00:32:17.615
and like knew his strategy was to win him over.

722
00:32:17.875 --> 00:32:19.975
And by the end of it, the broker was like, okay,

723
00:32:19.995 --> 00:32:22.575
so I'd like you to come do a two hour in-person meeting

724
00:32:22.575 --> 00:32:25.375
with the seller, literally in the same call, right?

725
00:32:26.195 --> 00:32:31.075
So this stuff works, um, on the,

726
00:32:31.265 --> 00:32:32.595
this is one of the wordy slides.

727
00:32:32.655 --> 00:32:34.635
So take a snapshot of this one

728
00:32:34.655 --> 00:32:37.515
and it will be in the, um, checklist as well.

729
00:32:37.855 --> 00:32:41.645
But you're not, not on that first call with the broker just

730
00:32:41.665 --> 00:32:42.925
to understand the business.

731
00:32:43.305 --> 00:32:45.245
You wanna understand how the broker works

732
00:32:45.385 --> 00:32:47.045
and this can go very far with them.

733
00:32:47.325 --> 00:32:48.485
'cause they all have a different process.

734
00:32:48.865 --> 00:32:52.245
So, um, do they prefer you to text, call, or email?

735
00:32:52.665 --> 00:32:54.445
How would they like you to interact with the seller

736
00:32:54.495 --> 00:32:55.725
after you've been introduced?

737
00:32:55.725 --> 00:32:57.925
Some are hands off, some are like, don't ever speak

738
00:32:57.925 --> 00:32:59.565
to them without speaking to me first, right?

739
00:33:00.105 --> 00:33:03.045
If you ask them this stuff, then it shows like how much you,

740
00:33:03.505 --> 00:33:05.805
um, care about keeping the relationship

741
00:33:05.805 --> 00:33:07.365
with the broker good.

742
00:33:07.705 --> 00:33:09.805
Rather than being like, let me get you out of the way

743
00:33:09.805 --> 00:33:11.125
so I can get into the nightclub.

744
00:33:11.185 --> 00:33:12.325
You know? Um,

745
00:33:13.265 --> 00:33:15.165
and this bonus question here at the bottom,

746
00:33:15.785 --> 00:33:17.125
is there anything I should have

747
00:33:17.125 --> 00:33:18.245
asked you that I haven't already?

748
00:33:18.955 --> 00:33:23.005
This hands down has gotten me more intel on businesses than

749
00:33:23.025 --> 00:33:24.365
any other question I've ever asked

750
00:33:24.715 --> 00:33:27.045
because they're just answering your questions.

751
00:33:27.045 --> 00:33:28.405
So they assume you've read the sim

752
00:33:28.425 --> 00:33:30.045
or they assume you have all the information.

753
00:33:30.465 --> 00:33:31.805
So at the end of it I'll be like, Hey,

754
00:33:31.865 --> 00:33:33.165
is there anything I should have asked

755
00:33:33.225 --> 00:33:34.365
you that I haven't already?

756
00:33:34.545 --> 00:33:36.565
And they'll divulge all sorts of stuff.

757
00:33:36.565 --> 00:33:39.445
Like, oh, there's, you know, a lawsuit happening right now,

758
00:33:39.465 --> 00:33:41.485
or, oh, you should know about this thing over here.

759
00:33:41.725 --> 00:33:43.565
And it's like, oh my God. Like, of course.

760
00:33:44.105 --> 00:33:45.725
Um, so the that,

761
00:33:46.025 --> 00:33:48.525
if you take nothing else away from this talk,

762
00:33:48.535 --> 00:33:49.845
start asking that question.

763
00:33:50.505 --> 00:33:53.165
You can do it in interviews, you can do it in all sorts

764
00:33:53.285 --> 00:33:54.605
of places, but it's, it's brilliant

765
00:33:54.625 --> 00:33:56.125
and they like it and it makes 'em think.

766
00:33:56.665 --> 00:33:58.365
Um, and it also makes 'em feel like

767
00:33:58.365 --> 00:33:59.605
you're asking them for advice.

768
00:33:59.665 --> 00:34:01.645
So it's good. Okay,

769
00:34:01.895 --> 00:34:06.485
quick coffee seller mindset.

770
00:34:06.945 --> 00:34:08.565
So we're shifting tack now.

771
00:34:08.565 --> 00:34:11.205
And you have different tactics with your brokers

772
00:34:11.205 --> 00:34:15.135
and need you with your sellers picture

773
00:34:15.265 --> 00:34:17.255
where your seller's at through this process.

774
00:34:17.485 --> 00:34:18.975
They're not selling a business,

775
00:34:19.365 --> 00:34:20.895
they're ending a relationship.

776
00:34:21.725 --> 00:34:24.055
This is like getting a divorce, right?

777
00:34:24.405 --> 00:34:27.055
It's one of the most painful things they'll probably go

778
00:34:27.055 --> 00:34:29.215
through and it's fraught with a lot of emotions.

779
00:34:29.835 --> 00:34:32.535
So imagine what your seller is going through.

780
00:34:32.965 --> 00:34:35.695
It's endings, endings of relationships

781
00:34:35.765 --> 00:34:37.695
with customers and their team.

782
00:34:38.125 --> 00:34:40.255
They have to have a bunch of secrecy.

783
00:34:40.255 --> 00:34:42.895
They, they might even be hiding this from their spouse with,

784
00:34:42.905 --> 00:34:44.855
which feels out of integrity for them.

785
00:34:45.085 --> 00:34:47.615
They're under intense scrutiny like they've never

786
00:34:47.615 --> 00:34:50.015
experienced before when they thought they built something

787
00:34:50.015 --> 00:34:52.495
wonderful and it's being picked apart

788
00:34:52.715 --> 00:34:55.295
and their whole identity is coming into question for many

789
00:34:55.295 --> 00:34:58.695
of these folks, they've only known this business

790
00:34:58.695 --> 00:35:03.375
and this work, so who are they after this process, right?

791
00:35:03.715 --> 00:35:06.255
And then there's the valuation of their life's work, which,

792
00:35:06.355 --> 00:35:07.495
you know, to them it's like,

793
00:35:07.525 --> 00:35:10.095
this might be their only retirement plan.

794
00:35:10.285 --> 00:35:11.975
This might be their 401k,

795
00:35:11.995 --> 00:35:14.215
and they're being told that it's not worth

796
00:35:14.245 --> 00:35:15.455
what they thought it was gonna be.

797
00:35:15.565 --> 00:35:17.495
This is a really emotional thing,

798
00:35:18.075 --> 00:35:20.095
and for those of you that have been through divorce

799
00:35:20.355 --> 00:35:22.935
or have had friends that have gone through it, you know,

800
00:35:23.165 --> 00:35:25.215
it's, it's, it's awful, right?

801
00:35:25.355 --> 00:35:30.195
And it's kind of similar. So what I help,

802
00:35:30.795 --> 00:35:33.285
I I, I like using

803
00:35:34.485 --> 00:35:37.365
dating analogies when you're dealing with a seller to kind

804
00:35:37.365 --> 00:35:39.485
of think of where you're at in the relationship

805
00:35:40.305 --> 00:35:42.085
and what you should be doing at different

806
00:35:42.085 --> 00:35:43.325
stages of the relationship.

807
00:35:43.705 --> 00:35:47.045
And I'll caveat this by saying, um, you know,

808
00:35:47.045 --> 00:35:50.645
oftentimes you might be gate kept, um, from the broker,

809
00:35:50.705 --> 00:35:52.245
you won't be able to do these sorts of things.

810
00:35:52.545 --> 00:35:55.245
We do off market deals with clients too,

811
00:35:55.665 --> 00:35:57.645
so you get a little bit more time depending on

812
00:35:57.645 --> 00:35:59.045
where the relationship came from.

813
00:35:59.465 --> 00:36:02.005
So obviously mix and match and take what you can from it.

814
00:36:02.005 --> 00:36:03.565
But just always be thinking about like,

815
00:36:03.625 --> 00:36:05.125
how well do I know this person?

816
00:36:05.615 --> 00:36:07.045
Where am I at in a relationship?

817
00:36:07.545 --> 00:36:09.965
So buying a business is like dating with the goal

818
00:36:09.965 --> 00:36:11.085
of marriage, right?

819
00:36:11.095 --> 00:36:12.245
We're serious.

820
00:36:12.665 --> 00:36:14.285
Our intentions are serious,

821
00:36:14.315 --> 00:36:16.365
they're noble, we're not players.

822
00:36:16.625 --> 00:36:17.765
We wanna find the one.

823
00:36:18.345 --> 00:36:20.645
Um, so think about that as you're going through this.

824
00:36:20.705 --> 00:36:23.005
How might you approach that in dating, right?

825
00:36:23.145 --> 00:36:25.485
To build a foundation for a successful partnership.

826
00:36:26.855 --> 00:36:28.315
The first time you meet a seller, think

827
00:36:28.315 --> 00:36:29.315
of it like a coffee date.

828
00:36:30.175 --> 00:36:31.315
All you're trying to do on

829
00:36:31.315 --> 00:36:34.315
that first one is decide whether you like them enough

830
00:36:34.335 --> 00:36:36.315
to move into the next stage.

831
00:36:38.115 --> 00:36:40.165
Then you can start your courtship, right?

832
00:36:40.345 --> 00:36:43.365
So putting effort in to see if it's the real deal.

833
00:36:43.505 --> 00:36:46.005
You're behind the scenes, you're reviewing financials,

834
00:36:46.005 --> 00:36:48.045
you're doing research, you're starting your modeling.

835
00:36:48.585 --> 00:36:51.965
Really the outcome that you want from that is, can I say yes

836
00:36:52.625 --> 00:36:55.325
to seeing my life together with this person

837
00:36:55.825 --> 00:36:57.005
or with this business?

838
00:36:57.795 --> 00:37:01.165
Then in step three, we start getting into the real convos,

839
00:37:01.585 --> 00:37:03.045
asking the hard questions.

840
00:37:03.545 --> 00:37:04.605
How do you feel about children?

841
00:37:04.745 --> 00:37:06.205
What's your view on politics?

842
00:37:06.305 --> 00:37:08.485
All of those things that need to be got out of the way

843
00:37:08.585 --> 00:37:11.805
to make sure it's going to be a good partnership

844
00:37:11.805 --> 00:37:12.925
and you're gonna be in alignment.

845
00:37:13.625 --> 00:37:15.565
Um, do this in person.

846
00:37:15.665 --> 00:37:19.965
If you can, um, get away from the computer

847
00:37:19.985 --> 00:37:22.005
and go have these hard conversations in person,

848
00:37:22.065 --> 00:37:23.605
it goes a very far away.

849
00:37:24.465 --> 00:37:26.765
And then maybe we're getting to visit the house, right?

850
00:37:27.465 --> 00:37:30.725
Do a site visit. This is if you're allowed to.

851
00:37:31.305 --> 00:37:34.405
Um, and obviously, you know, there, there might be like,

852
00:37:34.465 --> 00:37:36.485
it might be after hours and that sort of thing,

853
00:37:36.505 --> 00:37:41.455
but really you wanna see, can I see myself living here?

854
00:37:41.595 --> 00:37:44.175
And I can't tell you how many times I was looking at a

855
00:37:44.295 --> 00:37:46.375
business online and then I'd go and visit the business

856
00:37:46.375 --> 00:37:49.175
and I was like, oh no, this is not for me.

857
00:37:49.225 --> 00:37:53.895
Right? Um, so I can't boggles my mind how many people go

858
00:37:53.895 --> 00:37:55.535
through this business buying process without

859
00:37:55.815 --> 00:37:57.775
visiting what they're gonna buy.

860
00:37:57.885 --> 00:38:00.055
Like, until so late in the process.

861
00:38:00.365 --> 00:38:02.215
Like you could feel so much from like,

862
00:38:02.215 --> 00:38:03.535
is this, is this my vibe?

863
00:38:04.075 --> 00:38:06.775
Um, obviously you might not be let into the

864
00:38:06.775 --> 00:38:07.975
house until you're engaged.

865
00:38:08.315 --> 00:38:10.775
You know, a lot of brokers might keep you from this,

866
00:38:10.835 --> 00:38:11.895
so depending on where you're at.

867
00:38:11.955 --> 00:38:15.175
But like, please go do a house visit as soon as you can

868
00:38:15.275 --> 00:38:17.175
before, before you actually get married.

869
00:38:17.875 --> 00:38:20.815
Um, and then there might be some sneaky stalking

870
00:38:21.235 --> 00:38:22.535
or in my case, uh,

871
00:38:22.535 --> 00:38:24.335
my boyfriend did a background check on me,

872
00:38:28.985 --> 00:38:32.255
which I loved because it showed he was really excited about

873
00:38:32.255 --> 00:38:34.215
me and he wanted to make sure there wasn't anything

874
00:38:34.235 --> 00:38:35.245
he was missing, right?

875
00:38:35.505 --> 00:38:38.085
Um, we do that. We go look at somebody's social media

876
00:38:38.125 --> 00:38:40.325
profiles, we scroll all the way to the end

877
00:38:40.385 --> 00:38:42.285
and see like, who did they date,

878
00:38:42.355 --> 00:38:43.725
what have they done, what am I missing?

879
00:38:43.985 --> 00:38:46.165
So you can do this with the businesses too.

880
00:38:46.185 --> 00:38:49.685
You can secret shop or you know, just do your research,

881
00:38:49.785 --> 00:38:53.125
but make sure you do not break NDA confidentiality.

882
00:38:53.455 --> 00:38:55.965
Don't like notify anyone to anything.

883
00:38:56.285 --> 00:38:58.005
'cause this could get you into real trouble here.

884
00:38:58.505 --> 00:39:00.925
But like, see what the experience is like as a customer.

885
00:39:01.855 --> 00:39:03.115
Are they who they say they are?

886
00:39:03.615 --> 00:39:05.755
Is that something that you see your alignment with?

887
00:39:06.375 --> 00:39:08.195
Um, and then before you make the proposal,

888
00:39:08.345 --> 00:39:11.755
consult your circle, um, and your deal team

889
00:39:12.135 --> 00:39:15.475
and your family, um, and check in time.

890
00:39:15.655 --> 00:39:18.115
All right? I'm gonna whistle stop through this.

891
00:39:18.215 --> 00:39:20.115
So you really wanna check with people

892
00:39:20.135 --> 00:39:21.475
before you make this decision

893
00:39:21.575 --> 00:39:23.195
and make sure you're not gonna ruin your life

894
00:39:23.215 --> 00:39:24.475
and get the right people around you,

895
00:39:24.535 --> 00:39:27.155
or if your life is gonna significantly change, have

896
00:39:27.155 --> 00:39:30.795
that conversation with your people, spouse,

897
00:39:30.835 --> 00:39:31.955
family, et cetera.

898
00:39:32.135 --> 00:39:35.035
If it's gonna change, because this can often end up breaking

899
00:39:35.155 --> 00:39:36.475
a deal is that you haven't actually

900
00:39:36.475 --> 00:39:37.595
pictured what it's gonna be like.

901
00:39:37.735 --> 00:39:39.555
And then the last step is proposing.

902
00:39:39.695 --> 00:39:43.715
So that's sending your LOI and it's not the last obviously,

903
00:39:43.855 --> 00:39:45.515
but we're getting to proposal, we're getting

904
00:39:45.515 --> 00:39:49.505
to LOII say all of this

905
00:39:49.535 --> 00:39:52.385
because you don't wanna talk about moving

906
00:39:52.525 --> 00:39:54.385
to get in together on the first date.

907
00:39:54.645 --> 00:39:56.305
I'm sorry this thing keeps popping up

908
00:39:56.325 --> 00:39:58.385
and I don't, it's showing now, um,

909
00:40:01.395 --> 00:40:03.535
if you get on that first coffee date call

910
00:40:03.675 --> 00:40:06.695
and you start asking them why they had a 2% drop in their

911
00:40:06.695 --> 00:40:09.735
margin in 2022, like

912
00:40:10.485 --> 00:40:12.335
it's too much early on, right?

913
00:40:12.395 --> 00:40:13.655
If you have the time, like,

914
00:40:13.655 --> 00:40:15.255
just think about this relationship

915
00:40:15.275 --> 00:40:16.335
and if I was trying

916
00:40:16.335 --> 00:40:18.095
to marry this person, where would I be at?

917
00:40:18.725 --> 00:40:20.575
Show them you're worth the compromise.

918
00:40:20.725 --> 00:40:22.975
Like if you're starting to throw out seller notes

919
00:40:23.155 --> 00:40:24.575
before they even know who you are,

920
00:40:25.155 --> 00:40:27.295
why would they bet their retirement on you

921
00:40:27.795 --> 00:40:29.575
and play the long game, right?

922
00:40:29.585 --> 00:40:32.815
Think about this like a marriage and not a one night stand.

923
00:40:34.455 --> 00:40:38.395
You wanna move from transactional to relational and,

924
00:40:38.495 --> 00:40:40.475
and doing this, this mindset of

925
00:40:40.535 --> 00:40:42.675
how am I treating this relationally rather than

926
00:40:42.675 --> 00:40:45.155
transactionally will change so much for you.

927
00:40:45.495 --> 00:40:47.955
So the first thing is trusting.

928
00:40:49.395 --> 00:40:51.455
You'll see things and you're wanting to catch things

929
00:40:51.455 --> 00:40:53.735
that are wrong, but like, don't make assumptions.

930
00:40:53.785 --> 00:40:56.255
Don't be that person that doesn't trust someone

931
00:40:56.605 --> 00:40:57.855
like you wanna verify.

932
00:40:57.915 --> 00:41:00.655
But I always trust someone until they gimme a reason not to.

933
00:41:00.675 --> 00:41:02.655
And then you're dead to me, right?

934
00:41:03.035 --> 00:41:05.215
But I, I like having an open heart

935
00:41:05.235 --> 00:41:08.495
and just assuming that most people, 99% of people want

936
00:41:08.495 --> 00:41:09.815
to do the right thing and are good people,

937
00:41:10.715 --> 00:41:13.055
you can also show them that you care, right?

938
00:41:13.275 --> 00:41:16.335
Ask them about their story, what's coming next for them.

939
00:41:17.055 --> 00:41:19.535
Actually listen, remember the details that they share.

940
00:41:20.035 --> 00:41:22.895
My favorite thing to do with sellers is, you know,

941
00:41:22.895 --> 00:41:24.455
they know they're getting on the phone with me

942
00:41:24.615 --> 00:41:26.055
to talk about selling their business,

943
00:41:27.075 --> 00:41:28.215
but I'm like, hey, okay,

944
00:41:28.215 --> 00:41:30.975
before we get into that, like tell me the origin story.

945
00:41:31.075 --> 00:41:34.205
How did this all happen? I love hearing it.

946
00:41:34.315 --> 00:41:35.605
They love sharing it.

947
00:41:35.705 --> 00:41:38.085
And these are people that like, have so much experience

948
00:41:38.085 --> 00:41:39.365
and like wild stories.

949
00:41:39.635 --> 00:41:43.365
Like I care. I care about their story, I care about them.

950
00:41:43.985 --> 00:41:45.085
Um, show them that

951
00:41:45.875 --> 00:41:47.975
and go meet them, please for the love of God.

952
00:41:48.035 --> 00:41:52.215
Go meet them in person. Go have human interaction.

953
00:41:52.305 --> 00:41:55.535
Don't hide behind an email thread or your lois.

954
00:41:55.805 --> 00:41:57.655
Like this is when things shift

955
00:41:57.795 --> 00:41:59.455
and you really build that rapport.

956
00:42:00.035 --> 00:42:04.035
So if you're negotiating with them, negotiate in person,

957
00:42:04.585 --> 00:42:06.715
it's much more collaborative when you're like, okay, hey,

958
00:42:06.715 --> 00:42:09.195
let's sit down and have some hard conversations, right?

959
00:42:09.575 --> 00:42:10.955
If you're behind your laptop

960
00:42:11.015 --> 00:42:13.955
or behind your deal team, things are gonna like be

961
00:42:14.905 --> 00:42:15.935
taken outta context.

962
00:42:16.245 --> 00:42:17.815
It's not gonna go well. You're probably

963
00:42:17.835 --> 00:42:18.975
not gonna collaborate.

964
00:42:19.315 --> 00:42:20.655
So this is really important

965
00:42:20.915 --> 00:42:23.415
to have these conversations in person when you can,

966
00:42:23.555 --> 00:42:26.055
you can connect with them and it's far more

967
00:42:26.165 --> 00:42:27.655
effective to do it this way.

968
00:42:29.245 --> 00:42:31.935
Um, and if the like, okay,

969
00:42:32.095 --> 00:42:33.975
I understand broker won't let you meet the seller.

970
00:42:34.005 --> 00:42:35.815
It's competitive. You gotta put an offer in,

971
00:42:36.045 --> 00:42:37.895
send a video cover letter, right?

972
00:42:38.275 --> 00:42:39.615
Do your research on the seller.

973
00:42:39.835 --> 00:42:42.975
Go stock their social media page, find out what they're into

974
00:42:43.075 --> 00:42:44.175
and how you connect to them.

975
00:42:44.605 --> 00:42:46.895
Send them a video cover letter with your LOI

976
00:42:46.895 --> 00:42:48.135
and be like, hi, this is me.

977
00:42:48.275 --> 00:42:49.775
I'm super excited about your business.

978
00:42:49.955 --> 00:42:52.815
You like did something amazing. Here's why.

979
00:42:53.405 --> 00:42:54.815
That can create a connection.

980
00:42:54.815 --> 00:42:57.055
And when our clients have done it in these competitive

981
00:42:57.055 --> 00:43:00.015
situations, it ends up getting them further along

982
00:43:00.015 --> 00:43:01.455
because they appreciate the effort

983
00:43:01.455 --> 00:43:02.735
and they appreciate the connection.

984
00:43:04.755 --> 00:43:08.975
Um, another thing that's like, something I love doing

985
00:43:09.075 --> 00:43:11.255
and I love hearing about is thoughtful gestures.

986
00:43:11.435 --> 00:43:13.415
So I have a friend, um,

987
00:43:13.555 --> 00:43:16.295
who bought a business at a exceptional multiple.

988
00:43:17.275 --> 00:43:18.855
Um, and he wasn't the highest offer,

989
00:43:19.235 --> 00:43:20.815
but he knew the owner liked to golf

990
00:43:20.835 --> 00:43:23.015
and he is like, I'm betting he is probably gonna

991
00:43:23.015 --> 00:43:24.095
wanna do a lot more golfing.

992
00:43:24.175 --> 00:43:26.135
I, and he bought some golf balls

993
00:43:26.595 --> 00:43:28.975
and he got chosen for the golf balls.

994
00:43:29.555 --> 00:43:34.375
Um, when I was on my big deal, I knew that the couple wanted

995
00:43:34.375 --> 00:43:35.695
to travel with their kids more.

996
00:43:35.835 --> 00:43:38.175
So I got them a travel mat, you know,

997
00:43:38.285 --> 00:43:39.735
like doing thoughtful things.

998
00:43:39.765 --> 00:43:41.655
It's like, I hear you. And also, Hey,

999
00:43:41.905 --> 00:43:43.175
don't you wanna be traveling?

1000
00:43:43.435 --> 00:43:46.215
I'm the person that can help you, like go off and travel.

1001
00:43:46.835 --> 00:43:48.535
Um, I had a seller that wanted

1002
00:43:48.535 --> 00:43:50.255
to start an alien themed business,

1003
00:43:50.315 --> 00:43:53.935
so I got him a little alien light, uh, for his new office,

1004
00:43:54.275 --> 00:43:56.935
you know, so these little things, it can cost you like 15,

1005
00:43:56.935 --> 00:43:58.535
20 bucks, but it means a lot.

1006
00:43:59.275 --> 00:44:02.535
Um, and then the really big thing

1007
00:44:02.535 --> 00:44:04.775
that you wanna be thinking about is help them connect

1008
00:44:05.355 --> 00:44:07.295
to their why through you.

1009
00:44:08.045 --> 00:44:09.255
They're really emotional.

1010
00:44:09.635 --> 00:44:11.855
Um, this is a tough process for them.

1011
00:44:12.115 --> 00:44:13.215
How can you be the person

1012
00:44:13.765 --> 00:44:16.735
that is making their next dream possible and,

1013
00:44:16.835 --> 00:44:21.815
and someone that they can see as their successor, right?

1014
00:44:22.115 --> 00:44:23.495
And, and why they're doing this

1015
00:44:23.555 --> 00:44:26.455
and extending why they did all of this in the first place.

1016
00:44:27.715 --> 00:44:30.775
Um, last thing I'll say is consider a therapist. Seriously.

1017
00:44:30.995 --> 00:44:33.085
Like this is one of the most challenging

1018
00:44:33.085 --> 00:44:35.765
and high stakes situations you'll ever

1019
00:44:35.765 --> 00:44:36.925
be in in your entire life.

1020
00:44:36.925 --> 00:44:38.445
And when you're staring down the barrel

1021
00:44:38.505 --> 00:44:40.805
of a multimillion dollar personal guarantee

1022
00:44:41.195 --> 00:44:43.005
that could bankrupt you and lose your house

1023
00:44:43.025 --> 00:44:45.285
and all of these things, you're gonna act weird.

1024
00:44:45.285 --> 00:44:46.525
You're gonna do weird things

1025
00:44:46.525 --> 00:44:48.245
that's gonna test you on another level.

1026
00:44:48.985 --> 00:44:51.325
Um, so don't let that kill your deal.

1027
00:44:51.425 --> 00:44:54.805
And I can't tell you how many people I've seen

1028
00:44:55.115 --> 00:44:57.205
that have an amazing deal in front of 'em

1029
00:44:57.205 --> 00:44:58.565
and this kills the deal.

1030
00:44:59.815 --> 00:45:01.995
I'm a big proponent of therapy. I think it's amazing.

1031
00:45:02.155 --> 00:45:03.235
I have a business therapist.

1032
00:45:03.475 --> 00:45:04.715
'cause tell you what, as a business owner,

1033
00:45:04.715 --> 00:45:05.755
you're gonna be tested too.

1034
00:45:05.855 --> 00:45:07.275
And it's better to take you out

1035
00:45:07.305 --> 00:45:10.755
with somebody than on your people or do something rush.

1036
00:45:12.015 --> 00:45:14.675
You wanna become the right buyer so often you don't need

1037
00:45:14.675 --> 00:45:17.635
to be the highest bidder if you are relational over

1038
00:45:17.705 --> 00:45:20.835
transaction and you connect with the owner

1039
00:45:20.935 --> 00:45:23.915
and the business on a deeper level than just the numbers.

1040
00:45:24.735 --> 00:45:27.315
So that's all I have to share.

1041
00:45:27.695 --> 00:45:29.395
Um, we're gonna open it up for questions.

1042
00:45:29.535 --> 00:45:30.795
Uh, I mentioned, um,

1043
00:45:30.845 --> 00:45:32.795
we're not taking on new clients right now, but,

1044
00:45:32.855 --> 00:45:35.475
and if you wanna check out what we do, um,

1045
00:45:35.495 --> 00:45:37.715
or jump on the wait list, there's a QR code there.

1046
00:45:37.845 --> 00:45:40.875
We're probably not gonna be having new client conversations

1047
00:45:41.005 --> 00:45:42.195
until 2026.

1048
00:45:42.695 --> 00:45:45.235
Um, but I'm happy to answer questions in the meantime.

1049
00:45:45.455 --> 00:45:47.275
So thank you so much. That was fun.

1050
00:45:47.805 --> 00:45:50.555
Thank you Athena. Uh, amazing presentation as always

1051
00:45:50.555 --> 00:45:53.155
that your, your energy is positively infectious.

1052
00:45:53.855 --> 00:45:56.475
Um, and there was just a lot, a lot

1053
00:45:56.475 --> 00:45:57.475
of great material in there.

1054
00:45:58.155 --> 00:46:01.795
Reminder. Well, I don't want to, so I'll the handout

1055
00:46:01.795 --> 00:46:04.355
that people are gonna get Athena, maybe just say, say,

1056
00:46:04.735 --> 00:46:05.955
uh, what that is again.

1057
00:46:07.075 --> 00:46:10.485
Yeah. Um, so will rightly pointed out there's a lot

1058
00:46:10.485 --> 00:46:13.645
of information in there and when you're getting onto a call

1059
00:46:13.645 --> 00:46:15.925
or meeting a seller, like what's the steps

1060
00:46:16.065 --> 00:46:17.365
or things that you need to think about?

1061
00:46:17.505 --> 00:46:20.485
So we're gonna be creating a little checklist, cheat sheet,

1062
00:46:21.065 --> 00:46:24.205
uh, as a takeaway of, okay, I'm getting onto a broker call.

1063
00:46:24.205 --> 00:46:25.845
What do I need to do before, you know,

1064
00:46:25.945 --> 00:46:27.445
I'm about to have the seller meeting.

1065
00:46:27.445 --> 00:46:28.445
What do I need to do before?

1066
00:46:29.025 --> 00:46:32.205
Um, so it'll be, you know, just kind of a light version of

1067
00:46:32.205 --> 00:46:35.885
that, um, of what we work through with our clients,

1068
00:46:35.885 --> 00:46:37.405
getting them ready for those different things.

1069
00:46:37.505 --> 00:46:38.505
So

1070
00:46:38.905 --> 00:46:42.895
Don't forget to ask, is there anything that I'm not asking

1071
00:46:43.965 --> 00:46:45.905
for example, would be one of the things on there.

1072
00:46:45.905 --> 00:46:47.745
Yes. Yeah. Stuff like that. Yes. Great.

1073
00:46:48.005 --> 00:46:49.945
No, I mean, there's just so much in there, Athena.

1074
00:46:49.945 --> 00:46:51.145
It was great. Um, I think this,

1075
00:46:51.215 --> 00:46:53.065
this could be a good distillation for everyone.

1076
00:46:53.125 --> 00:46:55.465
So that will go out, um, Athena

1077
00:46:55.465 --> 00:46:57.145
and her team is gonna give that, to get that to us,

1078
00:46:57.455 --> 00:46:59.345
that the slides in this,

1079
00:46:59.445 --> 00:47:01.425
in this recorded presentation will go out.

1080
00:47:01.685 --> 00:47:04.505
Um, should be before the weekend. Okay.

1081
00:47:04.965 --> 00:47:08.425
Uh, people saying thank you, people saying phenomenal, uh,

1082
00:47:09.025 --> 00:47:10.945
phenomenal presentation here, Athena.

1083
00:47:10.945 --> 00:47:13.105
So we got 10 minutes for some quick questions.

1084
00:47:13.805 --> 00:47:17.605
Um, in a previous episode,

1085
00:47:17.665 --> 00:47:19.365
you talked about the 2%

1086
00:47:19.425 --> 00:47:21.245
who actually succeed in this journey.

1087
00:47:21.315 --> 00:47:23.245
What separates the two from the 98?

1088
00:47:25.475 --> 00:47:28.375
Wow. It is, yeah.

1089
00:47:28.515 --> 00:47:32.805
So, um, I heard this from Dylan, the founder of Baton, um,

1090
00:47:32.975 --> 00:47:35.925
which they're doing amazing things out there, uh, in,

1091
00:47:35.925 --> 00:47:37.565
in the industry and doing things differently.

1092
00:47:38.025 --> 00:47:40.045
And he said that only 2% of people

1093
00:47:40.045 --> 00:47:42.045
that say they wanna buy a business actually do.

1094
00:47:43.115 --> 00:47:46.705
Um, I,

1095
00:47:47.205 --> 00:47:48.505
the same thing was true when I,

1096
00:47:48.585 --> 00:47:51.105
I my background is running startup communities

1097
00:47:51.105 --> 00:47:52.825
and helping a lot of people, you know,

1098
00:47:53.165 --> 00:47:55.625
go from future preneur to entrepreneur.

1099
00:47:56.245 --> 00:48:00.415
Um, the idea of business ownership is,

1100
00:48:00.555 --> 00:48:03.055
is often more attractive than the reality of it.

1101
00:48:03.195 --> 00:48:05.975
So people want what they perceive as freedom,

1102
00:48:06.785 --> 00:48:08.175
which it's not, right?

1103
00:48:08.365 --> 00:48:11.495
Like you have personal guarantee, potential bankruptcy,

1104
00:48:11.795 --> 00:48:13.135
all these people dependent on you.

1105
00:48:13.135 --> 00:48:15.335
That's not freedom. It's flexibility.

1106
00:48:15.595 --> 00:48:19.135
You know, I can decide if, if I wanna, you know, take myself

1107
00:48:19.135 --> 00:48:20.135
to an appointment or not,

1108
00:48:20.135 --> 00:48:21.815
and I don't need to ask anyone permission.

1109
00:48:25.055 --> 00:48:29.105
It is often your resilience and your grit.

1110
00:48:29.605 --> 00:48:31.985
Um, and, and taking action on things

1111
00:48:32.005 --> 00:48:33.665
and pushing through the challenges

1112
00:48:33.735 --> 00:48:35.145
that I think sets you apart.

1113
00:48:35.405 --> 00:48:39.105
So you really deeply need to ask yourself if you are

1114
00:48:39.755 --> 00:48:43.305
crazy enough to take on the sheer amount

1115
00:48:43.305 --> 00:48:44.945
of responsibility it's gonna take

1116
00:48:44.945 --> 00:48:47.665
to do a multimillion dollar loan, take on a business,

1117
00:48:48.735 --> 00:48:51.945
have all those people trust you, the customers,

1118
00:48:51.945 --> 00:48:53.145
the clients and everything.

1119
00:48:53.145 --> 00:48:56.225
And, and most people that I see not move forward

1120
00:48:57.455 --> 00:49:00.155
are the ones that realized, um,

1121
00:49:00.855 --> 00:49:02.835
and maybe they won't say this out loud,

1122
00:49:03.415 --> 00:49:07.715
but the responsibility and the totality of it was too much.

1123
00:49:07.895 --> 00:49:10.195
And actually they had it pretty good in the W2

1124
00:49:10.765 --> 00:49:11.875
where they could, you know,

1125
00:49:11.895 --> 00:49:13.795
get a paycheck delivered to them every week.

1126
00:49:14.095 --> 00:49:16.315
Uh, so I think it's mindset.

1127
00:49:16.675 --> 00:49:18.395
I think it's grit, I think it's resilience.

1128
00:49:18.755 --> 00:49:20.515
I think it's pushing through failure.

1129
00:49:20.835 --> 00:49:24.905
I think it's, you know, if I were to wrap it up, like,

1130
00:49:24.905 --> 00:49:26.385
will you push through the discomfort?

1131
00:49:26.845 --> 00:49:28.225
Are you okay in discomfort?

1132
00:49:28.405 --> 00:49:30.265
And will you take action despite that?

1133
00:49:32.165 --> 00:49:34.045
I think it's, um, it's tricky to answer

1134
00:49:34.045 --> 00:49:37.125
because basically the, there's just so many

1135
00:49:37.715 --> 00:49:38.845
hurdles through the process.

1136
00:49:39.835 --> 00:49:41.085
It's a game of attrition.

1137
00:49:41.185 --> 00:49:43.725
So people are, you know, are constantly falling out,

1138
00:49:43.855 --> 00:49:46.565
would be, buyers are falling out all the way through.

1139
00:49:47.035 --> 00:49:49.605
They might fall out right at the earliest stages when they

1140
00:49:49.755 --> 00:49:52.205
feel like they can't even get themselves to send an LOI

1141
00:49:52.585 --> 00:49:56.485
or somebody might have more, more wherewithal from that

1142
00:49:56.505 --> 00:49:59.765
and get further through into the process, but not that far.

1143
00:49:59.825 --> 00:50:01.525
You know, everyone's got different tolerances

1144
00:50:01.525 --> 00:50:03.005
and different appetites for this journey.

1145
00:50:03.465 --> 00:50:08.005
And so people can go at, at attrition, I dunno

1146
00:50:08.005 --> 00:50:09.085
what the verb for attrition is.

1147
00:50:09.085 --> 00:50:11.325
They can drop out at many different stages.

1148
00:50:11.705 --> 00:50:14.925
Um, but the point is, yeah, that, that it's hard

1149
00:50:14.925 --> 00:50:17.925
and there's just gonna be roadblock after roadblock and,

1150
00:50:17.945 --> 00:50:19.125
And that's normal, right?

1151
00:50:19.515 --> 00:50:22.365
Like it's, it's, it's gonna be hard no matter what you do.

1152
00:50:22.395 --> 00:50:23.805
It's gonna be challenging no matter

1153
00:50:23.805 --> 00:50:26.445
what you do if you're looking for an easy out

1154
00:50:26.665 --> 00:50:28.925
and to buy a business in six months when we've never

1155
00:50:28.925 --> 00:50:30.125
done anything like this before.

1156
00:50:30.125 --> 00:50:33.205
Like, you're not being realistic with the challenges ahead.

1157
00:50:33.755 --> 00:50:36.365
Yeah. And also as you go on this process,

1158
00:50:36.475 --> 00:50:38.605
when you hit those roadblocks, like the,

1159
00:50:38.865 --> 00:50:41.445
you can tell yourself like, oh, the, this the hard, this is

1160
00:50:42.185 --> 00:50:46.525
the hard part that makes this a path that the people

1161
00:50:46.545 --> 00:50:48.645
who do succeed are rewarded for.

1162
00:50:48.675 --> 00:50:51.285
Like, it's like the value is in the hard sadly.

1163
00:50:51.785 --> 00:50:54.765
Uh, but that just is a, probably a good rule of thumb

1164
00:50:54.785 --> 00:50:55.885
for life in all of business.

1165
00:50:57.625 --> 00:51:01.645
Um, Jonathan says very timely.

1166
00:51:01.925 --> 00:51:03.885
I have a big seller meeting in a couple hours

1167
00:51:04.185 --> 00:51:05.565
and this has helped immensely.

1168
00:51:05.745 --> 00:51:07.805
Not a question, just a thank you. So that's cool.

1169
00:51:08.865 --> 00:51:12.645
Uh, you mentioned seven steps prior

1170
00:51:12.645 --> 00:51:13.885
to issuing an LOI,

1171
00:51:13.985 --> 00:51:17.245
but I see multiple sellers sign an LOI within days

1172
00:51:17.265 --> 00:51:18.925
of offers coming in.

1173
00:51:19.745 --> 00:51:22.765
Any thoughts on how to prioritize those steps in a very

1174
00:51:22.765 --> 00:51:24.765
condensed timeframe? Good question.

1175
00:51:25.565 --> 00:51:27.055
Yeah, great question. It's,

1176
00:51:27.125 --> 00:51:29.455
it's absolutely gonna be situational.

1177
00:51:30.275 --> 00:51:32.735
So when a client has a deal

1178
00:51:32.765 --> 00:51:34.575
that they're really excited about, one

1179
00:51:34.575 --> 00:51:35.655
of my first questions is,

1180
00:51:35.675 --> 00:51:37.655
what's the competitive landscape right now?

1181
00:51:38.105 --> 00:51:40.575
Right? Like, checking in with the broker

1182
00:51:40.675 --> 00:51:42.535
or the seller, like, is this hot?

1183
00:51:42.595 --> 00:51:44.975
Are there a lot of offers? In what stage are they at

1184
00:51:45.025 --> 00:51:47.535
where you know, what's going on?

1185
00:51:48.165 --> 00:51:50.615
Some businesses have been on the market for a year

1186
00:51:50.615 --> 00:51:52.735
and they're like, whoa, how did you even find me?

1187
00:51:52.765 --> 00:51:56.095
Like, you know, no one's inquired about this in a long time.

1188
00:51:56.235 --> 00:51:57.455
You know, you're the only buyer.

1189
00:51:57.455 --> 00:52:00.215
You've got some time to do some

1190
00:52:00.215 --> 00:52:02.295
of these things when there's, you know,

1191
00:52:02.735 --> 00:52:03.975
14 offers in the mix.

1192
00:52:04.035 --> 00:52:06.855
And it's all from experience, private equity, et cetera.

1193
00:52:07.435 --> 00:52:10.615
Um, you know, I usually check in

1194
00:52:10.615 --> 00:52:13.135
with the broker about timelines, uh,

1195
00:52:13.315 --> 00:52:17.375
how far along the other offers are, um, what's important

1196
00:52:17.555 --> 00:52:18.775
to the seller.

1197
00:52:19.075 --> 00:52:21.255
So if you don't even get a chance to speak to the seller,

1198
00:52:21.395 --> 00:52:23.655
use the broker and ask them like, what's important to them?

1199
00:52:23.675 --> 00:52:25.775
What's gonna be a winning offer for them?

1200
00:52:25.805 --> 00:52:28.335
What have they not liked and the other offers so far?

1201
00:52:28.915 --> 00:52:31.095
Um, what's your process? What do you wanna see?

1202
00:52:31.395 --> 00:52:34.975
You know, like show up like an ace student, you know, um,

1203
00:52:35.195 --> 00:52:37.935
that's gonna going like ace the test.

1204
00:52:38.555 --> 00:52:40.255
And then that video cover letter I

1205
00:52:40.255 --> 00:52:41.335
think goes a really long way.

1206
00:52:41.755 --> 00:52:44.655
And look, um, I, I tell my clients

1207
00:52:44.655 --> 00:52:47.215
because it's uncomfortable to submit an LOI

1208
00:52:48.125 --> 00:52:49.455
when you haven't met someone,

1209
00:52:49.795 --> 00:52:52.415
but like the very, you get to do due diligence

1210
00:52:52.515 --> 00:52:54.135
and you get to do due diligence.

1211
00:52:54.445 --> 00:52:58.695
Like on the business, once you've signed the LOI you,

1212
00:52:58.955 --> 00:53:01.135
if they haven't let you meet them, that would be weird.

1213
00:53:01.155 --> 00:53:04.535
But usually what I I see happens is like, you submit it,

1214
00:53:04.535 --> 00:53:05.935
they like you and then you, you get

1215
00:53:05.935 --> 00:53:07.255
to start having a conversation.

1216
00:53:07.875 --> 00:53:10.135
Um, so building rapport throughout that conversation,

1217
00:53:10.315 --> 00:53:11.575
you know, and you can be like, Hey,

1218
00:53:11.655 --> 00:53:12.935
I know we're negotiating deals,

1219
00:53:13.075 --> 00:53:15.535
but I saw this thing that your company did.

1220
00:53:15.535 --> 00:53:17.135
It's so cool. Or like, Hey, you know,

1221
00:53:17.155 --> 00:53:19.375
can you tell me a war story while we're going through this?

1222
00:53:19.475 --> 00:53:20.695
You can be playful

1223
00:53:21.395 --> 00:53:24.915
or relational as you're going through something hard.

1224
00:53:25.140 --> 00:53:28.415
So you just need to play the situation

1225
00:53:28.475 --> 00:53:29.535
and see where you're at.

1226
00:53:29.815 --> 00:53:31.975
I think this also comes with experience too.

1227
00:53:31.995 --> 00:53:33.695
The more of these you kind of go through,

1228
00:53:33.795 --> 00:53:36.575
you can get a gauge on how quick do I have to move?

1229
00:53:36.675 --> 00:53:39.695
Do I have to like, try to make a really compelling offer

1230
00:53:39.795 --> 00:53:41.695
and then build the relationship after.

1231
00:53:42.375 --> 00:53:44.175
I don't love when brokers do that,

1232
00:53:44.315 --> 00:53:45.855
but I understand why they do it.

1233
00:53:45.915 --> 00:53:47.975
So it just depends on the situation.

1234
00:53:50.575 --> 00:53:53.405
Great. Couple more here, Athena.

1235
00:53:53.465 --> 00:53:54.685
Um, well, they're a bunch more,

1236
00:53:54.705 --> 00:53:55.885
but we only have time for a couple.

1237
00:53:56.405 --> 00:53:58.045
I love this question. Um,

1238
00:53:58.505 --> 00:54:01.485
if you're a a glass half empty type of guy,

1239
00:54:02.225 --> 00:54:04.645
are you really a good fit to buy a business?

1240
00:54:05.385 --> 00:54:08.605
If so, how do you overcome analysis paralysis in

1241
00:54:08.605 --> 00:54:09.805
looking for all the bad things?

1242
00:54:10.715 --> 00:54:13.245
What I, I love, I've actually thought about this.

1243
00:54:17.225 --> 00:54:18.955
Okay, here's the woo side of me.

1244
00:54:19.055 --> 00:54:21.635
Um, 'cause I, I've had to lean on a lot of woo in my life.

1245
00:54:21.775 --> 00:54:24.545
Um, you could change your mindset

1246
00:54:25.365 --> 00:54:27.505
and you can change your outlook,

1247
00:54:29.525 --> 00:54:32.775
your thoughts become your words become, your actions,

1248
00:54:32.875 --> 00:54:36.855
become your destiny, you know, so that if you change,

1249
00:54:36.955 --> 00:54:38.335
if you catch the thoughts

1250
00:54:38.675 --> 00:54:41.535
and just rewire, um,

1251
00:54:42.585 --> 00:54:45.395
there's a great book called The Big Leap, um,

1252
00:54:45.505 --> 00:54:48.635
that is something that I always tell people to read,

1253
00:54:49.285 --> 00:54:52.075
which is a starter of that your reality is

1254
00:54:52.075 --> 00:54:54.035
of your own making, and depending on

1255
00:54:55.275 --> 00:54:57.015
how much you believe in energy in

1256
00:54:57.015 --> 00:54:58.335
the universe and all of that.

1257
00:54:58.565 --> 00:55:02.295
Like I was just listening to, uh, e squared right now,

1258
00:55:02.755 --> 00:55:06.895
and we see 3 billion pieces

1259
00:55:06.995 --> 00:55:08.535
of information every second.

1260
00:55:09.465 --> 00:55:11.325
You know, we're not taking all that in.

1261
00:55:11.425 --> 00:55:14.325
So if you focus on the bad stuff, what are you gonna see?

1262
00:55:14.325 --> 00:55:15.365
You're gonna see the bad stuff.

1263
00:55:15.465 --> 00:55:16.525
Or we all have that friend

1264
00:55:16.525 --> 00:55:19.685
that they get cheated on in every single relationship.

1265
00:55:20.315 --> 00:55:22.765
Like, that's never happened to me before

1266
00:55:22.765 --> 00:55:24.645
because I don't assume people are gonna cheat.

1267
00:55:24.715 --> 00:55:27.285
They do, right? Like, they start distrusting people

1268
00:55:27.305 --> 00:55:28.365
and think that they're gonna cheat.

1269
00:55:28.865 --> 00:55:31.605
We see those people out there that bad things always happen

1270
00:55:31.605 --> 00:55:34.125
to 'em, and they usually think bad things are gonna happen

1271
00:55:34.125 --> 00:55:35.285
to 'em and they don't trust.

1272
00:55:35.985 --> 00:55:38.965
So there's a lot of great books out there on rewiring your

1273
00:55:38.995 --> 00:55:40.245
mind, changing your mindset.

1274
00:55:41.025 --> 00:55:43.605
Um, and if you only see the glass half full

1275
00:55:43.865 --> 00:55:46.485
and you only see problems without thinking

1276
00:55:46.485 --> 00:55:48.485
through solutions, yeah, I would do some work

1277
00:55:48.485 --> 00:55:49.605
before you buy a business.

1278
00:55:49.845 --> 00:55:52.885
'cause guess what? There's problems every day,

1279
00:55:52.885 --> 00:55:54.245
even when you have a great business.

1280
00:55:54.505 --> 00:55:56.805
And so for me, that's when I go into like,

1281
00:55:56.835 --> 00:55:58.165
okay, there's a problem.

1282
00:55:58.275 --> 00:56:01.045
Like, what's the solution back against the wall brainstorm?

1283
00:56:01.045 --> 00:56:02.325
What are all the things I can do

1284
00:56:02.465 --> 00:56:03.965
to solve this problem right now?

1285
00:56:04.545 --> 00:56:08.525
Um, you know, or I see the, the light at in the solution.

1286
00:56:08.705 --> 00:56:13.525
So, um, the Big Leap is a great book.

1287
00:56:13.865 --> 00:56:16.205
I'm in the middle of E squared, but I really like it.

1288
00:56:16.745 --> 00:56:18.445
Um, or just watch some videos

1289
00:56:18.585 --> 00:56:21.205
and like rewiring your mind for a positive mindset,

1290
00:56:21.425 --> 00:56:23.565
but it, it all starts with how you talk to yourself.

1291
00:56:23.705 --> 00:56:27.165
So, um, you know, therapy is great too.

1292
00:56:27.565 --> 00:56:28.925
I, I'm a big proponent

1293
00:56:28.925 --> 00:56:30.845
of therapy in like every facet of our life.

1294
00:56:31.035 --> 00:56:33.285
When you become a business owner, please get a therapist.

1295
00:56:33.515 --> 00:56:37.005
Like it's gonna test you on every level, um,

1296
00:56:37.105 --> 00:56:39.285
and bring up all this cool stuff that you get

1297
00:56:39.285 --> 00:56:40.885
to like rewire and change.

1298
00:56:40.995 --> 00:56:43.725
It's like, oh, I didn't know my childhood made me like very

1299
00:56:44.685 --> 00:56:47.245
whatever in this situation that came up as a business owner.

1300
00:56:47.465 --> 00:56:50.205
So, um, it's a good question and,

1301
00:56:50.225 --> 00:56:52.925
and it shows me that you have a good level of, um, um,

1302
00:56:52.925 --> 00:56:55.085
self-awareness, which is the start, right?

1303
00:56:55.105 --> 00:56:56.845
So if you see that, hey, this is going on

1304
00:56:56.845 --> 00:56:59.205
with me, do something about it.

1305
00:56:59.345 --> 00:57:01.245
You can, you can absolutely change your

1306
00:57:01.245 --> 00:57:02.445
mindset and how you look at things.

1307
00:57:04.125 --> 00:57:05.305
That's great. Athena, can I,

1308
00:57:05.305 --> 00:57:07.425
can I also share a couple thoughts on this one?

1309
00:57:07.605 --> 00:57:09.145
Yes. Uh, thank you.

1310
00:57:09.725 --> 00:57:14.705
Um, yeah, I, uh, I do, I do think that we all kind

1311
00:57:14.705 --> 00:57:16.985
of assume and are told that you should be an opt, you know,

1312
00:57:16.985 --> 00:57:19.065
entrepreneurs are optimists sort of.

1313
00:57:19.145 --> 00:57:21.385
I, I feel like that's the kind of accepted wisdom.

1314
00:57:22.045 --> 00:57:25.545
Um, I think that that one of the things

1315
00:57:26.175 --> 00:57:29.025
that you should ask yourself is not just am I a pessimist

1316
00:57:29.025 --> 00:57:31.585
or optimist, but if, if you're a, if you're a pessimist,

1317
00:57:32.425 --> 00:57:35.105
I think you also have to ask yourself how you, what,

1318
00:57:35.405 --> 00:57:38.705
how do you behave in bad situ in when things do happen?

1319
00:57:39.545 --> 00:57:40.545
Negative things happen in your life.

1320
00:57:41.005 --> 00:57:42.905
If you're a pessimist and a quitter,

1321
00:57:43.665 --> 00:57:44.705
probably not a good combination.

1322
00:57:44.845 --> 00:57:46.545
Yes, but you can be a pessimist,

1323
00:57:46.925 --> 00:57:50.545
but also a really gritty, persistent person who like,

1324
00:57:50.545 --> 00:57:52.905
when their backs up against the wall pulls, pulls it out.

1325
00:57:53.485 --> 00:57:56.865
So just be, and, and if you're, so, I think, and I,

1326
00:57:56.865 --> 00:57:58.625
and frankly, I think that persist, you know,

1327
00:57:58.625 --> 00:58:00.825
your perseverance, persistence, resilience, et cetera,

1328
00:58:00.825 --> 00:58:03.625
that the, the grit that we hear so much about, we hear about

1329
00:58:03.625 --> 00:58:06.745
for good reason, that I think is the more important thing

1330
00:58:06.745 --> 00:58:09.145
to ask yourself versus are you a pessimist?

1331
00:58:09.145 --> 00:58:12.465
Are you an optimist? Point one, 0.2 is you can really turn,

1332
00:58:12.465 --> 00:58:15.145
especially in this world, you can really turn your pessimism

1333
00:58:15.745 --> 00:58:17.105
a weakness into a strength here

1334
00:58:17.215 --> 00:58:19.785
because you've got a nose for risk.

1335
00:58:19.925 --> 00:58:23.105
You've got, you're naturally inclined to think about

1336
00:58:23.105 --> 00:58:24.465
and talk about risk all day.

1337
00:58:24.845 --> 00:58:27.905
And so you can really stress test these deals, uh, better.

1338
00:58:27.965 --> 00:58:30.905
You, you'll have a, you'll have a better, um, eye for

1339
00:58:30.905 --> 00:58:33.305
where a deal could go bad or a business could go bad.

1340
00:58:33.305 --> 00:58:36.585
That is a real strength as long

1341
00:58:36.605 --> 00:58:38.345
as you not looking for perfection.

1342
00:58:38.365 --> 00:58:40.705
If you're looking for perfection, then stop now.

1343
00:58:40.765 --> 00:58:42.825
But you probably already know that, um, you're,

1344
00:58:42.825 --> 00:58:45.305
you're in this webinar, so you're probably not that.

1345
00:58:45.845 --> 00:58:47.785
Um, so, so I don't think it's,

1346
00:58:47.825 --> 00:58:49.265
I don't think it disqualifies you.

1347
00:58:49.305 --> 00:58:52.105
I think that not being a, uh, grit person

1348
00:58:52.105 --> 00:58:53.745
of grit would disqualify you.

1349
00:58:54.205 --> 00:58:56.425
Um, and I think that you tried to, you know,

1350
00:58:56.735 --> 00:58:58.505
judo this into actual, uh, strength.

1351
00:58:58.605 --> 00:59:00.545
And last point, and then I'll let you stop.

1352
00:59:00.965 --> 00:59:03.225
Um, we interviewed not on acquiring mines,

1353
00:59:03.225 --> 00:59:04.905
but on our sister podcast, the Mines Capital

1354
00:59:04.905 --> 00:59:06.305
podcast, an independent sponsor.

1355
00:59:06.375 --> 00:59:07.465
This guy, a banker

1356
00:59:07.525 --> 00:59:09.705
who did all these independent sponsor deals on this side,

1357
00:59:10.275 --> 00:59:11.745
these incredible returns.

1358
00:59:11.895 --> 00:59:15.385
He's done, bought five platforms, exited for all four,

1359
00:59:15.445 --> 00:59:19.785
he exited for over 10 X-M-O-I-C, ridiculous track record.

1360
00:59:20.325 --> 00:59:23.725
So first question, how did you do this sponsor?

1361
00:59:24.425 --> 00:59:27.365
And one of the big takeaways was he starts with risk.

1362
00:59:27.585 --> 00:59:29.485
He is a very risk averse person.

1363
00:59:29.625 --> 00:59:32.365
He looks at every deal as how can this go badly?

1364
00:59:32.625 --> 00:59:34.525
And I think actually Warren Buffet talks about this.

1365
00:59:35.205 --> 00:59:38.805
D don't f it up. Like, how can, can, like, so it's, uh, he,

1366
00:59:38.985 --> 00:59:42.125
he starts with negativity and then goes from there.

1367
00:59:42.305 --> 00:59:45.205
So I, I don't think it's necessarily the weakness you think

1368
00:59:45.205 --> 00:59:48.865
it is, as long as you don't just never do anything

1369
00:59:48.865 --> 00:59:51.145
because to your question, you're, you're,

1370
00:59:51.145 --> 00:59:52.745
you're paralyzed by analysis.

1371
00:59:54.035 --> 00:59:56.315
I love those points because actually, like, um,

1372
00:59:56.995 --> 01:00:01.395
I don't see risk as negative, you know, like I, I just see

1373
01:00:01.395 --> 01:00:02.755
that as being pragmatic

1374
01:00:03.015 --> 01:00:07.915
and, um, I, one of my weird things,

1375
01:00:08.085 --> 01:00:11.315
right, is I can see a million steps ahead,

1376
01:00:11.395 --> 01:00:14.595
I can see into the future, which is like, it's a positive

1377
01:00:14.595 --> 01:00:16.955
and a negative because I can see everything

1378
01:00:17.115 --> 01:00:20.675
that could possibly go wrong, which some might view

1379
01:00:20.695 --> 01:00:24.195
as pessimism, but like, if I can play a million steps ahead,

1380
01:00:24.195 --> 01:00:25.675
then I can think of all the things I could

1381
01:00:25.675 --> 01:00:26.795
do to account for that.

1382
01:00:27.375 --> 01:00:29.275
Um, was just having a conversation

1383
01:00:30.225 --> 01:00:31.395
with my client last night,

1384
01:00:31.415 --> 01:00:34.595
who has two really great deals in hand, you know,

1385
01:00:34.695 --> 01:00:36.315
and it's like, which one do I choose?

1386
01:00:36.375 --> 01:00:38.395
And I was like, normally it's like kind

1387
01:00:38.395 --> 01:00:39.715
of looking at the upside,

1388
01:00:39.715 --> 01:00:41.435
and both could have potential upside.

1389
01:00:42.355 --> 01:00:45.955
I was like, all right, model it like 20% down

1390
01:00:46.935 --> 01:00:48.195
and sit there and like,

1391
01:00:48.325 --> 01:00:50.555
brainstorm all the things you're gonna do

1392
01:00:51.215 --> 01:00:53.795
if you have a 20% revenue drop.

1393
01:00:54.855 --> 01:00:57.285
Right? And, and how do you feel, like,

1394
01:00:57.345 --> 01:00:59.325
how equipped do you feel to handle

1395
01:00:59.325 --> 01:01:01.005
that in this one or that one?

1396
01:01:01.545 --> 01:01:04.205
And sometimes going into the worst case scenario,

1397
01:01:04.275 --> 01:01:06.805
it's not necessarily being negative, it's, it's,

1398
01:01:06.875 --> 01:01:07.965
it's being responsible

1399
01:01:07.965 --> 01:01:10.005
and it's also thinking like, what am I gonna do about it?

1400
01:01:10.665 --> 01:01:12.245
Um, my team will know this about me.

1401
01:01:12.605 --> 01:01:14.325
Like, I hate people

1402
01:01:14.325 --> 01:01:16.005
that just complain and bring up problems.

1403
01:01:16.075 --> 01:01:19.125
Like, it's a trigger for me, not my kind of vibe at all,

1404
01:01:19.625 --> 01:01:22.405
but I wanna hear, Hey, I'm seeing this.

1405
01:01:22.635 --> 01:01:25.685
It's a challenge. Here's the solution. I'm like, yes, go.

1406
01:01:25.695 --> 01:01:27.525
Let's do it. So like, if you see a problem

1407
01:01:28.145 --> 01:01:30.365
or you see a challenge or you see a flag

1408
01:01:30.385 --> 01:01:32.005
or you thinking like, what's the solution?

1409
01:01:32.025 --> 01:01:33.165
Or how do I handle this?

1410
01:01:37.445 --> 01:01:42.005
Great. Uh, what was the name the,

1411
01:01:42.145 --> 01:01:44.525
the name again that you recommend on Mind Shift?

1412
01:01:44.705 --> 01:01:46.365
Was that Big Leap or was that a different one?

1413
01:01:46.835 --> 01:01:49.485
Yeah, there's a book called The Big Leap by Gay Hendricks.

1414
01:01:49.785 --> 01:01:54.005
Um, I'm reading a book called E Squared right now,

1415
01:01:54.005 --> 01:01:55.005
which I'm really enjoying.

1416
01:01:55.115 --> 01:01:56.525
It's about manifesting stuff.

1417
01:01:56.985 --> 01:02:01.565
Ooh, actually an amazing book that,

1418
01:02:01.945 --> 01:02:05.385
um, this is a fun one.

1419
01:02:06.265 --> 01:02:08.545
I was actually reading this while I was going

1420
01:02:08.545 --> 01:02:12.105
after the $8 million deal and raising $3 million.

1421
01:02:13.205 --> 01:02:17.105
Um, it's called Existential Camp,

1422
01:02:18.775 --> 01:02:23.015
and it's actually about the things that our brain likes

1423
01:02:23.015 --> 01:02:26.775
that we perceive as negative, our existential crisises,

1424
01:02:26.915 --> 01:02:29.495
the things that we like, latch onto these bad things

1425
01:02:29.495 --> 01:02:32.455
that happen in life, and how it's actually like,

1426
01:02:32.875 --> 01:02:34.935
how come people only have like kinks in the bedroom

1427
01:02:35.035 --> 01:02:37.055
for like, weird stuff that would normally be like, painful

1428
01:02:37.555 --> 01:02:40.335
and how we manifest that in life as well.

1429
01:02:40.475 --> 01:02:43.375
And this was transformational for me,

1430
01:02:43.755 --> 01:02:44.895
and I think it, you know,

1431
01:02:45.035 --> 01:02:46.935
in part reading this book while I was going

1432
01:02:46.935 --> 01:02:50.335
after that deal made me get out of my own head to go

1433
01:02:50.335 --> 01:02:52.495
after something that I felt was like insane, right?

1434
01:02:52.495 --> 01:02:54.615
Like, who tries to raise $3 million

1435
01:02:54.845 --> 01:02:56.215
over a Labor Day weekend?

1436
01:02:56.445 --> 01:02:57.735
Like, it was crazy.

1437
01:02:57.875 --> 01:02:59.615
And I was just having so much fun with it.

1438
01:02:59.735 --> 01:03:03.735
I was like, I named the the negative alter ego

1439
01:03:03.735 --> 01:03:06.655
that I had in my life that would normally like, hold me back

1440
01:03:06.655 --> 01:03:07.975
or tell me I couldn't do it.

1441
01:03:08.155 --> 01:03:10.175
So that's a phenomenal read.

1442
01:03:10.445 --> 01:03:12.455
It's, you know, the existential kink

1443
01:03:12.455 --> 01:03:13.815
that we create in our lives.

1444
01:03:14.625 --> 01:03:17.095
Great. What a name. Uh,

1445
01:03:18.675 --> 01:03:19.975
It was a good, good titling.

1446
01:03:20.135 --> 01:03:21.735
'cause you're like, oh, what is that? Yeah.

1447
01:03:21.735 --> 01:03:24.175
Um, and it's, it's actually all about how our mind,

1448
01:03:24.395 --> 01:03:27.095
you know, tends to want the bad things

1449
01:03:27.095 --> 01:03:28.255
that happen to us also.

1450
01:03:28.255 --> 01:03:29.335
Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

1451
01:03:30.355 --> 01:03:33.295
Uh, last question and then we'll wrap it up.

1452
01:03:33.295 --> 01:03:35.455
Everybody just, you mentioned business therapists.

1453
01:03:35.955 --> 01:03:39.255
Uh, are they regular therapists specializing in supporting

1454
01:03:39.455 --> 01:03:40.495
business owners, or is this

1455
01:03:40.495 --> 01:03:41.775
another name for business coaches?

1456
01:03:42.125 --> 01:03:43.125
Good question.

1457
01:03:43.915 --> 01:03:46.295
You know, um, my, my therapist loves that.

1458
01:03:46.295 --> 01:03:47.495
I call her my business therapist.

1459
01:03:47.495 --> 01:03:48.775
It's not, and she's like, I might need

1460
01:03:48.775 --> 01:03:50.255
to like start naming myself that way.

1461
01:03:51.395 --> 01:03:56.335
Um, she, my therapist that I found was,

1462
01:03:56.635 --> 01:03:59.175
you know, trained therapists in all the modalities,

1463
01:03:59.555 --> 01:04:01.095
but also a business coach.

1464
01:04:01.155 --> 01:04:02.575
She liked working with entrepreneurs.

1465
01:04:02.795 --> 01:04:06.575
So she's able to pull in, like, depending on where I'm at,

1466
01:04:06.575 --> 01:04:07.855
sometimes I just need to talk

1467
01:04:07.855 --> 01:04:09.335
through all the stuff happening at work.

1468
01:04:09.425 --> 01:04:11.215
Other times I need to like, sit there

1469
01:04:11.215 --> 01:04:14.375
and do some weird energy clearing thing that she has me do

1470
01:04:14.375 --> 01:04:15.535
that doesn't seem like it works.

1471
01:04:15.595 --> 01:04:17.455
And then all of a sudden I don't have that,

1472
01:04:17.525 --> 01:04:18.575
that issue anymore.

1473
01:04:19.155 --> 01:04:21.335
Um, so she's able to move through modalities,

1474
01:04:21.635 --> 01:04:23.975
but I don't think it's an actual thing out there.

1475
01:04:24.035 --> 01:04:28.575
But what I would say is, you know, a, a, a therapist, a lot

1476
01:04:28.575 --> 01:04:30.695
of people don't choose their therapists in the right way.

1477
01:04:30.805 --> 01:04:32.855
It's very much like, who do I feel comfortable with

1478
01:04:32.875 --> 01:04:36.215
and am I gonna get growth and progress from them?

1479
01:04:36.915 --> 01:04:38.215
Um, so somebody

1480
01:04:38.215 --> 01:04:41.255
that doesn't understand business language is not a good fit

1481
01:04:41.255 --> 01:04:43.055
for me because business is a love language

1482
01:04:43.055 --> 01:04:45.855
and it's all I talk about, you know, friendships as well.

1483
01:04:45.855 --> 01:04:47.535
It's very hard for me to connect

1484
01:04:47.535 --> 01:04:50.255
with someone if I can't talk about business stuff with them.

1485
01:04:50.835 --> 01:04:53.175
So, you know, just finding a therapist

1486
01:04:53.175 --> 01:04:54.735
that you have common ground with,

1487
01:04:55.515 --> 01:04:58.175
or a business coach that maybe has done some,

1488
01:04:58.245 --> 01:04:59.255
some therapy training

1489
01:04:59.275 --> 01:05:01.295
or whatever, they exist out there, you know,

1490
01:05:01.295 --> 01:05:05.605
because the best, you know, uh, performers in the world,

1491
01:05:05.705 --> 01:05:08.605
the, the business folks, they have people like that

1492
01:05:08.635 --> 01:05:10.685
that advise them when they're, they need

1493
01:05:10.835 --> 01:05:12.085
that additional support.

1494
01:05:12.355 --> 01:05:15.965
There's no separation between our trauma and our triggers

1495
01:05:16.065 --> 01:05:18.645
and our emotions and how we show up in business,

1496
01:05:18.695 --> 01:05:21.125
especially when it's incredibly high stakes.

1497
01:05:22.795 --> 01:05:24.665
Great, great stuff, Athena.

1498
01:05:25.015 --> 01:05:27.065
Well, thank you again for a wonderful presentation.

1499
01:05:27.605 --> 01:05:30.345
Um, nobody can match your, your e energy

1500
01:05:30.345 --> 01:05:33.985
and enthusiasm Athena, um, really dense, uh,

1501
01:05:34.965 --> 01:05:37.105
packed, uh, content as well.

1502
01:05:37.295 --> 01:05:40.025
Everybody, you'll get that in your inboxes, uh, by end

1503
01:05:40.025 --> 01:05:42.185
of day tomorrow, including a distillation of all

1504
01:05:42.185 --> 01:05:45.425
that in the form of the checklist and the video itself.

1505
01:05:45.965 --> 01:05:49.345
Um, and by the way, you heard Athena mention her, uh,

1506
01:05:49.375 --> 01:05:51.465
part one, uh, this, this was kind of a part two,

1507
01:05:51.805 --> 01:05:54.145
the part one of the series, which we did a month ago.

1508
01:05:54.405 --> 01:05:57.305
Uh, there's the links, the link to that, so you can go watch

1509
01:05:57.305 --> 01:06:01.185
that and, um, get yourself on Athena's waiting list

1510
01:06:01.185 --> 01:06:03.305
because she's can't, can't help you right now.

1511
01:06:03.315 --> 01:06:06.025
She's, she's booked not, not until probably early part

1512
01:06:06.025 --> 01:06:07.465
of next year, uh, will she be available.

1513
01:06:07.525 --> 01:06:09.105
So start the conversation soon if you're

1514
01:06:09.135 --> 01:06:10.425
serious about working with her.

1515
01:06:11.285 --> 01:06:12.785
And anything else, Athena?

1516
01:06:13.735 --> 01:06:16.395
No, uh, well, I just always want to thank you for

1517
01:06:16.915 --> 01:06:20.155
starting, uh, this, this, you know, amazing

1518
01:06:20.995 --> 01:06:22.035
resource for all of us.

1519
01:06:22.475 --> 01:06:23.635
I have learned a lot from you.

1520
01:06:23.635 --> 01:06:24.875
Everybody learns a lot from you.

1521
01:06:25.175 --> 01:06:28.075
Um, I really appreciate what you're doing for this community

1522
01:06:28.075 --> 01:06:29.075
and telling the real stories

1523
01:06:29.135 --> 01:06:32.555
and giving the real, you know, stuff that will help people.

1524
01:06:32.735 --> 01:06:34.275
So thank you. I know it's a,

1525
01:06:34.555 --> 01:06:37.035
a very hard thing to do on your end.

1526
01:06:37.135 --> 01:06:38.595
So appreciate you and thank you

1527
01:06:38.595 --> 01:06:40.995
for letting me share stuff I'm passionate about in

1528
01:06:40.995 --> 01:06:42.195
my weird and wacky way.

1529
01:06:43.785 --> 01:06:45.875
Very gracious of you. I appreciate that Athena very much.

1530
01:06:45.925 --> 01:06:49.035
Thank you. And thank you everyone for coming.

1531
01:06:49.035 --> 01:06:50.115
Thanks for your attention.

1532
01:06:50.575 --> 01:06:52.395
Uh, thank you Athena Simpson once again.

1533
01:06:52.865 --> 01:06:54.755
This ends the webinar. Bye everyone.
