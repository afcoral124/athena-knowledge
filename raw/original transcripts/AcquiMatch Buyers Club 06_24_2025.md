# AcquiMatch Buyers Club 06/24/2025

[00:00:00] 

**Athena:** Hello. Hello. Welcome. Welcome.

Hello. Hi. Hey Justin, how's it going? 

**Gil:** Hey, it's going well. 

**Athena:** Polly's here too. Awesome. Cool. Um, super excited to hear some updates from y'all. I know you have some, uh, interesting things going on that we're gonna talk through. Um, also, uh, just another plug, I'm gonna plug this. A lot, but Matt Malone from Stone, she, Stonehenge Capital is coming to speak to us on Thursday.

Now Matt is from a private debt lender. They act as a fund. They're also an SBIC, which means they get some SBA support to do investments. But what's really cool about private [00:01:00] debt and uh, these types of capital providers is that there's not typically a personal guarantee. And they do fund larger deal sizes, and it's not the same thing with SBA where you have to come up with 10%, et cetera.

So Matt's gonna be coming on Thursday. He's been, uh, hugely helpful in my own journey. He supported me kind of early on, um, and he's agreed to come on and do a 1 0 1. About private debt, sbs, all the like, who should do this, who shouldn't, all those things. So really would love for y'all to come live. Um, 'cause I think it's something all of you could potentially tap into depending on, uh, the deal.

So he represents one, but there's a lot of these types of capital providers out there as an alternative to SBA financing. So, um, he's awesome here in, uh, Texas. He's in Dallas. Um, so that's gonna be on Thursday on buyer club. Um, so yeah, that's the main update. But I would love to, [00:02:00] um, first check in with Paul.

Did you have a seller meeting today? 

**Polly:** Yes, we did. We had a seller, uh, seller meeting at noon today, and that went very well. Um, the. The, um, opportunity is for three different franchise locations. It was really interesting to get his backstory and just digging into all of this. It's, um. It's so much more than I would've ever thought.

I mean, I'm familiar with, with franchise businesses, but, um, having to review the franchise agreement and also just digging into all of the financial stuff and understanding how the business works. But there are definitely some pluses and you know, to it, um, all their systems that they have in place, um, very.

Strong support systems, very strong infrastructure. So, um, really [00:03:00] liked him. He, uh, super sharp guy, the, the franchisor. And he, I think really just wants to be more involved on the franchisor side, um, in creating more franchise, uh, franchise opportunities, um, around the country, as well as just digging a little bit more into.

Um, developing AI with some of the companies that the, there, so there's a, there's a parent company that has various different brands, um, and I think he's a big part of that, of helping them develop even stronger systems and so forth. So that's really his reason for wanting to sell the three locations that he has.

And, um, really just, I, I don't know if you have any specific questions for me. That's kind of an overview, but we definitely have to do more. We're gonna have to do a couple of different financial models, I think, for [00:04:00] this. And of course we'll bring, you know, we'll talk about that tomorrow with you on our one-on-one meeting, but this is a very different.

This is a very different animal as far as just the whole franchise thing and, and, uh, we said that we never wanted to do that, but I think this is kind of a unique opportunity because these are the, the owner, the owner is really, the franchise will work. So the, these are his three stores and they've done very well.

Um, they're relocating one, but he said that's mainly because it's in kind of an older, uh, industrial area and they're moving it more to a, um, more to a residential area where because this is a kitchen and cabinetry franchise, um, it's, it's gonna be moved to a location that a lot, it'll, it'll get a lot more street traffic.

So 

**Athena:** did you, did you all get a secret shop in by chance? [00:05:00] 

**Polly:** Not yet, actually. Um, Mike, who is the broker, he is going to do an introduction either, either way. He said, I can get you into the locations in, in the Chattanooga area that he actually owns, or I can get you into the ones, um, in Atlanta. So we really wanted to have an opportunity to talk to the owner first.

And just get a better handle on kind of how he got this whole thing started and where he sees himself going and the, you know, and why he wants to sell the business. Uh, the three locations and so forth before we actually went out to see, um. You know, a couple of locations either here or there. But, uh, I can easily do that now and I'm, I'm thinking that I'm just gonna, I'm gonna reach out to my mike, the broker and just ask him if he could maybe have, uh, make that happen for one or two here in Atlanta and I can go and do that either to, you know, probably tomorrow, make time in the [00:06:00] morning to go do that.

**Athena:** Well, so here. You have an opportunity to go in and see like secret, shop it for real, you know? Yeah. So if I were you, I would go into one unannounced, not 

**Polly:** even with a broker. Yeah. Okay. 

**Athena:** Because the broker's probably gonna pick the ones that are doing really well, right? Yeah. And like, know that you're coming.

And, and so it's a different vibe as opposed to going in as a homeowner and seeing what the customer experience is like and being like, oh, are you the owner? You know? So I would almost like Secret Shop it. And also like, you're gonna want to go to those. If you, if you're feeling interested in this, you're gonna want to go to those locations, the actual locations.

Um, so. You said you weren't really sure about franchises before, so what about this one is making you feel like, it sounds like this is interesting enough that y'all wanna keep moving forward on it. 

**Polly:** I think so. I [00:07:00] think anytime, well, at least in my experience in the past, I think systems are incredibly important.

Where you have, I mean, if you're going to have to pay a royalty and you're gonna have to, to pay into the franchise, make sure that franchise is able to support. And it sounds like it is. I mean, you know, it's definitely, we're in the, in the infancy of this, so we have to do some, some more, uh, some more due diligence as far as that is concerned.

Um, but he's a very relatable guy. He's not like your slick salesperson type of guy. He, um, he, uh, went to University of Georgia. He's from here. Uh, and you know, he, he was very forthcoming with all of him, his information, and every question we asked him, he gave a solid answer to, so we felt comfortable with him, which is a big, a big thing right there.

And would, you know, love to probably eventually meet him in person. Yeah. But, um, I, I think [00:08:00] it's just, I think it, it wasn't like he was presenting himself as I. A pushy franchise salesperson. I, I've seen that before. And you know, it, he's, he just doesn't seem like that type of person. I think he really wants to find a good fit for the businesses he current I, the locations he currently owns, I.

And, um, he was very, he, he was very straightened saying that he is so busy right now trying to do a lot of development for the infrastructure with AI and doing all these different things to kinda upgrade the systems they have in place. That he said, I'm not able to really dig in at the local level at, at these locations and, you know, drive more of a motivational.

Um, atmosphere with the, with management, with the design teams and so forth. And, you know, he was [00:09:00] talking about Chamber of Commerce and some of the events around that, and really just, you know, um, becoming more involved in the community and Chamber of Commerce is definitely a way to do that. He also said that for each location.

Um, they have a social media presence on Facebook, but they really need more of one. Um, as far as like putting out content. He said the content doesn't get put out fast enough. And he said, that's me. That's, that's me because I'm pulled, I'm stretched too thin right now. So he said, I, I, I think you know, while this is.

Bringing in strong revenue, it could be a lot more based on just having an owner who can kind of get in there and, and, um, you know, we, we asked him like the success of these other locations that he, that, that, um, other franchise locations in the country. And you know, some of the [00:10:00] biggest successes, and he said some of the biggest SU successes have been not being afraid to go out there and like present the business and more of a one-on-one type setting, which would be more like your networking events and that kind of thing.

And there's management on staff to do that, but. They have to be motivated to do that too and know that, you know, there's an owner behind them, you know, pushing them to do that and even getting involved in some of those. So, um, which is something I'm very familiar with. Right. 

**Athena:** Um, so the moving locations mid sale, did you guys get into that discussion?

**Polly:** Yes. So he said that that actually is, um, in the process now and should be done by the end of August, beginning of September. The reason why they're moving that location, it was just in an industrial space and wanted to move it there to more. Right. 

**Athena:** But like, what [00:11:00] assurances does the new owner get when there's like, like did you guys talk about your, you're selling based on everything at the past location, your moving locations.

You're essentially buying it.

**Polly:** We didn't get into a lot of that. We were on the phone with him for an hour. We covered, covered a lot of, a lot of content, a lot of questions we had. Um, I had Steve had and so forth. But, um, we did not actually get into that. 

**Athena:** That's something for sure, like if, if you move forward in this structuring, I would want see some protections around, um, like either performance notes or something like that, that this new location needs to perform.

At least at the level it did at the previous location. Otherwise, like that portion of, and you'll be able to like look at revenue per location, right? But that to me is such a, such a wild card. They're like, oh, it's gonna be better. And like, what if it isn't? You know? [00:12:00] And it's like establishing a new brand and that whole thing.

So that's, that's the thing that jumped out at me when we were speaking. Is this new location move, so like maybe it is better for you and if he's that confident that it's gonna be better than the other location, then attaching, you know, performance to that location's revenue shouldn't be a problem. But that, that's the one that makes me nervous at this point.

What are y'all seeing as the next steps? 

**Polly:** I think the next step is going to be, you know, Steve and I sitting down getting any of our other questions answered, um, which he said he'd be happy though, and said he'd be happy to jump on another call with us. Um, and so to the broker, if there's anything that he can do to answer those questions, um, that he'd be glad to do that as well.

So. I think we need to get whatever questions that we feel we didn't get answered today. And this one that you brought to the table, which is really important. I'm going to see [00:13:00] Secret Shop, the location here in Atlanta, one, maybe two. And then, um, I. We need to talk about some creative financing too, I think as well.

So, uh, the, the other, there was one location that they have that, um, the lease is up for renegotiation, but he said that that's. They're just gonna resign. It's, it, it's been, you know, it's, it's done very well for them. And, uh, he said it'll be another 10 year lease. So, 

**Athena:** yeah, that'll definitely need to be in place with a, with SBA.

So, um, did you get a sense from the broker on, um, what he sees as next steps and what, if any, competition there is? I haven't talked, I haven't 

**Polly:** talked to the broker since we talked to the owner, but, um, I reached out by email and just, I, I just asked him, I said, you know, really enjoyed the, the [00:14:00] time with, uh, with, uh.

Uh, with him today as far as talking, both with both of them, but really he just facilitated it and let us talk with the owner. So I said I really enjoyed our time with Casey and, and learned a lot. Um, what, what do you see are the next steps? I mean, he had said that they had an IOI and as of last week, they had, they had one LOI and one that was supposed to come in like at the end of the week.

So I am trying to gauge that because I think it's just gonna be an LOI just move forward with the LOI. I think that that's probably, he's gonna say that that's the next step. 

**Athena:** Okay. Um, how, on a scale of one to 10, how excited are you about this one? 

**Polly:** I would say you can't use, you can't use 

**Athena:** seven. 

**Polly:** I would say that on a scale from one to 10, it would probably be an eight right now.

[00:15:00] Okay, great. 

**Athena:** Okay, so we wanna be a little aggressive on this one. So what I would say is get your questions together, but also start doing like get all the numbers into the model and then we can work on that tomorrow. To start. At least you can have an offer ready to go. Go do a secret shop, get your questions answered, and then you're not doing all of that and then getting the offer together.

Mm-hmm. You can start looking at different ways of what might the structuring look like and the financing, and we can do that tomorrow. Um. Do you have a revenue by location breakdown? Yes. 

**Polly:** Yes. 

**Athena:** Okay. So we can then like assign a performance note, um, to the lo the new location one potentially, um, when we do the structuring.

So if you can, if you've got time before tomorrow, I would drop all the financial statements into the model. So then we can work around us or even have a stab at like doing the deal structure [00:16:00] yourself, and then we can work through that tomorrow so that you have an idea of what your offer would be if, if the secret shop and the questions being answered makes you happy enough to do that.

**Polly:** Mm-hmm. 

**Athena:** Okay. 

**Polly:** And uh, yeah, that sounds good. Steve, do you have anything to add to that? I don't, I don't know how, I don't know when you got in on this meeting. 

**Steve:** I've been on for about a minute and a half, so I have no idea what you said, so whatever you say, we're good. 

**Athena:** Hey, Steve.

Awesome. Cool. Well, we'll, we'll catch up on that tomorrow, but that's exciting. It sounds, it sounds really interesting. 

**Polly:** It is interesting. So 

**Athena:** I'll be, I'll be super keen to hear what the experience is like when you go do a secret shop. You know, like go in as a couple, wanting to do a remodel and just see what it's like and like, you know.

Yeah. You and Steve are such, such curious people. You can ask them questions and just like get an idea of like, is this, you know, what does this feel like on the [00:17:00] receiving end of it? Do we like this? You know. 

**Steve:** Well, we want, we, we engaged poly. Steve hates shopping. So,

**Athena:** but that, that, I feel like that's what men typically do when you like, you know, go to Homewares or something. They're like, let's get technical, let's talk finance. Like, what's, how does this actually all work? You know? 

**Steve:** If Amazon could deliver me a kitchen in two days, I'd take it. So, yeah, 

**Polly:** and the good thing is, is I actually had an experience with a company similar to this.

Um, when we did our kitchen remodel in our old house, so I know the kinds of questions I asked, 

**Gil:** right? And 

**Polly:** I know what, you know, I, I, I remember it very, very well. So, as far as, you know, going in secret shopping, it, it'll be pretty easy just because I already went through that experience and what I expected.

What I got, I got a great level of customer service. I mean, [00:18:00] the whole thing went off without a hitch and it was amazing. I know not every project goes that way, but I was actually, um, wrote them a review, which I don't do very often, but I wrote them a review, so this was, you know, not, not this company, but I do remember it very well.

So I can kind of walk in there and, you know, 

**Athena:** well, yeah, you have a benchmark. 

**Polly:** Experience. 

**Athena:** Experience, a personal experience where you had a really good experience and seeing if it feels like it, it has the potential to be the same. Yeah. Like if you get, uh, the broker, Mike was his name. Is that what you said?

Yeah. Mm-hmm. If you get Mike to set up a like. In person with one, then you can pick the one he didn't introduce you to. Right? Yeah. Yeah. And see, like, just go do a secret chop and see what it's like. Um, yeah. But cool. Okay. Awesome. Well, I'm excited to keep dive into this deeper tomorrow. Nice job. Thanks. All right.

[00:19:00] Cool. Uh, Justin, I know you got a couple going on, but I'm, I'm on. Uh, like, I'm super excited to hear if there's any hometown roofing updates, and I know there's two others that you're potentially looking at now too. Yeah. 

**Justin:** Uh, actually I gotta hop in three minutes 'cause I just got noticed that the broker for Hometown wants to talk.

Um, 

**Athena:** yay. That's good. 

**Justin:** So yeah, I mean, yes, they've got, they got, uh, the two I, I created two versions of an LOI, uh, basically following kind of what you and I talked about most recently. And he said the, the text was the seller has pushback. So we're gonna, we're gonna hop on the line to figure out what that is.

Uh, but I'll know more. Actually after today, um, is my guess at least directionally. Um, and then, uh, yeah, and then I'm talking with, um, the broker, the newest opportunity that, uh, Luke sent the writeup for. I'm talking with the broker for that this afternoon and he said he is gonna [00:20:00] present a couple opportunities in front of me, so maybe I'll get a bonus opportunity, whatever.

We'll see what that is. Okay.

So chatting with him about that and then also following up on one of the, uh, the, with the broker for another opportunity for the fencing company. Yeah. And that we're talking, uh, today. I've met with the sellers twice now. Um, 

**Athena:** great. Wow. Twice already. Okay. 'cause that's what we were waiting for the update on.

It sounded like there was a seller. Yeah. 

**Justin:** Yeah. With twice, I mean half an hour each. The brokers like he schedules.

I'm not getting a lot of like intel out because they, they're so colorful and very verbose and that's great. And I let 'em do the talking. The problem is I'm not getting enough juice out of that chat each time, so I'm having to like, all right, like I could do another hour, you know, and answer, get more questions.

So I'm trying to work with the broker to, you know. Sidebar with some [00:21:00] questions that he can answer or get on my behalf to kind of keep this moving forward. 'cause they said they're starting to get a lot of interest. Uh, they're, they've got a couple Lois already on the table. They're thinking about instituting a an LOI deadline.

Um, but so he said the sooner the better just to kind of keep you top of, of the pile basically, and, and top of mind for them. So I'm trying to move as quickly as they'll let me, with the intel that I need to leverage to kind of put together an offer effectively, or an LOI or something. Right. Um. But I'm gonna chat with him, uh, the broker and I have an informal call this afternoon to recap the seller's call that he facilitated yesterday and just get my thoughts and, and that kind of thing.

And, um, so we'll, we'll see what he says there. 

**Athena:** Can you push for an in person? 

**Justin:** I have. I tried. Yeah, because they're down the street from me and, uh, he's, I think he's guarding this a little, this a brokers playing kind of. I, I do, 

**Athena:** I I play dumb on the cellar calls. I'm like, I'm only down the street we could meet [00:22:00] up.

**Justin:** That's literally what I did. And he, he jumped in like a guard dog. Like, because I was like, Hey, I'd love to shake your hand, meet you. I'm right down the street when I had the cellars on the line. Uh, and he goes, oh, well, well, let me, I, I'll kind of handle all of that conversation. You know, he, I was like, all right.

Okay. So, uh, he was very protective of his clients, but, uh, so I tried, but looks like it was a no-go on this one. 

**Athena:** Okay. So in terms of the, I know you gotta jump in one minute for this call. We can pick up with everything tomorrow, but whatever the pushbacks are, um. I know you do a lot of negotiating, but don't feel like you need to make any promises on the call.

Just like, oh yeah, I'll calm down and then we can talk about it and also sit with it afterwards. 

**Justin:** I think that's the move, and I keep thinking what Elliot said, which is awesome. I reached out to him on LinkedIn and I said, dude, that was awesome. I'm sorry I missed it live. He is like, okay, well call me when you need QB.

You know? Good dude. And sent me some more resources and whatnot. But I was thinking what he was saying around negotiation. [00:23:00] It's just like, let them sit with the fact that you have questions, not necessarily that you've got an angle to answer it yet. Right. And let them stew on that. Yeah. So that's kind of what I wanna do, is just hear out the pushback, like the concerns, and then say, okay, let me think it through, you know, and then take a beat.

I would 

**Athena:** like push for what's important too. Like if he wants everything changed. Be like if you were to rank this, right, like what would be 

**Justin:** prioritized. Yeah. What's 

**Athena:** important to you and then, and then you and I can troubleshoot or problem solve or come up with some solutions to like hit that. If we know what's most important to him, like if you were to bring cash at close time in the business, like cash overall.

Whatever. Yeah. Make sure that they understand the overall amount too with that. Like, I know you put I did, I sent that, 

**Justin:** that snapshot total that we created. Yeah. Uh, for the broker so that he could relay and that helped the broker was what Claudia was like, oh, this is good. This is helpful. Because even he was like, oh, wow, he, there's a lot more on the table over the life of this partnership effectively.

Um, and [00:24:00] so he, he knows that. I think it's now just like helping. You know, paint that narrative with the, uh, with the seller and then, you know, get those priorities. But I, I've asked the seller directly a number of ways, like, what's the most important, you know, like, how do you, you know, do you want just all the cash up front?

Do you want like a 

**Athena:** share 

**Justin:** an upside? You're, you're running late, 

**Athena:** so we should have, 

**Justin:** he's, he's gonna call me. I've got my phone. Um, but I'll, I'll hop in a minute anyway, just to call him, but, uh, yeah, so that's, that's where he sits. So I, I have asked, and every time it's like, well, it's all important. It's all, yeah.

Okay. Well, of course it's all important. You want all the money, you want. No downside. You want, you know, smallest seller, you know, component possible. I mean, obviously he wants the.

Paint a more realistic picture with him. So we'll see. We'll see. I'll see what he says. 

**Athena:** Amazing. Cool. I'm excited. Okay, cool. We'll, uh, we'll let you, that, we'll catch that tomorrow and [00:25:00] I'm excited to hear how it goes tomorrow. 

**Justin:** Alright, thanks. Talk soon. Thanks 

**Athena:** Justin. Bye. Awesome. Okay, Gil, I think you had a burger call recently too.

**Gil:** I had a call and a seller call. 

**Athena:** Amazing. Cool. So this is a IT services business? 

**Gil:** Uh, that was the broker call. 

**Athena:** Okay. 

**Gil:** Uh, the protocol went well. Um, he couldn't answer a few questions that I had, so I sent him them an email. He said the last, there's, there's this whole fact that's being built out with, with all the questions.

Uh, so he's gonna add it to the fact, and he is gonna, he's gonna get me the answers. Uh, and I also asked for p and ls, uh, so I can model this out. But basically he said that he's not scheduling, uh, seller calls until he has an IOI. Okay. So he is collecting iis and then, um, he'll, he'll take it from there. So I need to put, and I don't wanna come up with an IOI without, without even looking at the p and ls first.

[00:26:00] So he said I'll give them, he'll get them to me. That was yesterday morning. Uh, I have my calendar to p him tomorrow morning, uh, if I don't get them today. Uh, and we'll follow up with them from there. But the business itself looks really, really great, um, on paper and. What they do is I, I, I know exactly what they do because I've been on the, I've been on the receiving end of that.

Okay. Um, and also also on, on, on the other end. But, uh, I know in my mind how to expand the services that, that they, that they provide. Um, there, there's a lot pentacle that they can push through that, that they can, uh, expand in. So it looks interesting. Um, but again, it is with generational, so there's no price.

**Athena:** Right. Different broker though. 

**Gil:** Different broker. 

**Athena:** Yeah. We blacklisted that one. There's no way.

**Gil:** So yeah, that's, that, that was the broker call. That went well. Um, [00:27:00] and now I'm looking at, wait, I'm, I'm basically waiting on him to get back to me. 

**Athena:** Okay. And you said you had a seller call also? 

**Gil:** Oh, with the landscaping business. 

**Athena:** With the which one? 

**Gil:** Landscaping. Okay. 

**Athena:** Okay. Okay. How's that going? 

**Gil:** That was actually really funny.

Um, they do, did they, we started the conversation and I was asking questions and I think they felt very good with me because they started pouring their heart out, their heart out, and they started saying how much money they do on the table. Yeah. And he started saying he start bragging. I used to walk my kids home from school with bags, some cash in my hand.

Um, so they don't really have books. They don't really, they, and it is not a serious business. I don't think that, uh, I can sequence teeth into, uh, every single thing they do is subcontracted. Yeah. Except for one type of small mystery work that they, that, that they have two [00:28:00] employees for. So they can't really stand behind their work.

Um, it's, it's, it's a no go. I'm gonna, I was gonna talk to you about it tomorrow, but I wanted to email the broker, the broker and say thank you, but no thank you. 

**Athena:** Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, good. Uh, I'd love to hear more details. So, um, I, I've seen exceptional subcontractor businesses before. So was it like, when you say they can't stand behind the work, were you concerned.

That they don't have employees themselves or like, talk me through the subcontractor concerns. 

**Gil:** Um, I have to put my name in front of somebody else's work, right? And I'm new to the business and I don't know how they work and I don't know who the competition is, and I really don't know what's a good job versus a bad job.

Uh, and the learning curve basically based only on subcontractors is too, is too steep, I think. But the whole, the fact that this [00:29:00] is, uh, uh, off the books business, um, is basically pulling me off of it, 

**Athena:** right? So the fact that there's even more cash than what's reported. 

**Gil:** Uh, yeah, I don't know. The, the, the, the, the, the p and l that he supplied in the sim was a two line.

Uh, I, I, I don't, I don't, I don't think he can, I don't, I don't think they can, uh, produce p and l Steven. Right. Okay. I don't think they can, because I think if they could, they put them in, they, they put them in the, uh, in the p and l section of the sim where he put two line items. 

**Athena:** Yeah. Did you, um, did you bring that up at the broker at all or no?

Did you, you went straight to seller call. Okay. 

**Gil:** He arranged for a seller call right away, 

**Athena:** right. Um, yeah. I mean, like the, the. Upside of a business like this is like if the tax returns match the very light p and ls and they're reporting something and they, you can only pay [00:30:00] based on what they reported. So then if there is genuinely all that extra cash there, then it ends up being a whole bunch of bonus cash.

You know, this can happen with businesses where there's a lot of cash transactions. It's like, well, whatever they reported is how you value the business. But you can get a whole bunch of upside when you get in there. Because there, there is a whole bunch that they just couldn't substantiate. You know? 

**Gil:** It's also the fact that, uh, they keep a lot of the gear in their own garage.

**Athena:** Uhhuh, so I'll the new storage 

**Gil:** facility and Right. Yeah. It, it, it, the, the deep, I got the messier already got, um, and. Uh, I had this other deal in my mind as well that, that, that I, that, that I was more excited about. So it kind of, it kind of pushed me off that one. But, uh, I, I, we can talk about it tomorrow, but I, I don't, I don't, I don't feel this one that much.

Uh, I'm, I'm worried about the off book stuff. 

**Athena:** Yeah. Okay. [00:31:00] Um, what specifically worries you about it? 

**Gil:** I don't wanna be walking around with bags of cash. Uh, you know, they don't credit cards, they take only checks, some cash. And these are jobs that, uh, the smallest job is about $20,000. Um, and then they go up from there.

Uh, it's just, it in my mind, it sounds like a mop. Like, like, like a m front. You know, I, I, I don't know. Um, when I think cash business, that's what I think. 

**Athena:** Where, so is it residential or commercial? 

**Gil:** It's purely residential. 

**Athena:** So, so are they just not taking cards and digital payments? 

**Gil:** They don't think, they don't, they don't take control payments?

Don't take cards. Only cash. 

**Athena:** Why is that? 

**Gil:** They don't wanna pay the fee 

**Athena:** Uhhuh. So there's. An opportunity to make it even easier for their customers to accept [00:32:00] different payments if they're not doing that. 

**Gil:** Yeah, maybe. 

**Athena:** Yeah. I don't know. I don't know. I mean, like, I understand what you're saying, but when I hear something like this, if they're reporting something, you know, to, if they're, they're valu, their asking price is based on what they've reported.

Then it means that when you take over the business, you have the potential to make considerably more money than what what you paid based on. Does that make sense? So like, let's say the reporting, they made a hundred thousand dollars. But they actually made 300,000, but you're only paying on the a hundred thousand because that's the only thing that could be substantiated with an SBA loan.

Like they don't have proof of this additional cash. So you pay, I don't know, two x or three x on the hundred K and you're paying like two, $300,000 for a business [00:33:00] that's actually earning. You know, 300,000. Yeah. Then you just like, it's a whole bunch of additional upside just by you modernizing the payment technology and like you'll have to pay taxes on that and stuff like that.

But I would be curious maybe as a learning exercise to see if you can get access to the tax returns just to see what they're reporting. 

**Gil:** They, uh, they were part of the sim. They were, they were in the sim. 

**Athena:** They were, okay, so, so the broker would only be putting numbers based on the tax returns then, which means if there's more cash than what's on the tax returns, then that's just like bonus money potential.

**Gil:** Right. I didn't think about it that way. 

**Athena:** Yeah, because like you can only pay the SBA will only fund based on what's on the tax returns, what they report. So if there's a whole bunch of reported income, that's a whole bunch of extra money that you could potentially make and then serve all those customers [00:34:00] better by accepting card payments and creating subscriptions.

We were talking about that, right? Like if I need my lawn done. I want Milan done regularly and I don't wanna have to like call up or write a check or get cash out. Nobody carries cash. But an email done, they, 

**Gil:** they haven't done landscaping in over two years. They haven't What? Done landscaping in over two years.

Um, okay. They don't do store removal. They, the only thing they do is masonry work. Mm-hmm. That's the only, that's the only, the only only thing they've been doing for the past two, two and a half years, so, right. 

**Athena:** So they're going to somebody's home doing some stone work for them and saying, can you pay me in cash or check?

**Gil:** Yep. 

**Athena:** And when's the last time you've paid cash or check for anything? 

**Gil:** Uh, apparently when I had makes every work done. 

**Athena:** But like, do you see the opportunity there to like service these customers that much better? It's like, [00:35:00] Hey, I'm gonna send you a digital invoice and you can choose any payment type you want.

**Gil:** Yeah. 

**Athena:** So like those, when we're looking at these older businesses that are just, you know, cash cows and they have it modernized because they're like, I don't want to pay a 3% fee. And it's like, well, how much more could you make if you paid a 3% fee? Yeah. Just the cost of business. Right. You know, the 3%, like credit card fee, that, so, um.

Not, you're fully, fully within your right to walk away from this. I'm just showing you a different, different way that I look at these types of businesses. Like you can only pay based on what they've reported, but if they under reported, then it's just, it's just bonus money. You can't, when you take over the 

**Gil:** business about not wanting, not not reporting money, there's something fishy about that.

There's something fishy about the people that actually do that, that, that they hide money from the IRS. There's something, something just doesn't smell right when you do that. You know, maybe they have under the [00:36:00] table payments, they're subcontractors. Maybe, you know, maybe it's a whole, it's a whole thing.

And I don't know. Um, it just, it just sounds, it put me off, let's put it that 

**Athena:** way. I gotcha. Yeah. Um, did, did the owner give you other feelings? Like he was out of an, like, how did you feel? What was your. Spidey sense telling you about him as a person? 

**Gil:** Um, I had a semi hard time understanding him a lot of the times, Uhhuh, because he gets a heavy accent.

Okay. He's European somewhere. I'm not really sure. Um, but he, he's, uh. He's a hard, he's a hardworking guy. You know, he just, he works with his hands. He worked with his hands his whole life, and now he supervises other subcontractors. He makes more money that way. He's, he's a hard worker. Um, that's what he does.

**Athena:** Yeah. [00:37:00] Um, Eastern Europeans are pretty distrusting of.

So it might just be a cultural thing rather than an integrity. But I, I hear what you're saying. You know, so, um, but good, I, I like that you went through to owner meeting. We're, we're actually like gonna be really recommending this to all of you. On every deal to try to get through to an owner meeting because as you just discovered, you learn so much more about a business through the owner.

Either I like it more or whoa, like you're doing this stuff in your garage. You're charging cash or carrying around. Suitcases of cash with your son from school, you know? Um, so it's a, it's a good learning experience either way to just like get through to the owner and have the conversations with the owner to learn about the business.

So, um, well done for doing that. Um, okay. So back to the other one that [00:38:00] you're really excited about. Yeah. Um, where are you at with that? What's stopping you from getting an IOI together? 

**Gil:** So. I was gonna ask you this, uh, tomorrow, but I'm gonna ask you now, do I base an IOI on the sim or do I wait for the p and ls to come my way and then model it and, and do a financial model for it and see how much I actually wanna offer?

How much, how, how much does this business actually work to me? 

**Athena:** Mm-hmm. So in this sim, do you have at the very least, like revenue cogs, expenses, add backs? 

**Gil:** Some stuff. I, I, I, I don't have, uh, a full-blown, uh, p and l. Right. Do you, do you have those I have a few sections of, of a p and l spread throughout the sim 

**Athena:** uhhuh.

Do you think you could piece together the numbers in a, in our modeling template from what's in the sim? 

**Gil:** Um, I, I thought about that. I can try to do that, but [00:39:00] I think they use also different terminology there, so I'm not really sure if it is. Uh, for example, hold on, let, let, let me open this up. Um, no file.

Uh,

where is it? Uh, I can't find it now. Of course, I can't find it now. Okay. Is is, for example, uh, they have here, so that total sales, is that total revenue? Yes. Okay. So these are things that I, I, I don't know. Um, and then they have a few other things here. Uh, I I, I can try to piece it together. Um, 

**Athena:** well, we, I, I think it's, it's helpful for everybody, right?

'cause there's different terms. So just read the terms off and then, um, then I'm, I'm gonna like assign you some homework for tomorrow to try to put what you can in there and then at least we can start working up what an IOI might look like while you're waiting for those po. P and [00:40:00] Ls to come through.

**Gil:** Total sales. Cost of sales. Is that cogs? 

**Athena:** Yep. 

**Gil:** Uh, gross profit operating expenses. Uh, depreciation. There's just number two here. Um, that income ebitda. Uh, then there goes into another sheet that has, uh, assets and liabilities. Um, it's a balance sheet basically. Yep. Um, I don't know how to translate the balance sheet into our model.

**Athena:** You don't need the balance sheet right now. So, um, I would just use so that you, you have enough to, to at least put in the financials. So total sales will be the same as revenue. Cost of sales will be the same as cost of goods, and then operating expenses will also be, you know, there's another section there for operating expenses, so you can see what net income is.

Um, if they haven't [00:41:00] broken out the what, what they totaled the EBITDA on, then we. Like if they didn't say like, this is how much interest or, you know, whatever is, um, and then, uh, depreciation, that sort of thing, then we can just put a lump sum number to get to their EBITDA number. So I would say like, start at least putting those numbers where you think they go into the model and then tomorrow we can pull it up side by side and just compare and see if we can, what you wanna try to do is get the numbers in the model of those different sections to match.

What they're showing in the sim so that while you're waiting for the p and ls, if, if those numbers actually do come correct, then we can start wrapping our heads around what a deal structure might look like for it. Because it sounds like, uh, there's, there's a lot of interest in this and you said it looks really good and you're really excited about it, right?

So other people might be, so we need to work a little fast on this one. 

**Gil:** Yeah, [00:42:00] he says he is, uh, accepting IIS until the first or second week of July, so 

**Athena:** Oh, great. Okay. So, and he is not letting anyone meet the owners until, 

**Gil:** until he has iis and then decide who And, and then, and then they'll, they'll do a few.

**Athena:** Huh. So if you submit an io, I will he give you an owner meeting before then, or he's waiting until he gets all the 

**Gil:** DOIs? I. 

**Athena:** Um, okay. Well we can, we can think of some strategies to maybe try to get in there earlier. Um, a lot of people, Pauly and Steve included, are having great luck with sending videos. I think you've sent a video before too, so maybe just send that along with the IOI.

But we'll, we'll talk about, um, that tomorrow. I'd say if you can, before our meeting start, drop in what numbers you can make out from the sim into the financial model. Yeah. Um, 'cause a lot of times the, like, if other people are making offers. On the [00:43:00] business without the financial statements that you're asking for.

If you're waiting for the financial statements to come and there's a lot of interest in the deal, you can sometimes lose the opportunity based on that. So, you know, when we're submitting an IOI, it's literally like, okay, well this is what I'm thinking. But it's, it's a meaningless number as far as I'm concerned.

They're just wanting to see like, that you're somewhere in the range, you know, or see who's willing to offer them a so you can be a little aggressive with the IOI and then when they give you more information to be able to put an LOI together, then you might adjust it from there. But an IOI is, there's no binding, there's nothing signed.

It's, it's putting an offer out there. What we might wanna do, and we'll dig into this a little bit deeper. It's just hit 'em with an LOI instead of an IOI. Um, and see what that does. 'cause that shows a little bit more seriousness. So, um, for the benefit of everyone here or watching. [00:44:00] When there's a lot of competition in the mix, the brokers doing this, IOI thing will sometimes use it to like, you know, play off each other, but an LOI has an expiry date on it and shows you're serious.

So it's like, hey, I'm putting an LOI together, or I'm submitting an offer. Here's my expiry date on it. Has all your terms in there already. It depends on how much information you have and how excited you are about the business, if you wanna do that in absence of meeting the seller. But again, you know, what we're trying to do is kind of beat out the competition at this point with the information that we have available so that you can get the information that you need to make a decision on whether you wanna buy the business.

**Gil:** Is it a wise decision to submit an L LOI without talking to the owner? 

**Athena:** It's not my favorite situation, but again, LOI is non-binding, right? So you've already done an LOI. You don't need to like pay any money. You have a template, like [00:45:00] you can put it together and just say, okay, it's not ideal. I'd really like to meet the owner, but if everything checks out the way that you're saying it is, and I like the owner, here's what I think I'm willing to pay.

So I don't think the brokers do anyone any. Um, any benefit by like, you not being able to establish that relationship, but obviously the very first thing you're gonna want to do if your LOI gets accepted is meet the owner. 

**Gil:** Yeah. 

**Athena:** And then if you meet the owner and you're like, I don't like this. So the LOI.

Um, you know, it gets you under exclusivity and then you take as long as you need to get comfortable with the deal. That's the whole point of diligence. So it just extends the diligence period because you weren't able to do that upfront. So it's not my favorite, but if you really like the deal, the numbers look good.

Like you said, this is an industry you are very familiar with, and you see it as something that you could, you know, grow and expand going forward, then you [00:46:00] might just need to play this part a little bit differently just to get. To the next step. 

**Gil:** Yeah. Okay. 

**Athena:** So just remember the LOI is like, the only thing binding about it is the exclusivity, uh, the, you know, indemnification, like just the legal things, but it doesn't make you buy the business.

You don't have to buy it at that amount, and they didn't give you any information, so you're just making an offer based on the limited information you have. So, LOI just gets you access to do your due diligence. Okay, cool. Awesome. Well, I'm looking forward to diving into that tomorrow. I see Justin's back, so that was quick.

**Justin:** He, he's short to the point. He's like, I gotta go. I got too many listings. I was like, all right. 

**Athena:** How'd it go? 

**Justin:** Good. Good. He's a good, he is a really good guy. Probably my favorite broker I've talked with through throughout this whole process so far. Um, yeah, it, it was good. He was just asking, he's like, here are the, here's the, the things that the, uh, seller has an issue with.

There were two big, big components. One was, [00:47:00] uh, clarity around the, uh, time, his time commitment, post transition. 

**Gil:** Okay. Um, 

**Justin:** and then, and the other one was the standby, because I've got, I've got a healthy 10 year standby in there. Um, and so you goes 10 years. That's a long time. So, uh, we talked through some of that.

**Athena:** Great. Okay, cool. Well, I'm excited to dive in tomorrow. Yeah. Uh, get that all updated now. But that's good. That's, this is positive movement in the right direction, so, yeah. 

**Justin:** Not, it's not dead, basically, he's like, okay, lemme go back to him. I, you know, he was still motivated and energized about it, so I was like, all right, 

**Athena:** I love this.

So cool. Awesome. Well, um. Good stuff, good movement. Um, excited to talk to you both in detail tomorrow. I don't know if Steve and Paul are still here, but excited to talk about their stuff too. So lots of good things happening and please, please, everyone see, try and make it for Matt on Thursday. That's gonna be.

A really great session and something that all of you might want to [00:48:00] consider if you wanna go after these larger deals that you're looking at. So there's, there's additional capital options out there for folks that are very competent buyers, which you all are. So I'm excited. I've been wanting to get him on for a while so you can learn about the different types of, of capital that might be available, so 

**Polly:** that's awesome.

I'm looking forward to that actually. Yeah, 

**Athena:** me too. He's, he was, um. Very helpful. And in my, like when I, you know, went after a big deal and I was like, there's this whole world of like other capital providers and he, he gave me a lot of time when I was, uh, so he's also, um, somebody that's been pretty formative in like my process of learning and very helpful.

So I, I think he'll be really great and I. Broken down all the things, so we're gonna do one-on-one, but please come with your questions too, and interject, and you can make it about your personal situation. So, um, yeah, it'll, it'll be fun. I [00:49:00] think so. Great. Cool. Well have a good rest of your day y'all. I'll see you all tomorrow.

Uh, and then make sure you're blocking out your calendars for 3:00 PM Central on Thursday for Matt. Um, and I'll see you all tomorrow. Have a good day. Bye bye.
