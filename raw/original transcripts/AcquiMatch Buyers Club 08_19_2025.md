# AcquiMatch Buyers Club 08/19/2025

[00:00:00] 

**Athena:** Welcome, welcome. Hey Michael. How are you? How 

**Michael:** you doing? 

**Athena:** I'm great. Hey Justin. How's it going? Good, how are you? Amazing. Good. Thank you. Uh, I think Federico might be joining us as well. So Cool. Um, few of our normal virus clubs, attenders are on vacation this week, so I think it's just gonna be a few of us. Um, wanted to kick off with just a discussion.

Takeaways from the valuation conversation. So Justin, I think you were on the first half of that, and Michael, you were on it as well, um, with Eric Voice last week.

Yeah. Did anything stand out to you or what, what, like, if [00:01:00] anything, did you learn or take away from that conversation?

I mean, there was, it's always helpful just understanding what goes into valuation, uh, from professionals in the, in the field and hearing their take specifically because they sit like, this is what they do, as opposed to people who are tangentially related to like this world. It's, I I liken it to, uh, again, I always draw parallels to real estate, but like, um, like appraisers.

Who, that's their job is to actually, you know, ascribe a value to, um, a piece of real estate. Well, it's interesting hearing from people who this is what they do and, and you know, there's elements of like CPA or, or what a, you know, the accounting and how that folds into it, but then there's like the soft touch or I dunno if that's the right description, but you know what I mean.

Like some of these, uh, psychological elements almost that go into. What evaluation can be, which I [00:02:00] thought was interesting. Um, because I'm always such like a, well, what do the numbers say and like end of story situation. Um, so it was, I dunno, it was interesting to hear their perspective around just the holistic view of what that means, like how that's defined in their world.

Was there anything that like, stood out to you as, um, groundbreaking or a takeaway that you're gonna, that, that makes you like look at evaluations differently? I don't know. I, I'd have to think about it. I don't know. I've, uh, I don't know. I don't know if anything is groundbreaking, but That's a good question.

Uh, I'd have to think about that one 'cause I'm not sure if like, it's so ingrained in how I approach what I see as value and, and I would offer on those terms, right or wrong, probably wrong or not as holistically, you know, viewing something like they do an asset. Um, yeah, I mean, I'd have to, I [00:03:00] mean, I don't know.

I, I probably would take more into account, I guess. Like, I don't know, something I've been, I've been seeing a lot. I dunno, it's just the, the deals I've been evaluating recently, but there's a lot of these, you know, either 24 spikes in, in performance and or expectation of like year to date and the forecast for the rest of the year being.

Exceptionally good. And that's where a lot of the weight of the sellers and their brokers are placing the value. Yeah. And I've always very instantly dismissed future state 'cause it's like, I can't buy something that hasn't happened yet. Um, and certainly can't model towards a, a theory or a wish, you know, of where performance will ideally go.

But if the right markers are in place that indicate like. With relative security, that's the expectation. Then there could be a way where you're actually jumping in at like, you know, as the, the markers like going up to the right, right. [00:04:00] It's like you get in on a piece, like a little bit of a calculated risk adjusted.

Move, but then like under understanding like, well the rest of 25 and if they go so far as projecting based on contracts and how their business works, even in the 26th, it's like maybe there is a rationale behind, you know, structuring something that takes that kind of future state into account. And that's something I'd never really had given any credence to before, but it could also, it's not always just a risk thing.

It's also could be an upside thing because if you buy on a current performance. Then there's a lot of momentum that's gonna take this into future a, a healthier future come next year. Then you actually kind of maybe get to benefit riding a wave that, you know, provides a little tailwind. So, I don't know.

I mean, I can, I can think they're all, all the angles till blue in the face. Yeah. Well, something with like the, like if they're on an uptrend too, is. Getting them [00:05:00] to, to, you know, kind of weight that with a performance now, you know, it's like I've been doing a lot, you know, I've been doing a lot of those, like as part of Yeah.

Well, yeah. You know, I love them too. 'cause it's a great Yeah. Risk mitigator and it's like, well, how secure is the owner in that performance continuing? But it is, it is normal. Right? Sellers are advised to sell when they're at. In a good place when they're, when they're growing or on a growth trajectory? Um, gosh, I mean the, you know, in my own experience when I was in that like crazy situation with 13 other buyers going after that property management business, like they had.

Grown so substantially that the owners just were like, we, we can't handle this. Right? Like, we're, we're trying to slow down. Our kids are in high school. We don't travel. Like this is not for us. Um, so it was interesting and like had you [00:06:00] extrapolated that model into other markets, it would've 10 x the business in, in five years.

It was, you know, so that's why there were so many offers is because that growth was so attractive. Um, but. It's, it's interesting we're, we're experimenting with a tool that we're not quite ready to roll out to y'all, but like just a internal valuation metrics, but then also a tool that you can use yourself because there are things that are more.

Valuable to you that aren't necessarily like how business valuations are done, like how far it is from your house, or, you know, like different characteristics that it's like, well, that you can't necessarily put a, oh, this is how market valuations are done, but it's, it's incredibly valuable or not valuable to you depending on, on this situation.

So. Um, Michael, uh, are, is I, I don't, I don't know if the internet thing looked like maybe there was some internet problems, but curious to hear your thoughts from the discussion last week. Any [00:07:00] takeaways or any, any things that, you know, you found very interesting? 

**Michael:** Yeah, I, yeah, and I was, I, I think I've broken the code on what's happening.

I'll have to troubleshoot it later, but if I connect to the docking station, my, uh, screen goes black and that happened. Oh yeah. And not only goes back, but it turns the computer off, which, um. Anyway, um, not to share the details, but when I noticed that on the call at the end, I think we were just getting into the question and answer session.

And it kind of took me a minute to figure out what had happened. Um, I haven't, haven't reproduced it until I just connected my, uh, docking station to get to the other screen here and I dropped twice. So I think I've figured out what's causing it, just don't know how to solve it. Um, but I did like, um, to answer your question, um.

Yeah, there, there was a lot of good information there. I think it forces you to think, you know, um, begin with the end in mind, right? You know, on, you know, how you're, you know, where [00:08:00] we are on our journey to acquire business. And then what does that look like on day one? How do you, if needed, transition to what that looks like?

Um, either at perpetuity of runtime or at an exit. Right. And so it kind of forced you to think, um, yeah, I found, found myself thinking, okay, um, you know, it wasn't a really, a new concept that, you know, to have good financials or good, good SOPs. Right. I'm, maybe that's just my corporate experience, right?

Because that's all we kind of live with all the time. But, um. But, but that's to know you need them and, and to be able to put them in place for two different things and then know you need to get from point A to point B is something else. And so that was, um, you know, something to that, that's really the takeaway.

It was like, okay, when, when we, when we find the right business, get through all the immediate steps to close on it, get through day one, start through the date J Curve, get it to normalized. Then it's like, okay, now where do we take it from here? And you know, [00:09:00] those. Um, pillars. I guess he, I don't know what terminology he was using, but the pillars are the four, you know, main categories of the, you know, financials, operations, legal, and team, I think were three that always, or three or four that I always think of.

He, his are a little bit different, but I thought it was a good session really. It kind of got a little long-winded on you there, so I apologize for that. But I thought overall it was a good, a good session. 

**Athena:** That's cool. Um, so yeah, the SOPs thing, we were literally just on a, a team call about this, you know, like it's so rare for small businesses to have SOPs and documented processes and that sort of thing that it's like when we see it in a business, we're like, oh my God.

Wow. Like, it's, it's not normal. So that's, that's part of the, the, you know, it's struggle with going from like. You know, best in class corporate life to small business is, is kind of throwing out like, okay, well what do I think is normal or a risk factor when looking at these businesses? And oftentimes they do not have SOPs.

It's all on the owner's head. [00:10:00] And you get to be head SOP creator for the first 90 to 180 days running around after the owner documenting everything that's there, you know, and extracting that information. Um, so I thought something he said at the beginning was like, so interesting. You know, some of the stats he was throwing out, like only 39% do any kind of budgeting, and on average, most businesses only have one month of liquidity.

Like that was kind of shocking to me. And I, I've seen him do a presentation like this before. I don't, I don't, you know, the thing that that stuck with me the last time he did it was only 30% exceed a handover. But the one month liquidity was just like. That means that, that most owners are one month away from losing everything and you know, potentially bankruptcy.

Like it's terrifying when you think about it. Um, which is why that works. 

**Michael:** Catch that. And I don't know if it was a dynamic conversation, but I [00:11:00] did have a thought there. I hope you don't mind me inter interrupting, but Yeah, please. But, um, when he said liquidity though, was he talking about just cashing the bank or was he also considering, uh, an open line of credit like that seems.

A little bit thin running by the seat of your pants a little bit. Um, so 

**Athena:** yeah, a little 

**Michael:** eyeopening too, if that's the norm. Right? 

**Athena:** Well, it's, it's why we harp on the working capital thing so much. And then also like when you, when you're at the stage that you're speaking to lenders, we're, we're always telling you like, make sure you get a line of credit and working capital.

You want both, right? It's when you need. The line of credit when you need the working capital, you can't get it from the bank 'cause they're gonna look at your financials and see that you're in trouble. Most owners don't know that it's available to them. They're not getting it. Um, but when you need the money, when things are starting to go south, you can't get it, um, [00:12:00] by your umbrella 

**Michael:** when the sun was shining.

Yeah. 

**Athena:** Um, but also that means that like, and, and you know, that's how many businesses are on the brink of closing. You know, COVID was disastrous for so many businesses because like even getting like one month of no revenue, it just, it made them having to close their doors. So, something to think about is the new business owners, like, how are you building up?

Um, you know, the, the reserves to, to protect yourself in that situation, or having the line of credit available or building up the credit availability, um, to, but you know, when, when we talk about working capital, going into the new business. A lot of times people don't spend enough time looking at that and what that needs to be and getting a line of credit.

So then when the J curve hits, they don't have anything available to 'em. So I don't know if, um, you've caught Nan's [00:13:00] story. Justin, were you on the live call for that when we're not? Yeah, I mean, yeah, I, I don't know if I've shared the latest update, but he no longer has the business, so, um, no, I, I mean, last he said in the call was that he, you know, was going back to.

The W2 world to help subsidize in front and keep everything going. So, no, what's so he did, he lost the business altogether? Yeah. So, um, Michael, it's a, one of those Netflix special buyers club replaced to watch, um, Renan got, uh, a hundred percent seller financing on an $8 million enterprise value deal. Um, and he was kind of the poster child for Cody Sanchez, expounding, you know, a hundred percent seller financing.

Um, and, uh, things started going south in year two for him. Um, and he kind of bit off more than he could chew as trying to set up a fund and make more acquisitions, but also the business itself just started performing badly, uh, and he couldn't get. [00:14:00] Working capital, they couldn't get line of credit because it was a hundred percent seller financing.

He didn't have a bank involved to be able to extend that to him. So he was in a tough spot there. Um, and then I just spoke to him a couple weeks ago. Um, so anyways, when, when he came on buyer's club, he had gotten a job while also running this business. Said everything was good in a good place. When I spoke to him a couple weeks ago, um, he no longer has the business.

So it's something that I'm always thinking about as a business owner is like, how can I have more? Available if I need it, should I need it at any point. I mean, my friend Darius, who I should get him on Buyer's club at some point, he like scaled and exited his business. Uh, he scaled the business to like a billion.

And in that business, like he was talking about like one month, they couldn't make payroll. So he had to personally guarantee hundreds of millions of dollars in a loan to be able to like get cap. So I'm like, oh my God. It happens even at your level, like that's crazy. [00:15:00] Um, you know, so cashflow crunches are real.

The other thing that like stood out and um, was the owner's psychology, the owner readiness, you know, Tom said the most important thing you should dig into is the owner's reason for selling and their readiness to sell. Anyone else pick up on that or have thoughts on that?

I don't know if I, if there are any unique thoughts, but I mean, it's certainly something that goes into my line of questioning every time and, and yields. Unique results depending on that, that motivation and it can affect the trajectory of the, of the sale together. I mean, you know, we've, everyone's heard around like the silver tsunami of retirees and that whole thing, and I, again, I don't know if I'm just a weird sample set, but I've talked to very few instances in my cases have been because just traditional [00:16:00] retiring, right?

It's like, it's been a lot like some relocation, some uh, just. Strike with iron's hot again. Had a banner year sold into a high catch, a nice wind flow, uh, like windfall and, and exit to, you know, greener pastures. I don't know, it's, um, but I've not yet experienced much of the classic like, Hey, look, I just wanna retire.

Like, I'm, I'm been doing this for 20 years, 30 years or whatever, and I'm done. And, uh, that we see on all the marketing, uh, you know, for the whole generation of small business o owner, you know, transitions happening. Um. I, I am always a little, especially like I've had a couple instances where they're relocating to a different state or what have you, but then they're marketing it as like very, uh, like semi absent or even absentee friendly, whatever.

And every time I'm like, well, then why aren't you keeping your own business? Just running it that way yourself? If it's so good, it just, I don't [00:17:00] know, the logic doesn't add up and so I start going down a line of questioning and normally uncover some hair, uh, you know, on occasion. But, uh, that's one that always, you know, does, uh, peak a little bit of interest on, like, what's going on, like, why, you know, if that's the reason or, you know.

The sim and, and, and material says like, yeah, you can run this remotely. Well then why aren't you, you're just moving. Um, that certainly I think has a different response from me than like, if I were to talk to somebody who's just aging and they're like, look, I'm just done. You know, and there's, I don't have, you know, kids that who want to take up the business or what have you.

It's like, great. I get that. Makes a lot of sense. But, uh, yeah. It's, um, I mean it's even, even when they should retire, you know, they don't want to. So I thought that was interesting how Tom was saying, or maybe it was Eric. You know, oftentimes it's like a family member that's like, I, I want [00:18:00] you to spend more time, or I want you to slow down, or I want you to do this.

So like, where is the, where is the pressure coming from? Um, to sell Or is is it like the owner's decision or is it a, a family type thing? Um, we just had a, a, a, a seller who was 85 years old, decide to keep the business anyway. 'cause it just, you know, and it's like, that seemed like a good reason. But even the thing that we're told and when it's like retirement age, like, you know, maybe they don't wanna let go of it.

So, um, but something I, you know, that. This is just also something that I don't think it's talked about enough and what I wanted to try to dig into with them, Eric, you know, kind of Eric comes at it from like a mentoring perspective, Tom, from like the valuation and what you can actually measure, but the owner psychology and what state of [00:19:00] mind that the owner is in.

When they run the business, um, I think being a business owner is one of the most personally challenging thing that anyone will do, right? You're responsible for the livelihood of a bunch of people. Your decisions impact those people, impact the clients. You know, you're a month away from losing everything for most businesses.

Um. And we've all been in situations where we've worked in, you know, not great environments or for not great people. So what state of mind or how do, what's the owner's kind of.

Like, how is the owner managing themselves? How are they under stress? How do they, you know, talk to people? How do they handle those sorts of things that, that's a DNA thread that will like run through businesses. The culture that you're gonna have to go into and, and, you know, most businesses have people, so, [00:20:00] um, I wish it was talked about more.

I think it's probably not because it's like one of those things that's hard to quantify and score, um, in terms of valuation. But I, I loved that it was like one of the, the pillars that they were talking about. Um,

yeah. Um, any. Other thoughts on the valuation? Um, team curious. You guys are looking at businesses all the time and you see all the different methods that. Brokers are using to value businesses. You know, so like what's the disparity between what you see and what the brokers are saying versus, you know, like how the valuation is looked at from like, you know, and Eric and his team do it for SBA, so for every SB angle and they have to get a business valuation.

So curious if there was anything in there that you guys were chuckling about, you know, having all the broker interactions that you do, or you know. Well, my side of it is [00:21:00] normally when I see a seller had gotten a third party valuation from a valuation firm, I'm sure Eric and his firm doesn't do this, but that third party valuation always.

Comes at a price so much higher than the true market value of the business. Interesting. And yeah, I mean, I would've just understand it as kind of mis misaligned incentives, right? Because if I'm the valuation firm and this seller's coming to me saying, how much is my business worth? I don't wanna upset them and tell 'em it's worth this number.

'cause you know, Athena, how sensitive sellers are about the value of their business. Uh, so that's kind of what, uh, what I was thinking. But then they went through the different methods and I can tell that they definitely do good work. And like you said, they get the SBA valuation process. So it was really interesting to hear, hear their take on things.

I'm sure they're a lot more kind of above water than a lot of the val third party valuations I've seen in the space. Interesting. Um. Harris, what, what, uh, you were on sell side for a long time, so let's, what's your [00:22:00] experience with the valuation side of things? 

**Charis:** Yeah. Um, well, there's a big difference between a standard business valuation and a business appraisal.

So, and you are gonna be, like, if you hire a third party to do a standard business valuation, you're looking at anywhere between like. A thousand to like two to 3000 a business appraisal, you're gonna be paying 10 to 50,000. It's a much different, uh, spectrum. So, um, you know, on a standard business valuation, you can look at it for like one to three page explanation, valuation, probably one method and then an appraisal.

Um, like you had on our call last week, um, they are, uh, apprais appraisers. So they're the, they're the real deal in terms of formality. [00:23:00] Now, usually a business owner doesn't go for a business appraisal because of how expensive it is. So it takes a certain situation where. Usually if it's gonna be a potential for a dispute on the valuation, for instance, either it's like, um, some sort of legal matter, a divorce, or, um, a an exiting partner, and there can be a dispute on the valuation.

Usually you'll get a business appraisal, um, because that also comes with the need to be provide like witness testimony by the appraiser for their explanation of the valuation. So you're talking very different terms in why it's needed and its investment costs, and many times a business owner. It's hard for them to foot that bill and maybe they [00:24:00] don't need it for that reason, right?

So they'll go with a, um, a standard business valuation that doesn't require those certifications in order to provide that valuation. So you're gonna see an array of ways that they're gonna do it. Um, on the sell side, for clients that I've worked with, I've always done a market based approach. Because we're looking at current comps, current supply and demand, current prices that they're actually selling for, and nothing more or less you take, you definitely take factors of.

What the market's going for, the multiples that you're gonna find. But at the end of the end of the day, the market is dependent on what a buyer's willing to pay. And so we'll take a market approach and look really at, um, those ranges. Um, and that'll really tell you, um, you know, the, the temperature. [00:25:00] Yeah, anything besides that, you're, you're looking into playing with all sorts of different, uh, weights, um, and variables, but yeah, I thought that the, the call with the, the business appraisers were, it was really helpful and I think them putting those three methods together and waiting them, um, that's a, that's a smart approach to do it.

Yeah. 

**Athena:** Um, it was interesting, Justin, you jumped off, but like at the end, Tom like stopped and we were like signing off and Tom's like, wait, is anyone in Austin? And I, I saw him, he mentioned Cedar Park, and I was like, that's literally my, I mean, it's five minutes for me. Yeah, well he is like, there is a market premium on Austin.

I was like, we are aware. Yeah, yeah. I, I'm painfully feeling that. Yeah. So like in places where there are, you know, and, and like to car's point, it's [00:26:00] seller's market right now. There are, you know, more buyers and sellers and in these hotspot geographies where there's a whole bunch of searchers. You know, it's like, will people wanna stay in Austin?

It's a very tiny market when you look at like, you know, business supplies. So you are paying a premium in some of these markets. Um. You know, 'cause people don't wanna go into the middle of nowhere Texas, where there's nothing around and, and buy a business. So I, I was thinking of you Justin, but if you watch the very, very last minute of the replay, like, I have to go, I'll have to go back to the replay.

Yeah. He was like, wait, wait, hold the phone before we sign off. Like I just need to talk about Austin is is funny and I always like meeting like professionals in the space in market anyway, so it's a good reason for me to connect with them. Yeah. No, Eric, Eric's great too. Um, and, and they go to the, there's a, there's a [00:27:00] local lender meetup that when I see the next one, I'll, I'll send it to you.

'cause Eric usually goes to that one too. But, um, that was, that, that, that made me laugh. I was like, where's Justin when we need him? So, um, cool. They are, they are gonna come back, um, to do a wealth management discussion. Which I think is really important, both from understanding, um, you know, where the owner might be at, but also as a new owner, you have all these tools available to you that you don't as the W2.

Um, so getting ahead of that and thinking about it, um, I certainly really struggled being out of the country for 12 years. I still am, um, trying to wrap my head around all the, you know, retirement options and the health savings accounts and all of those sorts of things. So, um, they're gonna be talking about, you know, what tools are available in the toolkit, wealth management style, um, as a business owner.

That's gonna be on the 4th of September [00:28:00] on, uh, this coming Thursday. Roman who is, he is a force and he is gonna be talking tax strategy, um, both for buying, uh, and also like after the fact when you're an owner. Um, this is one of the topics that I cannot get enough. Information about, and again, it's not talked about very much because it can end up becoming a deal breaker down the line with the seller.

You know, the asset versus stock sale and what the tax situation is for both of you. So crucial. And a lot of times the brokers aren't preparing the sellers for what their tax situation's gonna be. So when they, they realize what the tax bill is gonna be like, that can kill the deal. Um, so that's gonna be a great conversation on, on Thursday.

I'm super excited for that. And like I said, Roman's a force. He is super fun to listen to. So if any, anyone were to teach taxes, like you want someone that's like super high energy and in your face. Um, anyways, I was gonna ask, uh, so [00:29:00] Justin, I know you've got a couple things going on, seeing if there's any updates on, on your side, anything worth discussing?

Um. The, the coworking space. I, uh, I basically made, you know, my position clear. Again, reiterated with the broker, it's like, look, you know, if he wants the price, he's gotta work on terms. And he responded and he is like, all right, let me keep working on 'em and we'll see. It's like, all right, so, uh, yeah, TBD, if there's gonna be movement there, um.

Let's see what else. I've, uh, I got some updated projections for the, uh, like power sports offroad, uh, dealership, uh, uh, number. So reworking those and gonna reach back out. Broker probably set up another seller called just to dig in a little bit more, but, um, that went well. I mean, I, I think it's a little overpriced.

Um, so. I have to figure [00:30:00] that out and see how flexible. The one thing I don't know yet is how flexible the seller is on, you know, terms like price, everything, all the levers, right? Yeah. And so I'm trying to uncover more about that. Um, but that'll gimme more information once I, uh, understand kind of some of the motivation there.

Uh, but I, I, you know, I, I like them as people. The broker's really nice, you know, seller's. Really nice. Um, we hit it off, so that was good. And then, um. Let's see. Yeah. You know, the roofing thing that's kind of dead. Uh, yeah, I don't know. Oh, and I saw the, the new, uh, apparently new write-ups coming in. So, uh, standing by for that.

Interested to see what, what Luke has to say about that one. Yeah. That'll give you guys some stuff to talk about tomorrow. Okay, cool. Well, um, yeah, so, you know, the price and terms thing, um, it's a, it's, it's. Interesting. You know, I mean, you just, you just [00:31:00] saw what happened with the other deal. They, they're, they're holding out for their price and their terms, so that can be unfortunate.

Right. But usually you can, if there's no other buyers on the table, which for that other one there isn't. But like I said, you know, by the time they come around you might have moved on and found something else. So we'll see what happens there. Yeah. Um. Cool. Well, excited to, to see what you think about the new one.

And then, um, Michael, the team's got some stuff ready for you, so they will be getting in touch with you to take you through the first writeup process, get all the NDA signed, get that writeup over to you. Um, so that's coming your way. So you'll have some stuff to be discussing on these calls soon also. Um, but yeah, I'm super excited for.

Thursday. Um, that's one I've been wanting to have for a long time, so I hope you all can make that one. Or if you can't, definitely watch the replay 'cause um, taxes could be a massive thing, you know. Um. Especially if you're not preparing [00:32:00] for it, like that first tax bill after you take it over can, uh, can be devastating.

So should be a fun one, um, to go through. Uh, anything else before we sign off? We'll give you some, some time back. Good for me. Awesome. Well, good to see you all. Excited for Thursday. Excited to see how you get on with your deals. Um, and we'll see you all very soon. Have a great rest of your day. Good deal.

Appreciate you too. Take care. Bye bye.
