# AcquiMatch Buyers CLub 08/12/2025

[00:00:00] 

**Steve Geng:** So the component that they had, I, I read through the SBA pre-approval letter, said anybody with 20% or more equity stake has to personally guarantee. But this was done, the pre-approval was done in April. I thought the new laws took a place in what June. So I'm not sure how relevant some of the terms on that letter are 

**Athena:** at this point.

No, that's always been the case. Yeah. So like any, anyone that has more than 20% ownership in the new entity has to personally guarantee. So that's a standard. Term. Term that that hasn't changed. 

**Steve Geng:** Don't the new laws say though that anybody who's got a stake, was it even like 10% or is that, I don't know. It was confusing when it came out.

**Athena:** Ah, okay. Good. Um, good, good, good point. So. New owners as somebody that hasn't been a previous equity holder of this business, right? They only need a person to guarantee if they have more [00:01:00] than 20% ownership. So say you bring in an investor and they get 19% equity. Most of the times they won't need to personally guarantee the bank's gonna do some digging on like who your investors are, what their involvement's gonna be, et cetera.

If they feel like they're materially gonna be involved, then they might say, Hey, they also need to personally guarantee. But if we're to just go off of SOP standard stuff, um, less than 20% of new ownership. So where, where you're, you're thinking about is if you do rollover equity to a previous owner of the business.

Yeah. So any percentage of equity of somebody who previously had equity in the business before the transaction, they will also need to personally guarantee them. 

**Steve Geng:** Okay. 

**Athena:** That's where it's, it's being complicated when you have a, a business where a license holder is required, right. And usually what we used to do was have the, the previous owner, like hold 1% [00:02:00] equity.

Um, but they wouldn't have had to, to personally guarantee the full loan. So does that make sense? New ownership versus ship? It does. It does. 

**Steve Geng:** Yeah. So if, if they, if, if this guy here who said, Hey, you'll take 30% of the company, 20% of the company, 10% of the company doesn't matter. He's responsible on the hook for everything.

Um, okay. So the other question that I have is typically, how often do you see a 30% equity requirement on an SBA loan? 

**Athena:** Yeah, we were just literally, the team, were all talking about a deal where the pre-qual from the SBA came back like 40 to 50% equity. So usually it means one of two things. One, their asking price is too high, so in order for the debt service to work on the loan, you need to inject a certain amount of equity.

So you know, then it's like, well, what's the multiple, what's the debt service coverage ratio? If you were to just do the standard 10% equity, is it too tight? Or there's some risk in the [00:03:00] business that. Um, the SBA saw, so they want their portion of the guarantee covered. 'cause remember, SBA only only guarantees 75% of the loan.

You put it in 10%, so it leaves 'em a 15% exposure. But if they're asking for 25, 30%, then guess what? They're fully covered basically for their exposure. So there might be a risk point in the business. Um, what I typically do in that scenario is ask the broker like, Hey, why are they asking for 25, 30%? Like what, what was the reasoning behind that?

**Steve Geng:** Okay. I did see also that while they have 65 customers, um, uh, the average customer, remember their monthly based customer base, uh, re renewing every month. Uh, they churn about every 10 point some odd months. So, you know, the question I'm going off is, why can't they hold them? 

**Athena:** Yeah, that's a good question to [00:04:00] ask, like why is a churn that high?

Um, then you gotta look at their customer acquisition costs, you know, like what is, what is the actual lifetime value of the customer and what's the cost to obtain a customer for them? Um, and equally, why aren't they staying on longer than 10 months? What, what specific services are they offering? Do you remember?

**Steve Geng:** Yeah, elder care, law services and, um, estate planning. 

**Athena:** But for those clients, so those are the end clients, right? 

**Steve Geng:** Oh, what service are they doing for these folks? Mm-hmm. Three different packages. I'm gonna have to go from memory right now. The basic, basic is, you know, the, the not much package, like $700 a month, um, where you're not even getting like SEO, I think the $2,500 probably was the sweet spot.

They say the average customer's paying about 30 some, 30 some hundred dollars. So they'll do website. Maintenance, SEO services. Um, [00:05:00] if you step up the package, they'll do things like, uh, I think Facebook ads, some social blog posts and, and that type of stuff. What I wasn't clear, we haven't spoken to 'em yet, is who's managing that or they just giving them content.

A newsletter was one of the things. They're giving like a weekly newsletter to their email. List and you know, so, you know, I've got lots of questions, obviously, but I'm, you know, that's some of the business model. My question is, okay, how many e how many people do you have on your email list that you're giving news?

You're sending newsletters out. That's one of the ways they get their business. And are you monetizing that any other way? Uh, there's a lot of questions at this point, but it seemed very, very basic services. SEO, I didn't even see a lot of paper click in there, but it was. Facebook ads, uh, social post blog posts.

And um, it seems to me like what they're doing is they get a whole bunch of lawyers, they put together a newsletter. They privately will each one of them to send to their customers. [00:06:00] That's part of the, part of the deliverable. So it seems like there's content delivery, uh, to get to their customers. I think, and Kyle, you can keep me honest on this, but they even are trying to do like what local seminars for customers they can pay to set up a seminar like in a hotel, I guess, or something.

**Athena:** Holly, you're muted.

**Polly:** They do an annual summit. I don't know how many attendee attendees that they have. It's grown over the years. The broker didn't know the exact amount of attendees, but I think they do it at their office. So if it's a shared workspace. It may not be a lot, but, um, I did ask, you know, if it was primarily their, their customer base was Florida and he said yes.

He said primarily Florida. There are some, um, accounts that they [00:07:00] have nationally, so in other parts of the country, but the big concentration is in Florida. 

**Steve Geng:** So this too, Polly, did you mention, and I'm sorry I was late, but, uh, did you mention that somebody else looked at the business and they had a personal issue and back up?

**Polly:** No. So apparently there was LOI, they were moving, you know, to, to uh, due diligence and so forth. And, and they had gotten pretty far into the process. And, uh, apparently this, this buyer, potential buyer, um, ended up. Basically pulling the offer because there was a, a, from what the broker said, a death, a like a tragic death in the family of the owner.

Um, or the buyer, I'm sorry, the potential buyer. So, um, they pulled the offer and didn't go through with it. So again, you know, 

**Steve Geng:** [00:08:00] I, I, I just say maybe that's true. Um, and sorry for that. Maybe it's not. I take a look at, okay, you have the SBA, it wants 30% equity. You've got somebody who went three quarters away through due diligence and pulled the plug for whatever reason.

You know, that's a, that's flag number two. And you have the owner saying that he will not accept anything less than the price he got, which was less price for the last one. 

**Athena:** Mm-hmm. Um, I, I think the thing that I would wanna dig into is the, um, churn. Because if, if they're delivering, uh, either one of two things is happening, they're not demonstrating the value that they're bringing to customers or they're not giving good enough value that the customers want to stay with it.

Because if I'm outsourcing my marketing and they're, and I'm getting business as a result of that, I'm not. Gonna turn that off, right? So that to me is like an inherent, and then, you know, you should probably do some research on what industry standard churn [00:09:00] rate is and see whether they're in line with that or not.

Um, to me, I mean, gut feels like. Well, you haven't even had a full calendar year. But at the same time, it takes a while to warm up marketing and actually start seeing results. So are they just not doing a great job of managing client expectations and demonstrating value when they are doing things right, or are they not actually delivering value, both of which are kind of a problem, right?

So, um. How, how knowledgeable was the broker when you were talking to him about some of this stuff? Or was it, uh, oh, you'll need to speak to the owner about that kind of thing? 

**Polly:** Um, pretty knowledgeable of course on the basic questions. The ones I'm sure he gets most often, some of which I asked, but, you know, some that were a little more in depth.

He, he definitely said you would need to talk to Jim, the owner about it. Okay. 

**Athena:** And then obviously, you know, we've, we've had this come up a couple times, but what are their plans [00:10:00] around ai? You know, how are they incorporating that? How are they planning around it? Are they doing anything to incorporate it and make them better?

Or is it also writing's on the wall. They know what's coming and then they're trying to get out kind of thing. So I think 

**Steve Geng:** in the, the sim it was addressed. I will say this, and Polly is spot on. That is, it came from, um, I can't remember, quiet light or whatever that sim was the best sim that I've seen so far with thorough question.

Uh, I was, you know, I was, you know, literally I had a million questions. I started reading, said, read the sim. I read the sim, like, and I answered that question, answered that. But he did mention, uh, something about. You know, leveraging AI to enhance as an opportunity for the business. 

**Athena:** Oh, right. Okay. An opportunity but 

**Steve Geng:** not, yeah, an opportunity.

They're not using it, but it's an opportunity for, you can grow the business, so. 

**Athena:** Right. Okay. Uh, by the way, quiet Light is, is one of the better brokerages. Um, that was actually founded by Walker Diebel who wrote by the bill. So, um, [00:11:00] I don't know his involve entrepreneur now, but I, I do know that he. Was involved in, in at least founding it.

I haven't heard his name associated with it in a while, which is why I say I don't know what his involvement now is, but, um. So I, you know, I, I think there's such an opportunity in niche marketing businesses when they, when they go after a niche that typically probably doesn't get a lot of love in the past.

I mean, we looked at a digital marketing business for dentists that was doing absolutely insane numbers. 'cause they were really good. Like, who's helping, you know? Um. But when there's a niche, then you're able to speak to your customer, which is kind of marketing 1 0 1, like know your customer, be able to speak to them.

So it's interesting, but it sounds like there's some, some serious questions for the owner around his intentions and, um, maybe again with the broker about like, well, why, why that kind of equity injection down from the buyer and then. I wanna know what the turn [00:12:00] rate, what's going on with the turn rate, like, is that industry standard or not?

Or why do they think their customers are turning? Um, so I think you can approach that on the owner call without getting their defenses up. After you build rapport, um, just be like, Hey, so I noticed your customers stay with you on average about 10 months. Is that normal? Is that part of the package? Like, you know, just.

I noticed and talking about it, rather than saying like, why are your customers leaving after 10 months? You know? Mm-hmm. Um, just like, hey, so it looks like your average lifecycle for a customer is 10 months. Is is that normal? Like, do you guys, it, you know, is that the amount of time that they need you or, um, 'cause that's what I'm curious about.

Like, maybe they just get 'em on their way and then, and then they're like, well, I know how to write my own newsletters now so they're leaving 'cause they feel like they could do it on their own and or teams not demonstrating value there. 

**Steve Geng:** You know, and also I look at the, the devils in the data, right? So when you take a look at it, if you, it is an average of 10.8 months.

So maybe, you know, in that [00:13:00] industry or any industry you've got, you're not a tech savvy crowd to begin with, and they're expecting results on month one or two. They don't see it right away, and they're back and that's gonna skew. So my bigger question is. How many of the 65 customers have been with you more than a year or more than two years?

They've been around eight years. Um, because it's, you know, it's, that'll, that'll skew the numbers, the impatience, uh, and the lack of, of understanding on how this works. It doesn't, you don't pay for it and all of a sudden you got, uh, a hundred leads coming in your door next week in a local t. 

**Athena:** Yeah. And, and the thing is, is that they might be really good at doing what they do, but they need longer with the clients.

And maybe they're not great at communicating that upfront. And like, like you said, for the end users, they don't know or understand how marketing works. And I mean, I know it, it can take a very long time to figure out what ads work, what, what [00:14:00] works in terms of conversion, et cetera. Um. Sounds like you know all the questions to ask.

Um, on the next one, what's, what's your excitement level after speaking with the broker? Um, 

**Steve Geng:** yeah, you spoke to him. Go ahead. Go ahead. No, I was gonna say you spoke to the broker, your excitement level after speaking to the broker. I, I mean, I've got questions. I love the, the idea that it's a niche and a niche of, of folks who have, have a budget, so.

Mm-hmm. You know, they're not low end people. Uh, there's typically a budget, and it's a niche that everybody's thinking. Personal, uh, injury attorney, big, big bucks. You know, nobody's thinking about estate planning and elder care people. So, um, I, I love the niche. Um, it's just. I've got some questions that make, would make me feel more comfortable and to, you know, I'll be brutally honest.

You know, how I feel about, you know, I wanna understand what's the AI strategy, [00:15:00] but Paul, you told, you spoke to him so you know, more on 

**Polly:** a scale from one to 10. Um, you know, the broker was, uh, as knowledgeable as he could be. Based upon the information that he has, which, you know, he, he did want me to, he, he did.

He, he was one of those brokers who really knew, knew the answers to the questions I, I asked, but at the same time, he really wanted us to have a conversation with a seller, which is a good thing. So, um, so I would say on an excitement level, I would say I'm probably at like a seven and a half because I think there are some questions that we really need to get answered first.

So, 

**Athena:** yeah. And gosh, talking about a growing need, right? That market is 

**Polly:** the absolutely. The baby boomer market, that's all you have to think about right there. But 

**Athena:** yeah, estate planning and all of this stuff, it's like literally people leave it too late. I hear, I mean, [00:16:00] I go to all these conventions all this time for like people that help with exit planning, right?

And mm-hmm. People don't, don't. Um, plan for it, and then their kids end up getting screwed over, can't get their estate off. Like, there's all sorts of things. And like with all of this transfer wealth and the, the percentage of wealth that sits with boomers right now is the majority. Right. So it's, um, it's really interesting niche.

**Polly:** Yeah, I think so. The other thing No, 

**Steve Geng:** go ahead. I'm sorry. 

**Polly:** No, I said, I, I, I said I agree. I think it is. I'd say the other thing 

**Steve Geng:** that is a little bit, you know, kind of a concern we gotta dig into deeper on as well, is the folks, they want to be hybrid. They don't want to be remote. They want to go to the office three days a week.

So when you start peeling the numbers back, you got 10 employees total. One is the founder, two is his wife, that's two. Then you got another four that are all local and [00:17:00] they like to, they're together in the office. So you have six at. Six outta 10 at least, uh, six outta 10 are part of a, a group that if he ever did decide to say, I'm taking it, that's your brain.

You know, the contractors are great, but the, the brain trust right there that's been running it for the past is, that's two thirds of your employees. So just, just the how, how to keep them on is a big, uh, portion. 

**Athena:** Well, if they're in a, they're in a coworking space. 

**Steve Geng:** They do a coworking space, but I think they all go in right.

**Athena:** Yeah, but I mean, like if even if you were to transition to remote, like there's nothing to stop you from still paying for their coworking space if they like going in and being around each other or going to the coworking space too. Yeah, 

**Steve Geng:** I think my point was that, that they're, it's a tight group with the owner that it's easier to pull somebody I know for eight years.

Hey, Athena, come on with us. We're doing something new now. You know, you now, now you got [00:18:00] six, two thirds or more of your, of your, uh. Brain trust, you know, that's a risk and that's, you know, how to mitigate that risk. 

**Athena:** Yeah. Well we can do that in the structuring, right? Yeah. It's like, it's, it's very customary to include a non-compete, um, for the owners.

And, and, and you can include like a non circumvention or non-solicitation of the, of the team. You know, like, and or, but some, if you're considerably worried about a specific team member. Jumping ship. You can put performance based forgivable notes around team as well as revenue numbers. Right? So there's stuff we can do with the structuring to mitigate the risk.

That's good to be aware of it and go into it. Um, but anything that you're concerned about that, um, isn't like a complete deal breaker, like fraud or stuff like that, there's usually a way to mitigate it in, in some way with the structuring or things that we can put in place, place when we get to that point.

[00:19:00] Mm-hmm. All good stuff. So cool. Um, so you feel ready for the call? Any other questions 

**Polly:** or? Yeah, I should look to see if, uh, nope, I don't, um, no. Still waiting for his confirmation for noon tomorrow for calls with the seller, so just looked at my email real quick and, uh, hasn't gotten back to me yet, so hopefully so.

**Athena:** Can't wait to hear the updates after that. Yeah. Good stuff. Um, awesome. So Gil, I know you were going back and forth. I don't know if there's, uh, any new news or whether it's worth talking about. 'cause I think it was a really interesting learning point that you took away from, uh, your, your situation. 

Yeah.

Uh, I've, I've had radio silence, uh, from him, uh, ever since I sent the mail, uh, it was around, it's. Oh, about 25, 26 hours at this point, um, [00:20:00] I. I have no idea. I'll follow up one more time. I think maybe tomorrow or, or Thursday. Uh, but if not, this deal might be dead. Um, but yeah, no, uh, this is a negotiation, not a one, not, not a, it's back and forth, not a one way street, you know?

So. 

**Athena:** Yeah, do you mind if I give some context? 'cause I think what you did was pretty smart. Um, so Gill's working on a deal where it's, it's actually somebody that previously bought the business, um, a couple years ago. So the, the owner is selling it himself, um, and. Had an offer, like he originally listed it and then he was getting higher offers, higher than what he listed it at.

So that became his new number. Um, so Gil is uniquely qualified, I'd say probably more so than the other buyers to be. Even, even the, the current owner who bought it. Gil has exceptional experience in this [00:21:00] arena. Um, and so. There was a year in, in the past where the business had performed better than it had in the most recent years.

So when we see. Um, like a spike in revenue in the past, and we can offer a performance based forgivable vote, which is the SBA friendly term for an earnout, which is we're incentivizing the owner with more money, um, if they can help us get the business. To perform at a level that it had performed at in the past.

Now, we can't do this if the business has never achieved that kind of revenue before. So for example, these aren't the actual numbers for Gill, but let's say in 2022 they got 2 million in revenue, and then 23 in 24, they were more at like the 1.5 million in revenue range. Well, we can say, I'm gonna offer you this amount of money and this percentage of my offer is a forgivable performance based note.

Based on you [00:22:00] achieving 2 million in revenue in the first year that I own the business and it's forgiven, meaning you don't have to pay it. Or a portion of that will be forgiven depending on, on where the business, uh, tracks. We can also use this just to get them to like perform as they did in the previous year, so to try to mitigate against revenue dips.

But in Gill's case, we were trying to incentivize, it's like, okay, we hear you, that you want that amount of money. It's not worth it to just offer you that with no conditions because it put guilt kind of at a disadvantage. But if we were to get. The revenue back to the way it had performed in the past, then it was like, okay, I'd be happy to offer you that much money.

Um, and this portion of the note, um, so say like 25% or whatever, I'll, I'll pay you an extra 25% if you get the business back to that. So Gil was going back and forth with the seller. Initially, he [00:23:00] seemed interested in it and he was sending some messages that we were like, we're, we don't think he's getting this concept.

You know, because we were like, what? Like me Car and Gil were all like reading this message. Like, what is he talking about? So Gil had this great idea to put a couple scenarios together. So here's how much money you'll make if you hit this revenue. Here's how much money you'll make if you kind of hit this revenue.

Here's how much money you'll make if you don't hit it at all. Um, and I thought that was a really great idea from Gill because one of the problems that can happen to y'all is you go through this process is you get the seller to agree to something like networking capital. Or an asset sale and they don't understand what they're agreeing to.

And then you get so far down the line and right before you sign on the dotted line, they cancel it because they didn't understand what they'd agreed to in the first place. And or after you close on the business, they still don't understand. And then you're trying to [00:24:00] sort it out with people after the fact.

So it's better, even though it's a little bit painful if, if the deal falls apart this early on, it's better to get that kind of clarity. With the seller so that, that you don't end up spending money or go through that whole process of getting lending and doing due diligence. And they're like, wait, what, what did I agree to?

You know? Um, so I thought it was really cool that, that Gil did that. But when the seller understood what he was talking about and he said, no way I am doing that, and just kind of ended the call. So. Uh, that's where we're at now. Gil sent a message like, let him cool off for a couple days and then send a message like, Hey, you know, curious how you thought about things.

Like, I'm happy to see if we can make the terms work on both sides. Um, but we're in that situation where the seller wanted both his price and his terms and. You know, it needs to work for you also, it needs to work for you, [00:25:00] the buyer. So if they want a certain price, then making the terms get to a point where you're comfortable with it, like a forgivable note.

Um, and or you give your price and they get it on their terms. But giving them both usually puts you the buyer at a disadvantage and doesn't make it worth it. So, um, yeah. Gil, I think you did really good on that one, and you're, you're getting. Uh, a lot more experience on the negotiation side of things, which can be, um, intense.

**Gil:** Yeah. 

**Athena:** Um, so Gil, uh, utilizes and I, I recommend this for y'all too. Um, and it's, it's something that has been an absolute game changer for me is like using chat GBT or whatever your favorite AI tool is, um, giving it some context and then helping it, uh, you know, either prep [00:26:00] you for the negotiations or write some language around it.

Um, so Gil's a pretty awesome user of AI in these circumstances too. Um, the brief I always like to give the AI is like, what would Chris Voss the author of never split the difference do in this situation? Or how would he handle this? Um, so some good stuff. Okay, so we're playing the waiting game. Steve.

I'll come back. 

**Gil:** Yep. 

**Athena:** Yeah, sometimes they just need to cool off, you know, they like, it's not what he wanted to hear. But from the sounds of things, it didn't sound like you got any other live offers if we're giving him everything he wanted, either. 

No, I don't think so. Um, he's also sitting himself, no broker, so I, I'm not sure how well that's going for him, because I know that he has two other businesses that he's.

Getting off the ground. Um, and I think this is just running on autopilot for him. 

**Athena:** Right. Um, so he wants the cash for his other businesses, but it's [00:27:00] not like a need to exit immediately kind of situation. 

**Gil:** Yeah. 

**Athena:** Um, the other thing that's interesting about what he was saying, and I I've seen this when we've talked to sellers who've bought the business before, is like, yeah.

If they bought the business and they got screwed on the terms, then they think it's that, that, that the new buyer should also get the same terms. So I, I was kind of picking up on some of that with him. He is like, I didn't get working capital when I bought the business. 

**Gil:** Yeah, yeah. Most definitely. So, yeah, when I, when I bought it, I paid for inventory, I paid for working capital.

I'm like, okay. 

**Athena:** Well that, yeah, so like, and you're not the only one. I've seen this happen to, I've seen it in like other deals where it's like, if the seller who's selling the business bought the business, it's amazing how many of them didn't, didn't do working capital. They didn't look at financials, they didn't have due diligence done, they didn't use SBA financing.

So like they kind of got screwed on, on their deal [00:28:00] in that sense. And so it's like, well, that's what I got. So that's what you should get. So you have to overcome that in this instance too, when you have a seller that, that was the previous buyer. 

**Gil:** Yeah. 

**Athena:** So 

**Gil:** cool. 

**Athena:** Yeah. Good stuff. Well let us know if you hear anything else on that.

**Gil:** Yeah, most definitely. 

**Athena:** Awesome. Um, good. I don't think Justin, you've probably gotten any updates on, you've have not heard anything, have you? 

**Justin:** Uh, I've got a couple updates, yeah. Oh, 

**Athena:** great. Yeah, let's hear 'em. 

**Justin:** Good. Um, well, 

**Athena:** updates, updates are good. You know, it's, it's, it's movement. Yeah. Yeah. It's movement. 

**Justin:** And as you know, I'll take it.

Um, yeah, so I, I actually don't know. I, I got a call, uh, from, uh, the hometown broker, but he, um, I was on, it was in a meeting and so I couldn't, I couldn't take it. And then, uh, he said he was opting into a meeting and we've been, he said he'd call me back this afternoon. So we'll see if that [00:29:00] happens. Um. And that, yeah.

So I don't know what that's gonna be yet. Uh, I talked to the broker for the coworking space. Um, he is pushing back or on behalf of the seller, pushing back on most of the performance note. The seller sounds like that he's valuing the company at. What effectively was performance from two years ago and kind of holding onto that and it's just not worth that.

So it's interesting he's relaying, and it sounds like the broker kind of agrees with me, but he doesn't, you know, he is trying to get the seller to understand and he doesn't know how to do that effectively. Uh, gosh, what else? Yeah, so in a nutshell, um, there. He's asking too much. He said he wants equity. He goes, can you include equity?

And I said, well, why? I mean, he goes, well, so he can have a piece, you know, of, of the, uh, interest moving forward [00:30:00] and, and, you know, feel like he's part of the, where the, the valuation should be. You know, should it, it. Increase and, and get for the, for the better. And I go, well, that's what the performance was intended to do.

Like if he has a higher valuation in mind, that is the alignment. If he and I collaborate to ensure that happens, he will get the payment he wants. And he got a chuckle, the brokerage chuckled. He is like, yeah, I know. He just doesn't, you know, so it, I, I don't know. We, I don't know if that'll, we'll get over that 'cause he's just got this valuation in his mind that isn't worth what it is and he wants equity and not performance.

Uh, but yeah, it just doesn't make a lot of sense for me to just give him equity. 

**Athena:** No, and you're, I mean, this was one of those like, you're kind of the only option 'cause you figured out a way. Mm-hmm. So it might just be a slow burn, you know? Yeah. 

**Polly:** At 

**Athena:** some point that tipping point happens. Hopefully you're still available when it does.

If not, yeah, 

**Justin:** we'll, we'll see. See, 

**Athena:** you might, might lose the opportunity on a buyer that figured out a way to finance this deal when [00:31:00] the majority of other buyers can't. 

**Justin:** Agreed. Yeah. He, and he knows that the bro, the broker, I think is, I'm sensing a little bit of frustration from him on behalf the seller too.

Of course, there're a 

**Athena:** qualified buyer that found financing on a deal that he thought was dead because SBA couldn't finance it. 

**Justin:** Yeah. Like 

**Athena:** that's his paycheck. 

**Justin:** He, and he knows that, and I think he'd like to wipe his hands of this, so, we'll, we'll see. He said, let me go back to the seller state, restate the case, try to work him a little bit.

And I said, look, if he wants to evaluate, he goes, remember, he feels strongly because he knows that this is a million dollar SDE business, which it was two years ago. Now it's more seven 50 ish. And he said, uh, but he, you know, he knows this could be a million dollar business, so that's where his value is placed.

And I go, well, I'm not, I don't buy something that hasn't existed or doesn't exist. Like I'm, I can't buy hopes and dreams, right? So I go, that's exactly what the performance he intended to do. Right? And ensuring we get to that valuation and then I will happily pay him out on that. Um, so [00:32:00] we'll, we'll see what happens.

And, and yeah, he is, he knows, he knows where we sit and I think agrees that this is a little. A peculiar situation. Um, so we'll, we'll find out. 

**Athena:** You the golden ticket. You're his golden ticket for an exit, so 

**Justin:** we'll find out. We'll find out. That's wild. Um, yeah. And then completely, oh, sorry, I, I was just gonna switch.

Yeah. 

**Athena:** Switch. Go for it. 

**Justin:** No, I just, I literally, right before this, got off the call with the, uh, power sports broker and seller. This is the first seller call. Um, yeah. And we really hit it off. He, he, I mean, even to the point where the broker emailed me right after, he goes, man, he loved you. And so I don't know what that means.

We'll find out. Um. I, I've got some questions. I mean, it was more rapport building and you know, we did get into some of the, you know, yeah, analysis of the business, but a lot more to uncover early days. He wants to move fast. I committed to him that if this works out, I would too. To match his timeline, he [00:33:00] says no SBA, he would rather this over every possibility, not go through SBA, I think he was burned on that last go round.

He said it took six months. They, except an LOI, they took six months going back and forth with SBA only for them to deny it at the end, or they didn't get what they needed out of it. So he's burned on SBA and has basically, you know, stricken it from the consideration record. So we'll have to find out what that looks like.

**Gil:** Uh, 

**Justin:** yeah. But that's, that's that. And then I'm putting together some, he's been very forthcoming and transparent. He goes, look, I'll get you my CRM reports. He's like, anything you want directly from the source, I'll, I'll send it right to you. You can see where the inventory moves and how it affects cashflow, seasonality of it all.

I was like, yeah, everything you got, give it over. I'll, I'll look at it. And uh, and then he said, if you got any questions, you could write down all your questions for, uh, like p and l. Assessment, any financial type questions. She goes, I'm gonna send the right to my CPA and she's gonna answer you. So [00:34:00] you get direct access to like, everything.

She's, you know, so he is like, look, I don't want any weird uncovered, like rocks that, or, or covered rocks that, you know, aren't uncovered come the end of this or if we move forward. He goes, so I'd rather you have everything you need. So I like that. It seems like he's pretty open, so, we'll, we'll find out if there's legs there.

**Athena:** Has it, um, changed your temperature towards it at all? I know you're kind, 

**Polly:** barely. 

**Justin:** I like him. I like him a lot. The seller's cool. Yeah, he's actually probably my fa my new favorite seller. He is? Oh yeah, he's a nice guy. He is a family guy. Like he's a straight shooter. He is like, look, no BS, but in a, in an authentic or refreshing way, you know, that kind of thing.

And my kind of, my kind of person. So, um, yeah. Yeah. And uh, so I like him for what that's worth. I mean, I don't know what that speaks for the business, you know, we'll have to find that out. But 

**Athena:** I mean, owners make the business in their own likeness, you know, which is why I like kind of harp on, get to know them, see if you like them, because you're gonna be working for the next 12 to [00:35:00] 24 months, depending on the deal.

So, yeah, that's good. We can get into the specifics of the questions and everything tomorrow, but yeah. 

**Gil:** Um, 

**Athena:** cool movement. I can't wait to hear the, the saga that continues with the roofing. 

**Justin:** Well, we'll find out if he even calls me back. Like he, he, he didn't even warn me he was call. He just randomly called me and I was in a meeting.

I could not take it. And then as soon as I got out, I called him. He is like, I'm, I'm in a meeting myself. He is like, I, I'll try you later this afternoon. But he's also done that and I three days go by and nothing. So who knows. We'll, we'll see. 

**Athena:** Gotcha. Okay, cool. Well, good stuff. Thanks for the updates. Um, just so you all know on Thursday, I don't, you know, have we announced this yet?

Who the guest is gonna, okay, cool. Um, so, uh, somebody that I, um, really respect and enjoy is going to be coming and doing a business valuation, um, uh, expert session with us on Thursday. Um, so he has been doing valuations for I think two. [00:36:00] 20, if not 30 years. Also a wealth manager. So we, we actually are gonna have 'em for two sessions.

The first one is gonna be going through business valuations. So they do business valuations for private buyers. They also do business valuations for SBA. So we're gonna be able to hear from the person that does those valuations for the SBA, um, what they look for, how they make those valuations. He's got a really cool five pillar pillars of business value situation.

Um, also a potentially great resource if there's no SBA involved or you're in an off market situation where you need to put something in front of the seller to justify where the cost is. So that's gonna be a super fun conversation. Um, and then we're gonna bring him back, uh, in September to talk about.

Wealth management and how you can get ahead of that for yourself. Many of you have been in, uh, you know, situations where you haven't had the ability to choose retirement accounts or where you put the, those resources [00:37:00] outside of a W2. So he is gonna be talking about that also. Um, and I'm really excited.

So his name's Eric Boyce. Um, super awesome warm person. Just wants to add value and be a good resource to us. So, um, should be a really fun conversation on Thursday. So please join us for Virus Club if you can. Um, three o'clock and that'll be about an hour and a half. Um, and we'll leave it open for lots of questions for y'all too 'cause I'm sure it'll come up.

And I, I always get really interested to hear. Um, you know, from another supplier to the lenders, like, what are the lenders looking for in these valuations? What, you know, how are they checking the boxes on their side? How are they looking at that? Because when you go through the SBA process, a business valuation has to be done.

Um, in order for them to be able to get the loan and get that guarantee. And obviously the valuation is very different from a Q of E. Um, so we're gonna talk about the differences there too. [00:38:00] So that'll be a super fun one on Thursday. So please join us for that. Um, and I think that's all I have today. So we get seven minutes back in our day.

So thank you all. Um, good stuff. The team is working on some really amazing deals. We've been talking about it, so you'll be seeing some new stuff on all of your dashboards soon also, so that'll be exciting. Um, cool. Thank y'all. Have a great day. Bye. Thank you. Bye. 

Thank you.
