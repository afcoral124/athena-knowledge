# AcquiMatch Buyers Club 06/12/2025

[00:00:00] 

**Athena:** Hello. Hello. Welcome. Hey. Steve's here too. Amazing. Nice to see you. Um, I think a few folks might join in a little bit, but I am so excited for this conversation. So I've known of Elliot pretty much from the point that I came on to ETA. He is fairly famous in these worlds just because of the experience and the realness that he brings to everything that he does.

Um, and luckily was able to finally connect in person, um, earlier, no, it's like, yeah, earlier this year at SM Bash. Um, and we just share a lot of the same philosophies and, and, um, really connected. And I love how he kinds of thinks of deals and also talks of. The difficulties that you're gonna go through as you go through this.

Now he [00:01:00] is a diligence provider, but also extends a lot of support to folks to help them get deals over the line. So he brings that lens of doing diligence, but also what does it take beyond that? And as you know, you all experience in real time, there's a lot more than just getting the numbers right on a deal.

So, um, really delighted. He's here to spend time with us and he's gonna be talking about, okay, QVS done. It's not what you thought. Like now what happens? Right? Like, we're under LOI, things have shifted from when we went into LOI, how do we address this situation? So Elliot, thank you so much for being here.

I won't do the disservice of trying to give your background, but I know you have a extensive and very, um, impressive one and a lot of experience that, um, a lot of folks don't, don't have in this space. 

**Elliot:** Yeah, no, thanks for having me. I'm excited. Um. So I'm Elliot, I'm a kid from Ann Arbor, Michigan. I hope that doesn't kick me off the call.

Uh, [00:02:00] I did engineering undergrad and then, um, won the business school lottery and got into Harvard. Um, and you guys won't be surprised by this, but I wanted to be rich. So I tried my hand to private equity, which was the business of buying businesses, and I realized I was behind a whole bunch of Wall Street dudes.

So I out called everybody and I got one job that I started my, uh, last semester in business school, February. So I was a, um, a working student at Harvard Business School. I'm, I'm sure that's a short list. And, um, I realized that own equity was a lot better than working for other people who did. So I spun out of there with a mentor of mine and we did what was called an independent sponsor thing called Ellsworth Partners.

That's just Smart Wall Street people that have a dollar and a dream. And then when he effectively retired, I started, uh, a self-funded cert. So I sat in the same kind of seat as all you guys. And then, um. I tried to self a certain 2015 before a did acquisition loans. Wow. [00:03:00] Yep. OG. And, um, it didn't work. And so I had these, uh, cool skills and I had to figure out what to do with them.

And I said, oh, these no money down jerks are lying to everybody and they're gonna send some people to the poor house. They start a diligence company to help people save themselves from the malarkey. And so, um, back in 2018, I started Guardian due diligence to do just that. And then last year I started a masterclass to help sort of the same people who, um, if they're smart, will skip some of the fake gurus and actually get educated by somebody who knows what they're talking about.

So that's my background. But I think what's more interesting about me is I'm a deal dude that runs a diligence firm. So I think about stuff in deal terms. I plan on having some fun with the next 90 minutes. So Steve and Gil, I'm gonna be asking questions, talking trash, having fun. So, uh, if you guys are with that, let's go.

Yeah,[00:04:00] 

let me share these basic, basic slides I've made. We're gonna have more conversations and slide reading, I promise you.

Alright, can you guys see this? Cool. All right. So, um, Athena gave me some, some coaching tips and said I should talk about this, uh, to be most relevant. So what the heck happens when your QOE comes back different than the sim, which never happens? 'cause the broker's always a hundred percent right and all the correct information's in the sim.

So before I even get started, I know there's gonna be people who listen to this later, but since you're here, we get to focus this on you. Um, I. Have you guys been under LOI yet on a deal, Gil? I have gotten close. Okay. Number two, number one, loser. [00:05:00] Yeah, you probably got two or three more losers, man. And then, then you slam dunk the thing, so just you keep running through the losers.

Um, all right, so one person has been through, um, a signed letter of intent and one that's that's tried. So I'll, I'll focus my attention on that and we'll hop into sort of what happens when things don't go your way. 

**Athena:** We, we also have Chris here who literally just signed an LOI yesterday, so he is about to go through the next steps.

**Elliot:** Ah, what's up Chris? Hey, how's it going? All Thank you for doing this, Elliot. Pretty good. Yeah. Well, this won't happen to you. Yeah. That your, the system that you probably read is a hundred percent correct and you got the greatest. In the, so you can just go to sleep off 

**Athena:** market. It's an off market one, so, yeah.

**Elliot:** All right, well then we're gonna have a bit more fun. All right, so just so you know where we're going. Um, common deal [00:06:00] killers, what do you do when the brokers, uh, abandoning the butt, handling big gaps in revenue, margins, all of that, how you retrade? Um, I think people do this really poorly. So I'm gonna walk you through what I think is like the bare minimum steps that retrade how to manage the conversations, uh, seller and broker.

Um, how buyers lose credibility and how to get it back. What you see most often as an advisor with first time buyers and what they miss. And then some examples of deal adjustments versus deal killers. So I, I call 'em, uh, deal breakers. And then like unsavory stuff, like a mosquito in your bedroom on vacation, like you ain't going home.

You just gotta swap that mosquito. All right. So common deal killers post LOI. Um, this year has been crazy, so people yell at me when I post this on LinkedIn, but I looked it up this weekend. 46% of the deals I [00:07:00] worked on this year had a material difference and the deal relative to either the sim or the expectation that rendered it effectively dead.

Typically when stuff is like 15 or 20% off, you can kind of retrade. If it's bigger than that, it's tough. And here are some of the things that came up most often. Now, I'll admit, uh, I get some tougher deals, so I think people come to me when deals are wonkier. So I think my dataset is skewed a bit, and that's honest.

Elliot, keeping it real with you. I don't think it's necessarily representative of the whole thing, but I also wanted you to kind of have a sense that it's, it's probably not 0% either. So. One time projects. So one of the big deals I worked on this year had, it was a construction related business that did small jobs, call it like a hundred thousand dollars or less, but they had two jobs that were over a half million bucks in the trailing 12 month period that totally changed the way the business [00:08:00] operated, but also changed the profit characteristics of it and they weren't gonna continue.

And so as much as the, the EBITDA on a trail 12 month basis fit, you were experiencing a business in the recent history that was nothing like the historical context of the business, that would be nothing like what you were buying. And so that kind of threw it off. Um, and then let's, let's be honest, small business financials are wonky.

No one in a small business over invest in like their controller or their CPA. Um. You will seldom see cash basis, financials or accrual. You'll see accrual ish, cash ish. And so what people are doing is they're trying to finagle the two to get the best EBITDA in the past trail and 12 month period. And they're, they're, they're, they're cherry picking, messed up stuff.

And although it's not a one time project, it almost is like selling the business is the [00:09:00] one time project and they're playing around with the number. Another one is, uh, inventory not tracked. Now most people are like, well, but that's a balance sheet item, man. It doesn't matter. Oh, no, no, no, no, no. Cost of good sold includes basically inventory versus the cost of good sold.

And so both from a gross margin perspective and from an EBITDA perspective, poor inventory controls, whenever you hear that, you should think profit margin, unsure. Um, and you can go through the whole diligence process. The bank will underwrite this deal 'cause they're not gonna spend that much time on it either.

You can still go to the poor house. So that's one that happens. Work in progress. All right, this is my little pop quiz. Gil. Chris, uh, Steve, is it there? Anybody know what work in progress is?

**Chris:** Isn't this the bridge between cash accounting? Oh, or for people that use [00:10:00] cash accounting, they keep track of those projects. That might be multi-year, but something along those lines. It's been a while since, 

**Elliot:** no, really close. So you're right. 'cause in accrual accounting in any month, you would have the proper cost and revenues accounted for appropriately on the balance sheet and the income statement.

So when people say there's, uh, accrual financials and they don't, and they, and, and, and they don't have sort of prepaids and all those kind of things, the balance sheet, you. Work in progress is think about a, a business that does six month projects and you're gonna buy it April 1st, 2026. Well, there's 10 projects that are in progress.

Now that sounds like, oh, that's just a throwaway, but I was a CFO of a telecom construction business. And, and here's where it gets wonky. So your general manager who gets paid on 80% completion of deals is telling you all 10 deals are 80% complete. [00:11:00] You can't get paid on any of the deals until the customer walks the deals, walks the jobs, and says they're good.

And then you paid out people every single week expecting them to be 80% done. But you actually don't know because nobody sends you like a email update. Like, Hey, all 10 jobs are 80% done. So what ends up happening is you go walk a job and it's 40% done. Another one is 20% done. So now you realize the general manager was either misrepresenting the truth or incompetent.

You paid out 80% of the cost, so you only have 20% of the cost to cover 80% of the work. And so that's a work in progress issue that comes up quite often. Now, I may have gotten screwed up. Is my screen still being shared or did I kill that when I expanded the pictures? 

**Athena:** No, you're good. I'm seeing it. 

**Elliot:** Okay. All, so let me see.

Now I gotta figure something. Hold on guys. Let me [00:12:00] stop and then bring it back up. I wanna see your guys faces. So I threw it up and now I know how to do this on uh, Google, but uh, I zoom and don't do as much. All right, so then lemme go back out. Share.

All right, is my slide back? 

**Athena:** Yep, we can see it. 

**Elliot:** All right. Oh, and then my favorite seller works 10 hours a week. Uh, and you go do your half day visit, and they look like they only work 10 hours a week, but you have no idea. So these are common deal killers. Uh, I'll give an example of, um, the settlement works 10 hours a week and why it matters.

I had a client who used me for the first QOE and didn't wanna pay me the second time, so used somebody cheaper and then pulled me in like, [00:13:00] Hey, Elliot, I want, I want you on my board to help grow the business. Well, the seller had told him that he worked 10 hours in the business. The business did about a quarter million dollars of SDE.

Well, not only did the seller not work 10 hours in the business, they worked 24 7 dispatch invoicing, and were the general manager. So by the time my client rehired international talent to cover that one seller's position, he had bought a break even business for over a million bucks. So these are things that kill the deal, Gil.

I, I see your face twisted up. You gonna stop doing deals now? I hope. Now Athena's not gonna have me back if you, if you quit mid presentation, you're still away from this time. No, I just, 

**Gil:** uh, I've seen this line in many sims. 

**Elliot:** Yes. It's um, it's one that you have to be crafty to check. So this is when the deal guy on top of the QOE guy [00:14:00] kind of comes into place.

This is one where you need to go spend two business days with the seller. And I don't care what anybody tells you about it being inconvenient, about the leg, hurting about their deacon in the church. If, if you want me to believe that they only work 10 hours, then they should have no issue pushing those 10 hours into three days and not five.

And I want a two day offsite. And that's how you call BS on people who. A week.

All right. So when the broker's aggressive being a pain in the butt, all kinds of craziness. So, um, Gil, you've been under l lo I, how was, was it a broker deal or proprietary? 

**Gil:** It was a broker deal and the broker was beyond a pain 

**Elliot:** in the ass. Give me the two worst pain in the ass things that you experienced.

**Gil:** Uh, first of all, his [00:15:00] attitude and his tone of voice. When he talked to me, he actually raised his voice. Uh, and the second thing is him trying to convince me of things that are simply weren't true. 

**Elliot:** That's like broker one-on-one right there. That's, that's, that's, that's in their training module. So how do you get around it?

So the first example I use is, you wanna go see the CEO of Coca-Cola and their admin is a asshole. You just suck it up, right? Because you're not gonna cancel your meeting with the CEO. So number one is your deals with the seller. The broker is a temporary nuisance, but let me double click on that. Um, so six months before you meet your seller, the broker sold the seller on selling their business with this broker.

So they set out all the typically mediocre brokers that are out in the world. They pick this mediocre bloke to do their deal. So now [00:16:00] they've osculated their deal knowledge to this dude. Now he shows up day one, trying to earn his salary, trying to get the purchase price as high as possible. And, and really the broker's in this weird position now, Chris, yo Steve, think about this.

The broker is a salesperson. They're in between a person that's got a, call it a. $5 million enterprise value business or a rich person that's an entrepreneur, and then you're about to go bring a $5 million Brinks truck to go take this $5 million owner out, they've never seen or applied for $5 million in their life.

So they're in between two people who are more formidable than them, and a lot of the nervousness you guys get from them is a direct result of them trying to figure out. So everything that comes up, can I push my client or is Chris easier to push? Because if Chris is easier to push, I'm pushing [00:17:00] Chris now Chris shows me that he is more formidable than I expected.

Now I have to go push my client. So that's oftentimes what's going on here. Brokers often say things that the seller doesn't even know. So I have a client I've been working with for like six months and every month she calls me about some crazy town thing the broker said, and I have to keep reminding her like.

Call your seller. Even if your seller said it, make your seller say it to you because you can, you can say things to the broker that you couldn't say to the seller. Seller can say things to the broker they can't say to you. Make 'em say it to you also. And, uh, at the end of, back me up here, or call me crazy.

So, day one, post LOI, the broker works for his client or her client, right? 30 days before that check comes through. Who does the broker work for? 

**Athena:** The buyer. [00:18:00] 

**Elliot:** The buyer. So if your broker is an asshole, just know that 30 days before close, they actually work for you because they work for the deal and they work to get paid.

So the same jerk will be eating outta your hands once you do some. Kind of formulate things that you have to do anyway. So you gotta do some sort of diligence. You gotta raise the capital, you have to negotiate the purchase agreement. So if you just put your head down and do work, by the time stuff really gets tough when you're close to closed, the broker's working for you.

But let me stop. You guys have either heard of, experienced, or may be concerned about dealing with some broker craziness. Let's talk about some real scenarios, 'cause I think this will be helpful. And Chris, you're, you're, you're now buyer and broker because you're on the proprietary deal[00:19:00] 

**Chris:** that that's correct. Um, do you want, sorry, I didn't, do you want Sorry. Do you want, did you want me to share a real life scenario there? Does I understand? Correct. 

**Elliot:** Yeah. I, I, I wanted to, to talk about some real life scenarios of crazy broker one, but. 

**Chris:** I mean, in my case, because it was off market and it was brought by by the team, um, I didn't get as much craziness of a third party being involved.

But a lot of what you're saying here, I've had even till yesterday and we'll continue to employ. So a lot of it is just being patient. Um, so I signed my f like version of an NDA February mid, early, early to mid Feb. It was only until yesterday that I got them, you know, after multiple hoops. And that's like being, you know, explaining non-binding, right.

Explaining [00:20:00] that all that this OI was doing was exclusivity, uh, you know, non-disclosure and then our, you know, certain other provisions, but nothing, right. That everything else we could figure out together. Um, having, I guess. Foresight, I don't know if it's the right word, but just almost like a chest move and being able to see beyond the immediate challenge and not just letting it go.

So I guess the most, I don't know if it applies apples to apples to this, um, but, um, things that I've had to navigate is, so this deal is a 90 plus year old warehouse distributor of auto parts, and they have, uh, multiple warehouses, so six locations. Third, I'm dealing with the third generation. And, uh, to keep it short, that means that I'm dealing with a seller, a power of attorney for a seller who's in hospice, [00:21:00] and then the real estate component has.

Six shareholders. He represents them all. But there's, so I've had to navigate then pushing back on my seller note, have to navigate the president now who's ready to sign, but concerned about his health insurance. I've had to navigate several things. What I think is the flip side is this LOI has a lot of work done that I think will smooth the purchase or the definitive agreement, right.

The final contract that we do. So I had to bite my words. I've had to concede, we went from an asset sale to a stock sale, means I'm gonna probably have to do an f reorg afterwards. So, so it's a lot of like playing chess is what I'm saying. But they weren't assholes, I think, you know, just to, they, they weren't, what I feel we did right was I took a gamble and I said, well, if I lose 1200 bucks, I, I live in Barcelona, keep us hours, I keep some, I took a gamble and I flew to them [00:22:00] and spent.

A whole day with them at the site, well, at their main office we ended the day with beers. We, so we built a lot of rapport and connection and I think that's what's carried us through all this, like almost five months that we've been, you know, dealing in, well, two months of actual, like we, Tina and I were talking about it yesterday since I submitted and it's been five weeks of active negotiations, back and forth, back and forth.

So I dunno if that applies to your point, apple to apple, but that's been my experience of being like patient and sort of being on both sides of the, of the equation. 

**Elliot:** Well, it does because, so on a broker deal, what you might not recognize as a buyer is that that asshole broker did all that work.

**Chris:** Fair enough. So I 

**Elliot:** had to, so when they don't respond to you in the way that you, like, when they, uh, sent the wrong version of the letter of intent. When the, the seller berates you or something [00:23:00] that the broker could have saved you from. Just recognize that some of the work you just did with broker work, right?

And it's worth it to you because you'll buy a million dollar business. But as as harsh as I can be on brokers, I also know that deals don't get done without those jobs getting done. And so I think it's also wise to give people grace in that regard because you know, they gotta deal with the six people and the power of attorney.

And when you get a marked up LOI that looks all crazy, they may have taken half the markups out. So that's one thing. The other thing is

when you show up day one with the letter of intent, nobody thinks you have any money. As a self-funded searcher, there's no big Warren Buffet fund behind you. Everyone knows you're gonna get 90% of the capital from the bank. I know in Barcelona it's different, and unless you're a US citizen living over there, my Canadian customers have different stuff too.

But like everyone knows the [00:24:00] bank's gonna be a big part of your transaction. And so what happens is a lot of times you haven't earned enough trust with the seller or the broker to be real yet. And so some of the things you conceded, Chris, I would argue, once you get to that 30 days before you close and like they're like a month away from the Brinks truck, you're gonna get some leverage back.

**Chris:** Good. No. Yeah. And then ultimately, I mean, it is, it's a healthy business. So I, uh, I always keep like, keep your eye on the prize. That's what I've been doing. Right? So keeping the eye on the prize and uh, you know, very much moving. I'm a US citizen, so moving back to the us um, it's almost like I never left 'cause I still work.

Yeah. But, but yeah. 

**Elliot:** So. How do you handle material diligence issues? So God forbid you have one, but if you have one, it doesn't mean that the deal goes compliant. And when I think about material diligence issues, I think about [00:25:00] something that affects either ebitda, so therefore purchase price or your risk assessment by over 20%, 15, 25.

You know, I say 20. I recommend that you all, and Chris, you're in this right now, so this is like a, a timely recommendation. And Athena may have already given to you like list your absolute deal breakers first because I found in the heat of a negotiation when you're about to fly from Barcelona to Jersey to go spend a day with the sellers and right before you get on a plane, you hear something that's significant, but you don't know if it's a deal breaker, unsavory.

20% of purchase price or risk assessment or 10. It's very hard in that moment with all the other stuff going on for you to know. But if you start from day one saying, Hey, I have five deal breakers here, they are defined very [00:26:00] explicitly. And so any new piece of data can come in and either hits that list and so therefore you stop or it doesn't, and it's on the unsavory list, and that allows you to be more objective.

You guys may be better at me, better than me at functioning with big data swings in the midst of negotiations. I was never good enough, so I always kept my list, and then I was very adamant and I pushed my clients a lot on, is this a deal breaker or is this the mosquito in the in the bedroom? On vacation later as you go to see the CEO, you're not gonna cancel the meeting like, oh my God, my nose.

So the reason I bring this up is that that thing about the seller working 10 hours in the business, that might not be a deal breaker for you, but customer concentration over [00:27:00] 35% might be. And when you find out the customer one and two are owned by the same parent that could kill your deal on a Tuesday, rightfully so.

But had you not listed that that was a deal breaker, you might oscillate in your mind for days or negotiate with less rigor than you should. Because here's the thing, I might have a deal breaker on my list, but if you cut the purchase price in half, it might not be a deal breaker anymore. If I need to negotiate with you to get half off, or I'm gonna walk and I try to start with, well, maybe 20% isn't, uh, maybe 30.

If you're gonna walk, if the thing isn't cut in half, you should kind of know that that's how significant it's Gil. Steve, am I still tracking? I haven't put anybody to sleep. You haven't? I don't. We got poll on here too. All right, cool. Um, [00:28:00] this is one that if it wasn't so boring, I'd probably talk about it more on social.

Um, but people do ret trades Ably. Ably. Let me give you an example. So a lot like 90% of my clients are first time buyers. I was a first time buyer 10 years ago, so. You say, Hey, it's a million dollars of ebitda. My multiple's four, I find out EBITDA is off by 20%. That's 800,000. That's 800,000 times four.

That's 3.2 million. That's obvious to everybody. Hey, broker, since the EBITDA is off by 200,000, I need to adjust my price to 3.2. Tell the seller to understand that and we're gonna get on a call tomorrow after he understands it. Not gonna work. There is a three to five step [00:29:00] process for a retrade, and it's no different than any Ts communication.

Like if your kid wanted to go to Michigan and all they got into is Michigan State, like it's not just gonna be one dinner and a couple of ribs, it's gonna get that sort of smoothed over. It's gonna take a while. So the way that you do, it's the first thing is you identify the material difference that you found specifically, but not overexplaining.

You don't allow the broker to put, well, what are you gonna do with it? I don't know yet. I brought it to you before. I know what I'm gonna do with it, but I wanted you and I to know, because success is gonna be all of us thinking about what we can do and then figuring out what we should do. What that says is you need to go ask your client all the ways they're willing to give up something.

So I can pick which way I want, but I don't wanna accept my position because all you're gonna do is disagree with it. So I found something that nobody likes. What is [00:30:00] your client, the seller willing to do? Second one, validate. Hey, broker, I believe the seller told me that they're selling this biz for a fair price.

I thought you only took sellers that sell for fair prices. So we're gonna do this deal at a fair price, right? And what you're trying to do there is head off. The price hasn't changed. Deal with it. You're trying to get someone to double down on a promise they made or a level of reasonableness because you're, you're setting up for a retrade and you're communicating it without saying it.

Then you gotta wait, shut up, not do anything for a couple days. So the seller can yell at the broker, tell him he doesn't care. He is been doing this 30 years, you know, one year, 20% difference in ebitda, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. And then wake up a couple days later and say, I guess that $5 million Brinks truck isn't happening if I don't do [00:31:00] something.

So I actually gotta make some concessions. That's the wait part. While you wait, you need to consider two to three ways that you're willing to move to get back to normal. So, hey, maybe I'll take 10% off a purchase price and add 10% to the seller note, and, and that gets me there. Or, uh, all right, I'll pay you out for the business full price, but I need a.

30% reduction in the real estate purchase, or I need, uh, a 15 year seller note. Like, think about all the ways you can get back to normal, given what you need. And then when the seller comes back, I should have been back, not back. I'll update that. Um, you see what ways they came up with. You have your ways in the back of your head, and if you go through this process patiently, you will have forced the seller to consider not selling to you, not [00:32:00] conceding, or how they can concede before you get on a call where you have to get yelled at.

That seller has probably yelled at their broker, yelled at themselves, yelled in the mirror, yelled at their general manager. You don't want to hear all of that. You just wanna get to a solution. Now, all of you guys are business professionals. How does that sound relative to how you might have pursued a retrade or has anybody had to do a retrade has.

**Gil:** Yeah, I did, um, did not follow this process specifically. Um, I communicated with the broker. Uh, I jumped to, I presented him with stage with, with the two to three ways to get back to normal from my perspective. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Uh, and, uh, of course, he shot them down and said, I'm not doing, uh, below x, we're not doing this.

This deal is not a deal. Um, they, a few of things [00:33:00] happened, but, uh, that's, that's where it ended. I believe if I would've followed this process, it went, might've been a bit different because it would've been more on the seller's hand and in front of the sellers as opposed to in front of the broker.

**Elliot:** Forgive the reference, but I like giving people their monkey back. Their business did less ebitda, not your business. It's actually not your problem to solve. It should be theirs. I also, because I've lost money, have tried to figure out better rules, Gil. So this is just me losing a couple years ago and figuring out how did I lose again.

Um, a lot of times I, in processes and when I recommend, it's like the, the combination of like running full speed, right? And then, and then like jogging or walking on the same race. It's like, do I wake up today and run full speed? Like I'm a running back trying to get to the end zone, or do I [00:34:00] walk like the old grandpa who's like never gonna get to the bus station in time?

And, and sometimes in, given the, the, the pace of the deal, either one can be the best pass. So for instance, the thing that typically in this retrade set of steps does the most work for you. Is not having a solution for the broker. When you tell 'em that something's off and something needs to be done, well, what do you wanna do about it, Elliot?

I don't know yet.

I don't know. I just found out last night it's fresh. I gotta think about some ways, but I, I don't know, because now they have to go tell their client that something materially off has been presented. Their client, the seller who's probably a first time seller is gonna say all the, I won't, I won't, I won't.

Well, the broker doesn't get paid. If the seller, I won't. So now the broker's working your angle with their client [00:35:00] to get their check in rooms. You're only have to show up into, just because you didn't offer a solution right away. Now this isn't gonna be a hundred percent foolproof, and if Athena recommends a different process, she, she's way closer to the deal than I am.

But this is one way to kind of get through it that I've seen. At least the logic of it helps people think about, you're not gonna do all this in a day. You gotta give the seller a chance to walk back their craziness, and you might have to get yelled at once. So I've been on phone calls and my deals, and I've been on phone calls with clients where the seller and broker or one of the other will yell, great, call him.

You know, shady son of, son of a gun. Let 'em get that energy off. When you're talking about three, four, 5 million bucks, people want to get paid so they'll, they'll come back to the table. If you exhibit enough patience, what ends up happening, a lot of times in Athena, I'm sure you've seen this the first time buyers, when you're in deal [00:36:00] heat, you talk over yourself, you negotiate with yourself, oh, I need 10% off the purchase price.

Well, hey, broker, I can probably do eight in a slightly bigger seller though. Well, five and five. Well, how can we get this back to normal? And then by that point, nobody respects you anymore. And they're like, you're gonna take nothing because you, you negotiated with yourself. So I don't wanna overtalk this, but this is one that I think a lot of first time buyers get wrong.

**Athena:** I, I'd love to, um, give, like, Gil, if you're okay, there's, there's some other variables that, that this broker did in particular and like, that was really working against Gil and I'd love to get your take on it, Elliot. But, um, Gil, are you okay with me just talking about Yeah, of course. Couple, yeah. So 

**Gil:** go 

**Athena:** for it.

Yes. So I don't know if you've had experience with Generational Elliot, but this was Yeah. Um, so this, uh, there [00:37:00] was a bunch of add-backs in there that the broker had or was in, in the sim, these add-backs that inflated the STE e and both like, um. A couple lenders took issue with it. Well, this broker introduced Gill to his lenders, like pre LOI.

So you know, he is double dipping obviously. Yeah. And then one lender like wrote a term sheet based on the add backs. Right. And it was, he was clearly a good buddy with the broker and Gil never gave him permission to go to the broker and tell him the terms of the deal or share the term. But the, the lender did.

So the broker had validation that it could be funded with all of those add-backs. Yeah, which was really working against Gil in this regard because had, had Gil not worked with the brokers or had the lender not shared these details, Gil had it from multiple sources at the end. Like, you know, his add-backs, like building [00:38:00] repairs and uh, staff bonuses and things like that, that it's like he's gonna need to bonus the team.

Right. And commissions to salespeople and stuff. So, um, so when it came to light, the broker berated Gil and also kept blindsiding Gil and like calling him and catching him off guard. And when Gil was trying to like, move things to email, he still insisted on phone calls and stuff. So, um, there that's a bit more color.

I think Gil handled it exceptionally well. He had a really great relationship with the seller, but the broker was like a total bully nightmare on this and rejected that. These were not legitimate add-backs, so it was really hard to move forward from that. 

**Elliot:** So Athena, I'm asked for a little grace, but I'm gonna share how I've lost money and, and, and why I put my foot down with clients when things can be really easy to acquiesce to at the beginning, but can put you in a position where you can't win.[00:39:00] 

Even when my clients can't get out of using the broker's lender, I always recommend a parallel process at least two. Now, if Lisa Forres heard that, she might yell at me, but she'd understand where I'm coming from because lenders trade term sheets and, and, and frankly the lender that we talk about as a salesperson at the bank, they actually don't make credit decisions.

So they may tell you this term sheet is solid, and then the credit committee gets it and it ain't. But that might not happen until another 30 days. And by that point, your like renegotiation timeline has already lapsed. So one of the things that I think is messy is that deals are kind of like a poker table.

Like we'd all love to be transparent, but it's, it's, it's a big game alive. [00:40:00] So I've seen where clients had to sort of use the brokers lender, but go call Livo, go call byline, go call somebody else, get another term sheet, get another opinion. Bill 

**Athena:** deal, spoke to four lenders actually. So, and he got a term sheet from another one that he wanted to work with that rejected the add back.

So that's where it came up because he wanted to use a lender that he trusted, rejected the add backs, like we didn't agree with the add backs, but the broker knew that. His lender that Gil had also talked to was offering a term sheet with those add backs still in the SDE. 

**Elliot:** So in that case.

If a sucker's gonna come behind you and overpay, there's nothing you can do about it except not waste your money. Right? Um, and it stinks 'cause Athena, we've had another client that we both work with [00:41:00] where the answer was just gotta stop and just let them either come back to you or leave. Because

the financial acumen of the average broker, and I say this publicly and I still handshake brokers, I, I I mixed bag and they talk crap about me too. Um, the, the natural acumen of them is not that high. So they think term sheet deal done paycheck. I'll give this to the 10 people behind you. Here's the thing, gi in today's environment, they're gonna find a sucker.

I hate to say it, but these folks aren't doing quality of earnings. They're doing ai, quality of earnings. They're Heather and Justin is recommended. A $4,000 proof of Cash's, the only diligence you need to do, they're gonna find a sucker. That doesn't mean that sucker should be you when the brokers, yeah, he was overly committed.

It's [00:42:00] like crazy. 

**Gil:** Go ahead. He was questioning my decision to do a QV. He said, why doing a QV for a deal this small and it's a few million dollar deal. You know? And, uh, I, I, I just didn't, yeah, he was questioning that 

**Elliot:** because it ain't his money. 

**Gil:** Money, yeah. 

**Elliot:** Money. He ain't never put $3 million on the line.

Nowhere.

So one of the false equivalencies that happens a lot is even sellers will play into this, is like, well, I didn't need this much information when I started it or when I paid. $300 for this thing. 30 years ago, I didn't need this much information. They've never made a single day, $3 million bet. And I remind them of that every single day.

I also remind them, if you like the deal so gosh darn much, why don't you buy it for that crazy price? Using that crazy term sheet. Now, sometimes people will say, I'm too flippant, [00:43:00] but when it comes to my money, I like laughing and having a good time. You guys can tell that I don't play with my money. I'm okay with another sucker coming behind me and, um, doing something.

I wouldn't. I also remind the broker, you may go through two or three more people that are diligent like me before you find a sucker and that'll put your money out. 18 months, I'm gonna get it to you in 60 days. You gotta make a decision, but buddy, maybe you find a sucker. Maybe it takes two years. Your client may fire you.

This lender may change their tune when they get to credit committee. I try to put as much doubt in and everything, but Gil, here's the reality man. Like some, some games you don't wanna win. Like, I'm not sure you wanted to win that game.

**Gil:** I was okay with Lucy again. There 

**Elliot:** we go. 

**Athena:** Which I think is a, that's, that's an even more noble decision, right? [00:44:00] It's like he was pot and invested, but he made a decision based on like, there was just too many things that weren't resonating and feeling good about it. So the broker was a, you know, like total asshole.

He even threatened him to blacklist from all future deals for raising questionable ad box, which I suspect the broker knew all along because he was questioning the Q of E from the get and pushing Gil on his lenders from the get right and like. Shame realiz sharing that information. 

**Elliot:** So something else, like I've learned over the years by losing money and time, I don't even believe what anybody says anymore.

Like again, if I'm in a Liar's Poker and everybody's lying, I literally, and I have these big old life-sized post-it notes. So when I'm on the road, I can still whiteboard and I just put down, if the [00:45:00] broker was a honest, reasonable person, here's the things they would do. If they were a dishonest cheat, here's the things they would do.

And then I evaluate every action is the closer to the honest person or the cheat side. And so each thing, each data point, well, you know, all of a sudden I've got eight data points, pushes them real close to an honest person or real close to a liar. Then I don't have to listen as much to their words because I've evaluated their action.

And that goes for broker, seller, lender, all shoot, business, partner, friend, like at a certain point, um, because there's so much wonkiness, Gil. 'cause you may get a broker just like this guy next time and have sort of some better tactics to, to push him a bit more and get a deal done. What you can't control is the honorability of a given broker and the deals are more important.

[00:46:00] Evaluation. So this is one way that I've been able to work. And then, and then, you know, broker says, oh, I've been doing this for 20 years. It's like, well, help me understand on these seven times what what you did was something that was self-interested that could have got me in trouble. I'm supposed to believe your honorable statement today.

And again, none of this is silver bullet. I'm just giving you the best stuff that I've learned around 15 years of doing it. 

**Athena:** I think. I think there's an element of, you know, when you're a first time buyer and you find a deal you like. There's the fear of losing it. And, and that puts you automatically at a, at a hard place to negotiate.

And the brokers like, especially bullies like that, they sniff it out and they, they lay into it, right? 

**Elliot:** Yeah. 

**Athena:** Um, so it's really hard and a delicate dance to play between, I will [00:47:00] walk right when you're really excited about a deal and you're like, I want this to go through. So you might make concessions or negotiate from a different place, which is completely understandable.

It's kind of hard to take this position like Elliot's saying, and it's like after, and it is why the negotiation practice and stuff like that is so important. 'cause it, it, it sucks when you love something and you want, you just wanna make it work and you're on the other end of the table from somebody that's doing that sort of thing and like playing the role of like.

Holding them accountable and I'm willing to walk. When you inside, you don't feel that way, you know, like you want it to go 

**Elliot:** through. So 

**Athena:** I, it reminds me of 

**Elliot:** poker quite a bit. It's like, you might not wanna put that next bet out, but if I'm gonna win tonight, I gotta check and see if he's bluffing or she's bluffing and it's gonna suck 'cause I'm gonna lose some money and the odds aren't with me.

But I, I gotta keep this person honest. I gotta make [00:48:00] sure that they know, I'll check them. And, and, and here's something else. This is also why I don't like debt brokers who recommend quality of earnings providers because everybody gets paid on good deals and bad. And I've had to walk four or five first time buyers in deal heat off the ledge this year.

And it's heavy on me, right? Yeah. I got paid for it. Think about that 30-year-old that just quit his job. He is working off his wife's salary. They just moved from Florida to San Francisco to be close to her job. They just asked her to come back to the office and he's probably told her, this is the grand spanking new thing.

We're gonna be rich baby. And I'm like, I have five or six ways I think your seller's lying. Um, I don't believe the numbers at all. And although the tax returns would support lending, you'll, you'll be in the bankruptcy line, in my opinion, if you do [00:49:00] this, this is the bottom 10% of all the deals I've seen in 15 years.

But a lot of people won't put it to you like that. But I think that's a good balance for first time buyers is sort of having advisors who are like, Hey, I'm only interested in your long-term success. If you do a bad deal, you're gonna hate me. I know if my client does a bad deal, they're gonna hate me. So I gotta play a long game, even when it's temporarily painful.

For instance, I have a buddy, he runs a podcast in the SMB space. Not one of the main ones, but he runs one. I've done two QEs for him and I've had to walk him off the ledge like, baby, baby, please, please don't do this. The second time he didn't talk to me for three months. We talked every week before that for two years, and I was a little bit bummed, but I was like, you know what?

You did the right thing. That deal was hot trash. [00:50:00] He'll get over it. Month four, we start talking again. And it confirmed to me I had a choice. I can either tell him what's real and he won't talk to me for three months, but we'll have the rest of our life to talk or I don't. 'cause I'm too weak sauce to tell him we'll keep talking for those three weeks.

He'll be in a terrible deal. He'll blame me and we won't talk for the rest of our lives.

Here's a couple other people in the retrade that people don't always consider that you gotta watch out for. So let's see. Chris, you're in it. So these people are coming up. Is he still on? Yeah, here. I'm here. I'm here. All right, man. So have you had to deal with your sellers CPA or their lawyers yet? 

**Chris:** Not, not me, but anything I send gets reviewed by their [00:51:00] lawyer.

They have a, so I, I, on Adinas advice, I tested them early in the sense that I sort of brought up, Hey, you have a family lawyer, um, you know, this is, these transactions carry, you know, different steps than maybe what he's used to. I. Um, I can connect you with people that can make recommendations in case you wanted to explore that.

Um, and it seems like this person has handled m and a deals and they trust him and he's advised them on in the past when they've explored being acquired by a strategic, so, so, you know, x number of, you know, multiples of their size. Um, so anything I've said has been reviewed by, by their lawyers so they don't get a red line.

That's been good. Uh, we just talk it out in a Zoom call and I, and I report it, [00:52:00] but ultimately, yeah, I've been really, I've been negotiating with them and their, their lawyer the whole time. Um, an example that I guess to bring it to life is. Mean strategically, but also knowing what it means for the real estate.

I asked, and I put it in the, in the, in the real estate section of the LOI first right of refusal for, for any of the remaining properties. And, uh, for them they felt like, oh, that's open-ended. That's very strategic of you. But that might lock us down as might see, you know, I sort of get the point, but ultimately all they have to do to, to meet that obligation is, is bring it to me.

And if I can't meet those terms, they can sell it. Right? Yep. So for them, that was like a big point for their lawyer as well. Um, and they then rebutted with five years, which seemed reasonable to me. [00:53:00] And then I think their lawyers still didn't like it and they, they sort of, 

**Elliot:** uh, uh, 

**Chris:** we went down to three. I'm like, look, I'll get, this is one of those examples of like.

I didn't show my head at first, but I'm like this, we're negotiating the wrong thing. What I care more is the option to purchase that we're gonna negotiate or, or that I want us to get into, you know, um, later. So, um, the CPA, I don't, I know they have a somewhat, but I, the power of attorney gentlemen is the treasurer for the company, so I've been dealing with him a lot.

But, um, no, haven't met the CPA, the formal CPA yet. Lawyer has definitely been in everything that I do. It has definitely thrown a wrench in every, in, in a lot of like conversations that we've had. 

**Elliot:** So when I say last kiss, do you guys understand what I'm saying? I try to have fun with language. Alright, perfect.

[00:54:00] So is that 

**Chris:** like a last blessing? Like, but he needs to, to have the last say, 

**Elliot:** oh no, this is more fun. This is like a slow dancing in a burning room. You're not gonna keep their CPA. So this is the last invoice that CPA gets to send. You're not gonna keep their lawyer. This is the last invoice their lawyer gets to send the deeper.

So what here and how I use it is the seller may have been aligned with this person for 20 years. In your case, for three generation, right, Chris? Mm-hmm. But this may be the first time they're not aligned to me. Oftentimes don't notice it because they're not deal professionals. And so oftentimes I have to remind sellers, I'm on a deal right now where dude in Alabama, salt of the earth, great dude, he's bionic business from I think some honorable folks, but their CPA is acting as a broker.

And I had to call my client [00:55:00] yesterday. I'm like, this lady's holding up that she knows this is her last invoice. And how are you gonna tell your sellers. Because the next time they call you and say that I'm unreasonable, you're QOE in and I can't help you after that. So if we're not active now in putting this information out there, then in a week they're gonna call you and say, I'm crazy and there's nothing I can do.

So the thing I often men do, you can never tell a seller what to do, but I ask them, Hey, is this the last invoice your uh, CP is gonna be able to send you?

Do you think that's clouding their judgment at all? Because they're really being cantankerous around a couple things, and I'm just trying to bring a Brinks truck to your front door in 30 to 60 days. But it seems like everything's a catastrophic issue. I don't know, just, just a thought that's typically enough to tip [00:56:00] a smart person off that, oh, you're right.

I gotta deal with you to get a big old paycheck and I'm sending this person. Their last check in 30 days.

I've seen that turnaround. In fact, I just had a conversation yesterday. Guess what I have in my inbox? A whole bunch of data. 24 hours, 48 hours. It typically doesn't take that long. Why? 'cause people don't like playing around with three, $4 million checks. Right? And once they realize somebody, they're paying two, $300 an hour is impeding a three $4 million transaction, it doesn't take a top tier entrepreneur salary to figure out what to do.

Lawyers do the same thing. So when your purchase agreement, when it, I typically give people like one or one, one and a half standard deviations of craziness. And then I ask him, is this lawyer playing to keep you as a client and keep you poor?

I [00:57:00] just ask it once. 

**Chris:** Hmm. That might come in handy. 

**Elliot:** I thought, I thought you might be able to use 

**Chris:** that. Thank you for, uh, yeah, know that's given 

**Athena:** me a 

**Chris:** lot to think. 

**Athena:** Thank you for sharing that. That's gold. Elliot. I'm taking that one away too, because it's like incentives, right? We talk about incentive alignment from the advisor side and why I hate the percentage based on the buy side and those sorts of things.

Um, you know, the, the incentives, like that's, they're losing that client when this deal closes. Like that's a really astute point and an important one and something that everybody can take away from this. So love it. 

**Elliot:** And all you have to do is ask the seller wants. Mm. You'd only have to ask me once as an owner, I would understand exactly what you meant.

You're putting your $3 million check at risk over somebody. You pay $200 an hour's sending their last invoice.[00:58:00] 

They'll either get it and it'll be done in 24 to 48, or use the next strategy and you gotta call me for the next one.

All right? Ways you lose credibility and how to get it back. Um, here's some of the worst ones and the ones that happen most often with first time buyers. So like clipboard, bro. All right. I think, you know, going to Jersey, I got my 25 questions. I'm a in sequential order.

You gotta get off of that. Um, and, and here's why. So if I'm in the seller seat and I'm selling to you, Gil or Steve, or, um, we had somebody else join Polly, although I value that you're dialed in and you're asking a lot of good questions. Um.

I'm also assessing whether I think you have the risk tolerance to [00:59:00] actually personally guarantee $3 million worth of debt. And if each time we talk, you got some long old clipboard, that to me symbolizes not dealing with risk well then, although the questions are relevant, you're well within your right to ask them.

You start giving off the smell of someone that doesn't have sufficient risk appetite for this kind of transaction. So what I recommend is you don't ask not one single question less, just leave the clipboard at home. Ask it in the form of a conversation, ask it on a phone call. Um, send it to the broker to ask on your behalf.

Have your QOE person ask it, have your lawyer ask it people you can call crazy. Leave the clipboards at home. Overanalyzing is the same kind of thing. Um, the reason I think the deal breakers up front listing 'em are so important is [01:00:00] because if you call the broker for a whole week, well, I thought that number one customer was 17% in 2012 months, but in 2025, they're 21%, and that's over my threshold.

And I don't know, and I, I don't know, my mentor, my investor, my equity, although you're well within your right to ask those questions, what you're giving off is, I don't have the risk appetite for this. And then let's just talk about incentives. If I'm the broker and you overanalyze stuff with me or you clipboard, bro, my client, you know what I'm doing right?

I'm calling the person behind you in the auction seeing if they can get their money together before you, I'm not supposed to exclusivity, but we're all growing and we're trying to get paid. So that's the real kinda whip on that. Um, treating your negotiation like a TV show. Uh, we talked about the [01:01:00] brokers being jerks, but I've seen first time clients try to show up like, you know, Johnny Ka in court or something.

And, uh, it's just, there's points in the negotiation. Like when you ask him, Hey, is your, is your, is your lawyer getting any money after this deal's time? Sometimes you have to be that person, but you wanna hit 'em like four or five times and then go back to being a great person. Um, the way you lose credibility, also not holding your ground because only a formidable person shows up with a million dollars in 90 days.

So if you're still figuring out what you're gonna do, that's why you kind of say, I don't know what I'm gonna do yet. Once you, for the second or third time say, I can't do 21% customer concentration and you do it. I can't do anything less than a 15% seller note. You take 12. Come on [01:02:00] bro. Come on sis. You blew your credibility by asserting things that you didn't have to assert, that you didn't stand up behind.

And then how do you get your credibility back? I think it's honesty, emitting fault and correcting bad behavior because there's so much money in these transactions. People want you to be the person. They put a lot of money and time energy into you. They don't want you. They, even if they call your backup, your backup's gonna take 60 days longer than you and they know it.

So even if you screw up stub your toe, the first call is the broker. Once again, we hate 'em sometimes, but they play a role. Hey, I screwed up last week. I said something to the seller that was silly. I shouldn't have said it. They didn't deserve it, and I didn't have enough trust built to say it. Um, I probably lost some credibility last week.

Am I shot or do I have a chance to get it back? That's not indicative of my behavior in the past two months. Haven't been back. So let's, [01:03:00] let's, let's strategize together on how I can buy a business and you can get paid. Does that resonate with folks? You guys kind of get what I'm saying?

**Chris:** It does. I, I just, uh, I feel like it'll be particularly true for me in the next couple weeks, but I've had a few, you know, uh, I've, I've used the phrase, Hey, you know, I'm doing this. Out of good faith in looking for win-wins. If there's anything that looks off to you, just call it out and let's have a talk about it.

Right. And I know that secretly they probably scream when they see like, I'm not, you know, well we, we can save this for, but like working capital, they're like, oh Chris, we are just gonna do this and just put it in the OI like get it. That's not gonna fly with a lender if I just put that there. So, um, I've [01:04:00] had to, you know, not only take that into account and I'm sure like also like sort of play humble in, in many respects, but also in some areas I am generally learning it with them and have to explain it to them.

So I've had to say, gave me a few days to figure this out. 'cause what you're saying sounds directionally right. I'm not sure if it still works, so I need to, you know, so they know. I always like to take a day or a couple hours to think. Uh, but let them know an indication if I feel it's going the right way or not.

So that's sort of our style. So far 

**Elliot:** I've seen this and I've used these statements to set the tone for why I need a couple days or why I can't act with yes. One is I could lie to you today and say that that working capital number will fit, but because I have been studying this for two or three years, I know the lender's not gonna accept it.[01:05:00] 

And so the lie today that'll put a smile on your face now will make you furious at me in 30 days. I'm gonna move along this process every single day with deals and trades and negotiations that I can close on, and that sometimes is going to mean I don't make you happy, but it also means that I'm considering what I can close.

The other one is I just remind people again. Um, if you believe I'm gonna be the guy that's bringing the Brinks truck in three months, you have to believe I'm the kind of person that negotiates for myself. Well, that stands up to opposition. If I'm gonna pay you the seller note, you don't want excuses, then you don't want me allowing customers to push me about account receivable.

So although everybody wants me to roll over and just do whatever you want, you kind of don't when it, when I'm paying you that, you know, half a million dollar seller note and just kind of remind them that even though they may not be getting their way [01:06:00] today, them getting their, where today puts their other piece of money at risk in 30, 60 days.

We talked a little bit about deal heat. If you can't deal with it yourself, get an accountability buddy. Get an advisor to call bs, uh, do a check-in. Um, you know, now there's peer groups, there's, you know, business coaches, um. You can have deal heat. You can't consistently demonstrate it to the seller and the broker

**Athena:** or, so I'm, I'm, I'm interpreting this two different ways. Is this like being on Tilt or is this being in love with the deal and, and 

**Elliot:** love with the deal? 

**Athena:** Yeah. Okay, good. Um, so, you know, one of the things we definitely do is, is play devil's advocate here, and then also the group gets together too. So I think the big [01:07:00] thing on this is like, just, it's so easy to fall in love with the deal and it's really hard to hear when people tell you otherwise.

So it's like if you have it and you're talking to people about it being open. To hearing about, you know, it's like you get into a relationship with somebody and you're like in that like honeymoon period and people are like, uh, I don't know, they've got a criminal record and a bunch of that. Are you sure of this?

You know, and you don't wanna hear it, so That's 

**Elliot:** right. 

**Athena:** Yeah. Okay. I, uh, I'm glad we defined that. 'cause you know, I, I was also reading this as like, if we're using the poker terms, like going on tilt, right? Oh, okay. And then you, you make crazy decisions too. And I, I think the brokers can certainly, you know, Gil's broker went on tilt like a crazy person.

So, um, 

**Elliot:** you know, well, the funny thing is I think one can lead to emotional 

**Athena:** things that can happen. Sorry, go ahead. 

**Elliot:** One can lead to the other. I think being in love with the deal and [01:08:00] running through orange and red flags. Mm. Now your lender is like, Hey, I'm not seeing the DSCR and now, you know, you can't push the lender or ignore 'em.

And now your brain goes

and you're on tilt because you ran through so many stop signs that when you came up against a brick wall, it's like cognitive dissonance. Um, something to consider. 'cause I think sometimes we feel bad about our psychological proclivities to be in deal heat, but think about this, the best investors in the world, the Warren Buffets of the world, still do quality of earnings.

Still have advisors that will tell them no. So even after 30 years of investing, they also know that once they pick a deal, they're gonna be psychologically connected to it in some way. And so even 1% less objective. [01:09:00] And so you're not alone in deal heat, it's just, it's your first time. So it's like that crush you had in high school versus college.

It's just you, you know, you're, you're, you're not positioned well. For making good decisions. And since this one is so big, you wanna make sure that you're considering your psychological connection and, and getting people who you're listening to if they, if they say something stinky, um, and being comfortable, but you may not be the smartest person on every decision, even though you're the ultimate one.

Taking on the risk on the upside. Right? 

**Athena:** Yeah. You're, you know, as a business owner, you have to take counsel, but ultimately you make the decisions, but it's, it's making sure you're getting that counsel right. And I'm, I. There's different voices out there. I know, I know your position on it 'cause you own the company, but we definitely advocate like never do a deal without doing a QV.

Like, yes, it's a big price tag, but my gosh, it's gonna be the best money you've ever [01:10:00] spent when it either saves you from walking into something that wasn't as it appeared and or confirms that what you thought was there was there. And then you've got that like confidence that, okay, I can push all my chips in the table now.

You know, like I've, I've got the, the, you know, I've got my pair of AEs and I've got two ACEs on, on the board. Like, yes, there's nothing stopping me now, you know, nothing stopping me. But, but before those cards are flipped. You don't know, you know, you've got a good hand, but you don't know how good. So I, um, I, I, I and, and having somebody that will push back and tell you like, Hey, I, I know you spent a bunch of money so far.

That's kind of why we coach folks to things in the order that we do. So you're not drafting the a PA before the QV is done, or before you even get term sheets. Right? Right. Get your term sheets, then you can go with the QV and then, and then you can start drafting things and it saves you [01:11:00] from spending a ton of money all at once.

So, um, that was a rant everybody hears. No, 

**Elliot:** no. That 

**Athena:** all before. But I'm, I'm, I'm, uh, I'll give 

**Elliot:** you a for instance. So I'm one of the only QOE providers that, on a section of my testimonials page about a third is people who I saved from financial ruin who were still happy. They paid me Yes. Dead deal fees.

Elliot kept me out of the poor house. I was running towards it. I was lighting money on fire and he stopped me. And I, I, I tell people that because everybody likes the frosty stories of, oh, the QOE confirmed everything I thought, and I did the deal and I'm rich. That's simple. But I've got folks that are like, yeah, I, um, I'd be poor and most of my clients are married with kids.

I would've subjected my wife or husband and children to a fundamentally different and more strained life had [01:12:00] I not spent this money and I wouldn't have seen it. So, um, again, right, there's a lot of people out there, but all these things are meant to kind of give you an indication of who's doing good work on the great deals and on the, the funky ones.

Right.

Let me just stop. Do you guys have any questions? Because I, I feel like I kept going and we have some questions in the interim. The, the rest of the slides, I don't know if we should go through 'em. I'd rather go questions if you guys have any. If not, then I got, I.

**Athena:** I said go through it. This is all great stuff. I'm, I'm en raptured. I don't know about these folks. Uh, Steve and Chris, I just saw you on meeting. Did you have questions while we have Elliot, this is a amazing resource. Yeah, I 

**Chris:** have, but I'm, but I'm also Okay. If you wanna finish your slide and [01:13:00] then 

**Athena:** No, no, no.

Like this is for you guys too. If, if Elliot doesn't mind, I think ask your questions. 

**Chris:** Yeah. I guess selfishly right, I'll, I'll give you some, let me, let me frame my question. I should have thought, but basically, I guess I'm curious about what point QV, right. Normally, how I think of it is diligence on financials, right?

Making sure, like what you're saying, if there's anything on savory, if there's any deal breakers. Can you maybe expand in the context? Right. I'll be looking at a, it's a business that's has historically high levels of inventory. Owners don't really understand. I've explained it, I'm sure we'll have to do it again.

Understand the concept of working capital, uh, in, in its entirety, right? Not they know inventory though. But also if you can maybe as, as you share that, but also what, the part that I'm curious about, how do we handle real estate? I, I have friends in commercial real estate, but in this [01:14:00] case there's three properties.

Um, any, any stories or, or things that I should consider? So, so taking it back, real estate's 

**Elliot:** easier. 

**Chris:** Okay. So real estate, high inventory or historical, um, inventory levels where some of it will definitely be excess inventory. And then dealing with that. And then just in general and just, I, I could use a, you know, just any, any thoughts on.

**Elliot:** Because there's certain things that I know really well. I'm quick to tell you ones that I don't, 'cause I don't want you to ever be confused on the real estate side of things. Go talk to your real estate friend. Not that I don't have a point of view. If I had one I'd share, but like I know all the rest of this stuff in this presentation, like top 10% in the world, real estate, I'm not that good.

So I don't even wanna play around with it. Um, inventory. Here's one somewhat easy way to, um, have the discussion. [01:15:00] When you have excess inventory, you know it, even if you don't wanna admit it. So if you have a widget that you bought this year that's gonna sell in six months, and you have a widget square that you bought 10 years ago that hasn't sold, everyone knows that second widget isn't worth this much, right?

So there's a couple ways to, to do it where people have a difference of opinion. Um, I'll buy X dollars of inventory and the rest I'll pay you on a consignment. So we'll just, if you're betting that it's sellable, I agree with you and I'll pay you out as soon as it sell.

Yeah. If you think you're better at selling it than me, just take it off the books then and, and go sell it without me. 'cause I may take a while. I know. But, but that's, that's one way. And, and, and that [01:16:00] pushback is sort of like a dollar of inventory should be worth a dollar to you and to them at the same time, if you're feeling different about it, pushing it to consignment is one way.

If you like it so much, you keep it and sell it. You still have the customer relationships. I actually for, for that amount, for that inventory, I actually don't mind put it in escrow. You can compete against me and sell it. I don't, I, I, I don't, concern doesn't concern me. Um,

the consignment part works a lot on excess inventory that, um, 

**Chris:** yeah. Sorry, I, I got excited and started to fi Finish your thought. Go ahead. 

**Elliot:** Sorry. No, that, that's, that's really it. I've seen that. It's really hard to push back on it if it ain't excess. Mm-hmm. And I pay you out a consignment. What's the issue?

**Chris:** Yeah. No, thank you. Thank you for sharing that. I, I, on my situation without, you know, just being [01:17:00] mindful that there's possibly other questions, um, it's along those lines. And so I've put consignment in the LOI as a, as my preferred solution, but they, they've actually acknowledged that there's probably more, they run inventory heavy and they thought this will be a gentleman's agreement.

So what they offered is they high level, it's like there's like 4 million bucks of, or four point something of inventory. They're like, we know, um, that's, that's not all usable. They draw 16 month mark. Uh, you know, we, you know, and they say, you know, we run heavy so that's why we're doing 16 months. And then they came up with a number that was roughly 2.4 or two point something million and then they're like, we'll offer you a discount to that 25%, that's 1.8.

And then of that 1.8, you go get an inventory loan for one and we'll finance that 800. So, I mean, I thought they were recent, you know, I could see they're trying to do a win-win. With [01:18:00] that said, I said, we can explore that as well in diligence, but I can't commit, you know, so my oi doesn't have, you know, the 

**Elliot:** inventory better than me.

I can't commit to that 'cause I don't know it well enough yet. That was smart. 

**Chris:** So, so, but, but the reason I selfishly asked this is something I'll have to find a solution over the next 90 days. So I'm giving you a big real life example. Hence, hence the selfish question as to how does that, well, most 

**Elliot:** people say, Hey look, um, what's the average turn on inventory?

Anything that's been around longer than the average turn is excess. So if on average their inventory turns in three months, anything over three months is excess. Right? Um, there's a lot of ways once you kind of get into a quality of earnings, because a lot of what we do is kind of look at excess inventory.

You can have sort of, hey, you know, 98% of the stuff that's been there, less than six months sold in the past six months. So, had you, had, you bought this [01:19:00] six months ago, 98% of the stuff that was under six months old then has sold by now. So you'd be comfortable like buying stuff that's like under six months old, over six months.

You, you shouldn't, and, and you should get compensated for, for it. Um. So that's another way that your, your, the working capital component of a solid quality of earnings will, will help you answer that question numerically, right? You can say it in a call, but you could have two or three spreadsheets that show it as well.

Okay, cool. And then QOE you also kind of talked about starting. Um, to me, I, I agree with Athena that look, get your term sheets, get as much stuff as you can going. The other thing I'll say, and my Harvard friends screw this up the most, don't spend two, three months waiting too long [01:20:00] thinking that you're saving money.

And then you start QOE so late that I'm asking for QuickBooks four months after you started diligence. And then now the seller's like, what the heck can you do for four months? And my Harvard friends blow up their deals all the time thinking they're doing more. Pre-work than they actually can do. So it's just a balance there.

I athena's guidance on that. I would, I would trust hers. I, I think she's got it dialed in on both sides. 

**Athena:** Thanks, Elliot. Um, and, and I, I guess it's like illustrating the importance of doing a QV with somebody that does this backwards and forwards, right? Like the work in progress, the working capital, the inventory, um, you know, looking at any seasonality, potential issues that you might have, turnover or those things that he was saying that, you know, one-off project costs, those sorts of things that we just don't know mm-hmm.

To look for necessarily. And the owners themselves don't know. They just run the business. Right. So That's right. It's, I, I joke, I joke with [01:21:00] lenders 'cause they want buyers to be able to do the sophisticated modeling. I'm like, well, can the current owner do that? You know? And then they're like, oh, oh yeah, yeah.

You know, hold on. So it's like, 

**Elliot:** banker, can you do it? 

**Athena:** Yeah. Right. Show, show me 

**Elliot:** how, without that template that somebody else did for you that you paid off of Upward. Yeah. Um, for QOE, uh, Justin Willis did a podcast on acquiring minds, and if you haven't watched it, I encourage you to watch it. A 'cause Justin's just such a boss for sharing it, but B, he made almost every mistake in the book work in progress, inventory, overpaying, trusting, too much going cheap on QOE.

He didn't say it explicitly, but based on the results going cheap on legal. And I think it's just a [01:22:00] reminder of how any one of these things could be significant enough for you to get in trouble. Please don't do 'em all. Um, I was a self-funded searcher. Nobody likes putting money at risk, but the alternative is so much worse.

Um, and you don't know what to look for. Like Justin got screwed up over a confession of judgment. Everybody's like, what's that? What's that? What's that? I knew that from my private equity days, but you wouldn't know that. You look at the words, read 'em in a English speaking document, not know that. That means as soon as you don't pay me, I can take every asset you own by one strike of the judge's pen before the bank ever gets to claim their, um, primary position before the bank ever gets to grab an asset.

You're, you're bankrupt. And so those things that you don't know when you're betting this big are important. [01:23:00] Round out your great, you know, ambition, your great, um, perseverance. With folks that have been around this long enough to keep you outta trouble.

**Athena:** I couldn't agree more. So you said Justin Willis, was that the name of the cool? Yep. Um, Anka, we can pull that out and post the link to Iron 

**Elliot:** Pony, I think was the construction company. He bought 

**Athena:** Iron Pony. Cool. We'll pull that out and drop it with the replay, along with your contact details. Um, so like I know we're coming up at the time, maybe we have to have you back for part two 'cause that was amazing and super valuable.

I learned a lot as I do every time I have a conversation with you, which is why, you know, it's as a, as a owner, as a buyer, you wanna surround yourself with people. That have more experience with you, that have a different lens, that do these sorts of things. So, um, really appreciate you sharing so much value today.

Keeping it [01:24:00] real. It's why now you can see why Elliot and I were just fast friends. It was like, we're here, we're ourselves, we're gonna speak our minds. And ultimately we want everybody to make decisions that don't bankrupt yourself. Right? Like that you're making good decisions for you overall. Go get rich.

**Elliot:** Don't go get poor. 

**Athena:** Yeah.

So that was incredible, Elliot. Um, we're gonna post your details. Um. Along with the, the replay for everybody here. Um, I would say also, like if you're not already, follow him on LinkedIn. He does a lot of really amazing content like this too. You can never learn enough from good people. So, um, Elliot's one of those legitimate voices out there like Will Smith and acquiring minds, like telling the reality of what's behind the deals.

Um, and hopefully you all consider 'em when it comes time to that, when it comes time for your QV and your diligence too. Because as you can see, you're not just getting somebody that can do the diligence, but you're getting somebody that [01:25:00] can help you at those crucial points that come up, which they will when you go through this.

'cause there is no deal that you get under LOI and it's just smooth sailing. Like, have you seen one Elliot in all of your time? No. That no matter how good the deal does it just sail through to the close. 

**Elliot:** No, you gotta, you gotta run through a couple brick walls to, to carry your good deal. Success. Success.

And then you might have to run through a couple brick walls to throw that crazy deal off of a ledge. Um, another plug for my content. I, I challenge people directly on LinkedIn and I tell folks if they wanna disagree with me, they better bring data 'cause I have it. And so I have a good time. So even if you just want some comic relief or, uh, watching somebody, um, call BS on folks.

Uh, and I'm not a crazy person. I'm, I'm most of the people I still DM after we have a public spat, and, and a lot of them we turn into friends, but I'm not backing down, so, so follow me on LinkedIn and YouTube and you'll, you'll have some fun. 

**Athena:** Yeah, [01:26:00] good. EE entertaining and education all at the same time.

That's, uh, so, so much fun. Hey, I'm curious, I know we're running a little bit over, but, um, so you said 90% of your clients are first time buyers. Um, like first time buyers love the idea of buying a business. How, what, what would you say is a percentage or what do you think is. The likelihood of closing when you're a first time buyer going out.

This idea of ownership, right?

**Elliot:** Um, so if Athena wasn't here, I would say the same thing. And I've said it, um, on wax, and I, I actually think that, so, so let me give you back. So anybody who wakes up today can call themselves a self-funded searcher. There's no qualifications. You ain't gotta raise no money. At least the forest, a live oak doesn't have to like you.

So I think somewhere between 90 and 97% of people who claim to be a self-funded searcher don't [01:27:00] close unassisted. So do, do it yourself people. I think that's the efficacy. And I think you can, you know, maybe it swings up a little bit down a little bit, but, um, I think that's true. And if you look, Heather and Justin posted some great information a couple months back, the past five or six years, there's been about 5,000.

Self-funded SBA seven A deals done each year. And I would argue there's probably about a hundred thousand people searching all those years with the Codys and the Walkers and the Ben Kellys. So the numbers kind of triangulate to the same thing on an assisted basis. So when you have an Athena, when you have an Elliot and you have people who are both guiding you on how to move quicker through deal sourcing and evaluation, but also advising you not to do dumb deals, I think you're between 30 and 70% depending on who you are.

**Anke:** Yeah. So, and a lot of 

**Elliot:** the people who end up leaving, like I, I had to cry myself a river. I had like a, a [01:28:00] mastermind guy who had two Lois in six months, but then I think he realized his risk appetite wasn't sufficient to bet a million bucks on a private company. And I actually think. He's, he's right and he is probably better for him to go put his money in like the s and p or real estate.

And so even that's not like he's not crying in his pillow. He probably saved a lot of money in headache. So some of the folks that don't get it done still find, I think, the best outcome. Um, but I think getting a good advisor helps you substantially 'cause you just don't know this. Like, here's the thing, everybody on this call has probably been working 15, 20 years at something.

So I showed up at your job and tried to kick your butt, do it yourself. I'd be in a lot of trouble, right? At a certain point I should find whoever's best paying a little bit of money, particularly if I was betting a million bucks in whatever you guys do. [01:29:00] 

**Athena:** Yeah, love that. And um, you know, everybody here.

Works really hard, makes great decisions, and takes the steps. So, um, you know, I think that's part of the, the fear of like signing up with a, an advisor too, right? Um, so they, they've all bet on themselves and we love working with 'em. But I was just curious, your take, 'cause there's, it's the gold rush right now.

It's the world's largest poker tournament. And anybody can enter, you know, 

**Elliot:** anyone can enter. Um,

what I like about self-funded is it's like grit. It is a poker tournament. Like if you keep playing poker, you're gonna start getting some money and kicking some butt. If you start reading, watching other people play, if you really dial in versus just, oh, I'm a great poker player. Watch me play with all this pizazz.

No, no, no. If you dial in, get a good advisor, play the game, right. Learn from every decision you can win. And you don't have to be rich to [01:30:00] get rich in this game as a. It was a guy that didn't grow up with a silver spoon in his mouth. Some of the other games that I played, like private equity and even independent sponsor, you almost have to have like a top 25 NBA.

Mm. It's unfair because it's like a lot of people who are smarter than me aren't gonna go through those places, and so they get locked out. This one, you go to the bank down the street, get a government back loan and, and go put up a million dollar bet. Um, like I helped a, a caterer by a auto shop, uh, last year, like a 55-year-old dude, you know, just totally getting after it.

And, and, and those stories, me happy. 

**Athena:** Absolutely. That's what we're here for too. So, um, well that was super enjoyable. Thank you so much, Elliot. I feel super hyped and I hope everybody else does too. It's amazing to know that there's folks like you out there supporting, um, you know, people into ownership and first time buyers specifically.

So we'll drop the replay, we'll drop his, uh, [01:31:00] uh, contact details, follow him on LinkedIn, get in touch with him when it's time for diligence. Um, and I will try to convince him to come back to do more of these too in the meantime. So thank you so much. I'm down. Just 

**Elliot:** ask. Yeah. Thanks for having me guys. Guys.

Amazing. 

**Athena:** So good. Thank you. Good to see you. Thank you so much. Good to see everyone. We'll see you next time. Take care. Bye.
