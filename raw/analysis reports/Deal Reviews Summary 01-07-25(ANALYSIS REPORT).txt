Transcript excerpt: "…remind me what you've already talked through the L.Y."
Issue: “L.Y.” in deal context
Likely intended: “LOI”

Impact: High

Impact: Low

[Error #4 - Category: Omissions/Truncations + Semantic Inconsistency]
Location: 0:27 – AcquiMatch Team
Transcript excerpt: "…glad you were able to. Cover the Joe party, seem cheerful or glad that you."
Issue: Fragmented sentence; “Joe party” unclear
Likely intended: “cover the Joe [property/deal], seemed cheerful…”

Impact: Medium

Impact: Medium

Impact: Medium

[Error #10 - Category: Business Terminology Distortion]
Location: 19:41 – Luke Gillespie
Transcript excerpt: "…squirrel samples have been improving…"
Issue: “squirrel samples” in environmental context

Impact: High

[Error #11 - Category: Financial/Numerical]
Location: 21:51 – AcquiMatch Team
Transcript excerpt: "…I just need those 20 people of financials."
Issue: Nonsensical phrase replaces a year reference

Confidence: High

Impact: Medium

Confidence: Low-Medium
Reasoning: Garbled sentence; proper nouns likely misrendered.
Impact: Medium

[Error #16 - Category: Business Terminology Distortion]
Location: 50:59 – Athena/Team
Transcript excerpt: "…count towards your equity ejection."
Issue: “equity ejection” incorrect term
Likely intended: “equity injection”

Location: 51:51 – Luke Gillespie
Transcript excerpt: "…doing the 25 year emerald for real estate…"
Issue: “emerald” in loan terms
Likely intended: “amort[ization]”

Impact: High

[Error #19 - Category: Omissions/Truncations]
Location: 53:00 – Athena Simpson
Transcript excerpt: "…current rates actually with what the current SBA will"
Issue: Sentence cut off mid-thought
Likely intended: “…current SBA rate [~10%] will be for the business portion…”

Impact: Low

[Error #20 - Category: Entity Name/Semantic]
Location: 53:30 – Luke Gillespie
Transcript excerpt: "That that officer will deal with Jason."
Issue: “officer will deal” likely wrong
Likely intended: “that Office Suites deal with Jason”
Confidence: Medium
Reasoning: Ties back to “Crown Office Suites” mention.
Impact: Low-Medium

Patterns to note for ASR improvement
- Misheard acronyms: LOI → L.Y.; NDA → India; equity injection → equity ejection; amortization → emerald
- Entity names: HubSpot; Acquiring Minds; Anka → Hawkeye; Crown Office Suites; person surname (“Eric Tom nary”) garbled
- Environmental terminology: soil samples → squirrel samples
- Frequent truncations/omissions causing fragmented sentences (multiple locations)
- Consistent “write up/right up” variability; occasionally flips intent (in progress vs completed)

Removals
- None recommended. All small talk is brief, transitional, or tied to client/deal operations, market education, or internal process.

Borderline segments (requires review)
[BORDERLINE #1 - Requires Review]
Location: 3:17–3:38
Content excerpt: "…fantastic job update today… really good explanation… well prepared…"
Business relevance argument: Performance feedback tied to client-facing presentations and assigning industry update tasks.
Personal content argument: Compliment-heavy and could be seen as rapport.
Recommendation: KEEP — establishes accountability and leads directly to process improvements (industry updates, sources).

Speaker attribution validation
- Overall flows logically (Athena directs; Luke/Team report). A few garbled lines (e.g., ~43:00) reduce clarity but do not clearly indicate swapped speakers.

Context preservation notes
- No removals; flow remains intact.
- Where errors are flagged as truncations, reviewers should check audio to restore full meaning (especially around environmental liability, modeling numbers, and platform names).
