[Error #1 - Category: Misheard Term (Acronym/Technical)]
Location: ~00:18:30–00:21:00 / Speaker: Athena
Transcript excerpt: "Then we're getting to the equity ejection amount... a minimum of 5% needs to go towards your equity ejection."
Issue: "equity ejection" appears multiple times in a financing context
Likely intended: "equity injection"
Confidence: High
Reasoning: In SBA and deal structuring, the standard term is equity injection (cash put into the deal). “Ejection” is not a term used in this context. The same concept is referenced repeatedly.
Impact: High - could confuse critical financing requirements

[Error #2 - Category: Misheard Acronym]
Location: ~00:06:30–00:07:10 / Speaker: Athena
Transcript excerpt: "Some of you that are gonna be using a ROB strategy, you'll need to be setting up a C Corp."
Issue: "ROB strategy" in SBA/tax structuring context
Likely intended: "ROBS strategy" (Rollovers as Business Start-ups)
Confidence: High
Reasoning: ROBS is the standard acronym for rolling over retirement funds to finance a business; “ROB” is not used.
Impact: High - affects understanding of entity/tax setup

[Error #3 - Category: Misheard Acronym (COVID relief)]
Location: ~00:10:10–00:10:45 / Speaker: Athena
Transcript excerpt: "Or let's say they got PPE or, uh, not PPE, um, I can't remember the name of the, the program, but the... grants that businesses were getting during COVID..."
Issue: “PPE” is mentioned, then self-corrected as not PPE; intended COVID relief program unclear
Likely intended: "PPP" (Paycheck Protection Program) and/or "EIDL Advance"/"ERC"
Confidence: Medium
Reasoning: In financial adjustments, one-time COVID relief (PPP/EIDL/ERC) is commonly removed from revenue; PPE refers to equipment, not grants/relief.
Impact: Medium - important to classify revenue adjustments correctly

[Error #4 - Category: Misheard Acronym/Truncation]
Location: ~00:26:10–00:26:25 / Speaker: Athena
Transcript excerpt: "You might need to refinance the whole loan at, uh, year five in order to satisfy the. BA because they don't like the seller getting paid back before they do."
Issue: “BA” appears where “SBA” is expected
Likely intended: "SBA"
Confidence: High
Reasoning: Context is SBA seniority on repayment; truncation of the initial “S” is likely ASR error.
Impact: Medium - could mislead about lender policies

[Error #5 - Category: Misheard Acronym]
Location: ~00:28:30–00:29:10 (also repeated ~00:41:00) / Speaker: Athena
Transcript excerpt: "We always leave the deal estimate at about 5% of the purchase price. That'll be your SBA fees, your lawyer fees, um, your QV, that should cover kind of everything..."
Issue: "QV" mentioned in diligence cost context
Likely intended: "QoE" (Quality of Earnings)
Confidence: High
Reasoning: QoE is the standard diligence product in SMB/M&A; "QV" is not a standard term here.
Impact: High - QoE is a key diligence concept

[Error #6 - Category: Semantic/Word Substitution]
Location: ~00:47:05–00:47:30 / Speaker: Athena
Transcript excerpt: "Hey, Mr. Suer, uh, if you put 5%... then I'll pay you like 3.65 million..."
Issue: "Mr. Suer" in seller negotiation context
Likely intended: "Mr. Seller" (or “sir”); “Suer” is unlikely in context
Confidence: Medium
Reasoning: The discussion is about negotiating with the seller; “Suer” is a homophone-like misrendering.
Impact: Low-Medium - clarity of who is being addressed

[Error #7 - Category: Omission/Truncation]
Location: ~00:42:45–00:44:30 / Speaker: Athena
Transcript excerpt: "You could, as the buyer, you could inject as little as like 2.5% and sometimes 0%. So what was happening was cer, like investor investment groups were backing a searcher or an operator..."
Issue: “cer” appears as a fragment before “investor investment groups”
Likely intended: "searcher" (or “some,” but “searcher” fits next clause)
Confidence: Medium
Reasoning: “backing a searcher or an operator” aligns with SMB acquisition financing; “cer” suggests a truncation.
Impact: Medium - improves comprehension of who is being backed

[Error #8 - Category: Semantic Inconsistency/Audio Garble]
Location: ~00:43:00–00:43:25 / Speaker: Athena
Transcript excerpt: "Well, it was, it was on the loan program funded because these, these additional deal costs up there. Also going with the guarantee fees."
Issue: Phrase is syntactically and semantically disjointed
Likely intended: Statement about SBA loan program/guaranty fees and defaults causing changes (content garbled)
Confidence: Medium
Reasoning: The surrounding discussion covers SBA guaranty fees, defaults, and SOP changes; this sentence appears corrupted.
Impact: Medium - muddles explanation of recent SOP rationale

[Error #9 - Category: Misheard Term (Homophone)]
Location: ~00:45:20–00:45:35 / Speaker: Peter
Transcript excerpt: "I never even knew you could use seller financing as part of equity Objection."
Issue: “equity Objection” in place of standard term
Likely intended: "equity injection"
Confidence: High
Reasoning: Consistent with the topic; aligns with earlier “ejection”/“injection” confusion.
Impact: Medium - keeps terminology consistent


[REMOVAL #1 - Type: Small Talk/Personal Travel]
Location: ~00:00:00–00:01:35
Speakers involved: Athena, Peter
Content excerpt:
"Athena: ... quite a few people that are traveling, including myself, so hello from Cape Town.
Peter: Wow...
Athena: Actually, it's not... I'm not in Cape Town anymore... Have you been to South Africa? 
Peter: No, that's on the list... 
Athena: Cape Town is... stunning... scenery... nature..."
Reasoning:
Extended personal travel chat and pleasantries with no connection to business topics.
Context impact: None—business discussion starts immediately after.
Recommended action: REMOVE ~00:00:00–00:01:35

[REMOVAL #2 - Type: Technical/Logistical Interruption]
Location: ~00:21:45–00:23:15
Speakers involved: Athena
Content excerpt:
"So we're buying the real estate for 1 million... 
Well that's a wonderful time for my mouse to die. It just ran outta juice. Okay, we're gonna do it this way. Apologies."
Reasoning:
Technical hiccup and navigation chatter that does not add business content.
Context impact: Low—removal does not affect understanding of the deal-structure explanation.
Recommended action: REMOVE ~00:21:45–00:23:15

[REMOVAL #3 - Type: Meeting Administration]
Location: ~00:31:20–00:31:40
Speakers involved: Athena
Content excerpt:
"I'm gonna pause. I know. Uh, let me see who's still here. Who is here so far? Peter's here."
Reasoning:
Attendance check; not business content.
Context impact: None.
Recommended action: REMOVE ~00:31:20–00:31:40

[REMOVAL #4 - Type: Meeting Administration]
Location: ~00:37:10–00:37:25
Speakers involved: Athena, Luke
Content excerpt:
"Athena: Hey Luke... have we seen any sign from Justin?
Luke: No, Justin has not joined yet."
Reasoning:
Scheduling/status update unrelated to deal content.
Context impact: None.
Recommended action: REMOVE ~00:37:10–00:37:25

[REMOVAL #5 - Type: Technical Aside]
Location: ~00:51:10–00:51:30
Speakers involved: Athena, Peter
Content excerpt:
"Athena: I wasn't sharing my screen that whole time. Oh my goodness.
Peter: That's fine."
Reasoning:
Meta-comment about screen sharing; no business value.
Context impact: None.
Recommended action: REMOVE ~00:51:10–00:51:30


[BORDERLINE #1 - Requires Review]
Location: ~00:38:00–00:39:00
Content excerpt: "Next week we're gonna be bringing on Henry... investor 101... Then the following week we're gonna have Denise... horror story of buying a business..."
Business relevance argument: Program content relevant to buyers seeking education on investor terms and lessons learned—useful context for the community.
Personal content argument: Scheduling and promotional in nature; not directly tied to the modeling walkthrough.
Recommendation: KEEP—still business/educational context for Buyers Club participants.

BORDERLINE/Context notes:
- Brief interjections like "Great. Great.", "Agreed." should be kept for flow; they are minimal and do not warrant removal per guidelines.

Speaker attribution validation:
- No clear speaker misattributions detected; Q&A roles align logically (Athena explains; Peter asks; Luke provides attendance update).

Cross-reference and pattern flags:
- Pattern: ASR consistently mishears "equity injection" as "equity ejection" (and once as “equity Objection”). Suggest targeted ASR tuning for “injection.”
- Pattern: Acronyms frequently misrendered (ROBS→ROB; SBA→BA; QoE→QV). Recommend boosting vocabulary for SBA/M&A terms (ROBS, QoE, PPP/EIDL/ERC, SBA 7(a), 504, DSCR, SDE, EBITDA).

Summary impact:
- High-impact errors primarily involve financing terminology (equity injection, ROBS, QoE) and SBA references; correcting these will materially improve comprehension of deal structure and lender requirements.
- Proposed removals trim non-business chatter and technical interruptions without affecting the educational/business content.
