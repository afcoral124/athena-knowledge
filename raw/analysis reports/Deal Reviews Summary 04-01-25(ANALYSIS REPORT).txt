[Error #1 - Category: Business terminology distortion]
Location: 0:39 / Speaker: Athena Simpson
Transcript excerpt: "…how people could consider this and lowering the SC and having conversations with the brokers."
Issue: "SC" is unclear in this context; likely a misheard word.
Likely intended: "…lowering the ask…"
Confidence: Medium
Reasoning: In deal discussions with brokers, “ask” (asking price) is a common term. “SC” is not standard here and sounds like ASR confusion.
Impact: Medium

[Error #2 - Category: Homophone/Near-homophone]
Location: 1:36 / Speaker: Luke Gillespie
Transcript excerpt: "…the media since nationalizes things so much…"
Issue: Nonsensical phrasing.
Likely intended: "…the media sensationalizes things so much…"
Confidence: High

[Error #3 - Category: Omission/Semantic inconsistency]
Location: 1:42 / Speaker: Athena Simpson
Transcript excerpt: "…drive for three and a half hours to Dallas to get to us and bash."
Issue: Phrase “to get to us and bash” is incoherent.
Likely intended: Possibly “to get to Dallas and back” or a specific event name (e.g., “Austin bash”).
Confidence: Low
Reasoning: The words as transcribed don’t form a meaningful destination/event; likely an ASR drop/misrecognition.
Impact: Low

---
[Error #4 - Category: Speaker Misattribution]
Location: 4:48 / Speakers: Attributed to Luke Gillespie
Transcript excerpt: "ahead, Luke. Okay. So, uh, can I share my screen, please?"
Issue: “Go ahead, Luke” is likely said by another speaker, not Luke referring to himself.
Likely intended: Athena or another team member: “Go ahead, Luke.” Then Luke: “Okay. Can I share my screen…”
Confidence: Medium
Reasoning: Turn-taking logic suggests a prompt then response; current attribution blends them.
Impact: Low

[Error #5 - Category: Business terminology distortion]
Location: 4:48–5:33 / Speaker: Luke Gillespie
Transcript excerpt: "…and he's going to be called for 2.4 million."
Issue: “called” likely misheard.

Impact: Medium

---
[Error #6 - Category: Financial/numerical error]
Location: 5:41 / Speaker: Luke Gillespie
Transcript excerpt: "…So 5% of $1 million, $500,000…"
Issue: The math doesn’t align with the $10M deal context.
Likely intended: “5% of $10 million = $500,000.”
Confidence: High
Reasoning: The deal is repeatedly referred to as $10M; 5% of $1M is $50,000, not $500,000.
Impact: High

---

Location: 6:10 / Speaker: Athena Simpson
Transcript excerpt: "…keep it there because, oh, okay, you're going to his fire profile."

Impact: Medium

---
[Error #8 - Category: Business terminology distortion]
Location: 6:59 / Speaker: Athena Simpson

Impact: High

---
[Error #9 - Category: Semantic inconsistency]
Location: 12:34 / Speaker: Luke Gillespie
Transcript excerpt: "No, equity with a Wendy from SBA prequalification."
Issue: The phrase is not grammatical or meaningful.
Likely intended: “No, check with Wendy on the SBA prequalification” or “Note: check with Wendy…”
Confidence: Medium
Reasoning: They repeatedly discuss checking with Wendy about pre-qual discrepancies; “equity with a Wendy” is likely ASR garble.
Impact: Medium

---
[Error #10 - Category: Word substitution]
Location: 16:36 / Speaker: Athena Simpson
Transcript excerpt: "We can only theorize and pasteurize as much as we can…"
Issue: “pasteurize” is semantically wrong.

Impact: Low

Location: 18:00 / Speaker: Luke Gillespie

Transcript excerpt: "…we'll incorporate it into your search blowing forward."
Issue: “blowing forward” incorrect.

Transcript excerpt: "Got it. Okay, Oscar."

Issue: “slow note” is likely incorrect; also “tuning” appears as a name mishearing.
Likely intended: “seller note” and possibly “Tooti” (person referenced elsewhere).
Confidence: Medium
Reasoning: “Seller note” is on-topic; “slow note” isn’t used in this context. Name “Tooti” recurs in the call.
Impact: Medium

---
[Error #22 - Category: Word substitution]
Location: 1:06:38 / Speaker: AcquiMatch Team
Transcript excerpt: "I'm Tariq."
Issue: Likely preposition misheard, changing meaning.
Likely intended: “On Tariq.” (i.e., “On [the] Tariq [deal]…”)
Confidence: Medium

[Error #24 - Category: Word substitution (sensitive misrecognition)]
Location: ~1:09:30–1:10:10 / Speaker: AcquiMatch Team
Transcript excerpt: "…so that these could be included in the Muslim email."
Issue: “Muslim email” is an offensive misrecognition in this context.
Likely intended: “mass email” or “bulk email.”

Impact: High

[REMOVAL #1 - Type: Off-Topic/Personal + Social Commentary]
Location: 1:42–2:43
Speakers involved: Athena Simpson, Luke Gillespie
Content excerpt:
"Athena: Well, they do have to control people, you know, if people are afraid, then they shut down, they're controllable… I won't get any into any of those discussions because I knew we're running late. So, um, I want to try to wrap up on time because I have to jump in my car and drive for three and a half hours to Dallas to get to us and bash… I've got two phone calls scheduled… I like doing phone calls from the car because it's a good way to pass the time."
Reasoning:
Extended political/social commentary about control/media and personal travel/scheduling details unrelated to deal analysis, financing, or client work.
Context impact: Low – conversation resumes to business planning immediately after.
Recommended action: REMOVE 1:42–2:43

---
[BORDERLINE #1 - Requires Review]
Location: 31:27–34:34
Content excerpt: "…there's very much still this generational gap… I'm 23 with all these old white guys… tips on positioning as a mentee… older men love me because I'm like, tell me your story… they see me as like a daughter…"
Business relevance argument: Provides practical relationship-building tactics for working with older brokers (industry insight and sales strategy).
Personal content argument: Contains personal anecdotes (references to boyfriend, comments about “older men love me,” familial analogies) that verge on non-business.
Recommendation: KEEP—The segment imparts strategic advice on broker relations despite personal tone.

---
[BORDERLINE #2 - Requires Review]
Location: 1:05–1:36
Content excerpt: "…the media just scares people all the time… administration is going to change every four years…"
Business relevance argument: Addresses buyer sentiment and market timing concerns, which impact acquisition decisions.
Personal content argument: Could be seen as general social commentary.
Recommendation: KEEP—Directly tied to client buying behavior and deal timing.

Patterns and Notes for ASR Improvement
- “Pre-qual” consistently misrecognized: “pre fall,” “pre-called.” Recommend boosting language model for “pre-qual/prequalified.”
- “Equity injection” repeatedly misheard as “equity ejection/equity rejection.” High-impact finance term—prioritize correction.
- “LOI” misheard as “UI.” Common acronym confusion—add domain-specific biasing.
- “Seller note” misheard as “slow note.” Domain lexicon update would help.
- “Broker calls” misheard as “worker falls.” Likely phonetic confusion; add broker-specific vocabulary.
- Company name “AcquiMatch” inconsistently transcribed as “Aquamatch/Acquimatch.” Add brand name to custom dictionary.
- Frequent casual acknowledgments misheard (e.g., “awesome” → “Oscar”).
- Sensitive mishearing: “mass email” → “Muslim email.” This is a priority to avoid offensive content.

Segment Mapping Summary (Keep/Remove/Mixed)
- 0:03–0:32: KEEP (brief greetings/praise; team context)
- 0:39–1:36: KEEP (deal/pricing strategy; buyer sentiment)
- 1:42–2:43: REMOVE (political/social commentary + personal travel/schedule)
- 2:43–51:00: KEEP (deal financing, pre-qual discrepancy, investor openness, process)
- 51:00–1:06:33: KEEP (client management: Jason/Tariq deal, service expectations)
- 1:08:07–1:18:20: KEEP (operational follow-ups, off-market outreach, scheduling/action planning)

Speaker Attribution Validation
- Minor misattribution at 4:48 around “Go ahead, Luke.” Flagged in Error #4.

Cross-Reference Consistency
- Pre-qualification amount (2.4M) is consistent but phrasing varies due to ASR errors (pre fall/pre-called).
- Consistent discussion of SBA rules (seller note on full standby 2 years) but “equity injection” term is often misheard—see pattern.
