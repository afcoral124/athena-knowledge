[Error #1 - Category: Misheard Acronym/Entity]
Location: ~00:08:50 / Speaker: Matt
Transcript excerpt: "you’re dealing with mad. and so it’s, uh, I like to think that’s better, but uh, you know, uh, I guess Tom would tell."
Issue: “mad” appears to be a mishearing of the speaker’s name “Matt”; “Tom would tell” likely a mishearing of the idiom “time will tell.”
Likely intended: “you’re dealing with Matt… I like to think that’s better… time will tell.”
Confidence: High
Reasoning: Context suggests he is referring to himself; “time will tell” is the common idiom in this context.
Impact: Medium – introduces confusion about who is being referenced and the idiom used.

[Error #2 - Category: Misheard Acronym]
Location: ~00:20:35 / Speaker: Matt
Transcript excerpt: "there have been a lot of new SBAS bics that have come on"
Issue: “SBAS bics” is not a standard term.
Likely intended: “SBICs”
Confidence: High
Reasoning: Discussion is about Small Business Investment Companies (SBICs). The plural is often spoken as “SBICs.”
Impact: Medium – may confuse listeners about the program being referenced.

---
[Error #3 - Category: Misheard Acronym]
Location: ~00:21:05 / Speaker: Athena
Transcript excerpt: "So, is the SB say, I, I think you, you said this, but the SBA is, is supporting this kind of activity..."
Issue: “SB say” is a mishearing of “SBA.”
Likely intended: “So, is the SBA…”
Confidence: High
Reasoning: The sentence immediately continues with “the SBA,” confirming the intended acronym.
Impact: Low – momentary confusion; quickly clarified in the next phrase.

---
[Error #4 - Category: Misheard Acronym/Term]
Location: ~00:25:40 / Speaker: Matt
Transcript excerpt: "we might have a, you know, call it an eight cash pay interest rate in a 2% pick, payable and kind."
Issue: “pick, payable and kind” misrenders the term for payment-in-kind interest.
Likely intended: “PIK, payable in kind.”
Confidence: High
Reasoning: In private credit, PIK (payment-in-kind) is the standard term; “pick” and “and kind” indicate ASR phonetic/word substitution.
Impact: High – technical financing term; correct interpretation is important.

---
[Error #5 - Category: Financial/Numerical Rendering]
Location: ~00:12:15 / Speaker: Matt
Transcript excerpt: "we’re kind of one and a quarter. Okay. One, three times kind of folks."
Issue: “One, three times” is a likely ASR rendering of “1.3x.”
Likely intended: “1.25x–1.3x DSCR”
Confidence: Medium
Reasoning: In covenants, DSCR is expressed as a ratio (e.g., 1.25x/1.3x). The comma suggests decimal loss.
Impact: Medium – readers may misinterpret target DSCR.

---
[Error #6 - Category: Misheard Acronym]
Location: ~00:20:55 / Speaker: Matt
Transcript excerpt: "you can find SBIs where you are."
Issue: “SBIs” is not the standard acronym in this context.
Likely intended: “SBICs”
Confidence: High
Reasoning: He is directing listeners to find SBICs; “SBIs” appears to drop the “C.”
Impact: Low – still understandable but imprecise.

---
[Error #7 - Category: Misheard Acronym]
Location: ~00:56:45 / Speaker: Matt
Transcript excerpt: "There are a lot of SBS out there. Again, there’s a list out there."
Issue: “SBS” is not the correct acronym here.
Likely intended: “SBICs”
Confidence: High
Reasoning: He is referring to SBIC fund managers and public lists of them.
Impact: Low – minor but recurring pattern.

---
[Error #8 - Category: Homophone/Near-Homophone]
Location: ~00:36:00 / Speaker: Athena
Transcript excerpt: "switching tax a little bit, most of the folks who are first time buyers..."
Issue: “tax” likely intended as “tack” (as in “change tack”).
Likely intended: “switching tack a little bit”
Confidence: High
Reasoning: Common idiom in conversation; “tax” is contextually odd.
Impact: Low – doesn’t materially affect meaning.

---
[Error #9 - Category: Business Terminology Distortion]
Location: ~00:51:50 / Speaker: Athena
Transcript excerpt: "it doesn’t qualify for SBA ’cause it’s a office releaser. Am I saying that right Justin?"
Issue: “office releaser” is not standard terminology for this business model.
Likely intended: “coworking operator” or “office space sublessor”
Confidence: Medium
Reasoning: The subsequent explanation clarifies it’s a coworking model similar to WeWork.
Impact: Medium – could mislead about the business type at first mention.

---
[Error #10 - Category: Entity Name (Company Name)]
Location: ~01:04:40 / Speaker: Andrew
Transcript excerpt: "Anytime I hear Stone Angel, I can think of, is this a spinal tap?"
Issue: “Stone Angel” appears to be a mishearing of “Stonehenge” (both the firm’s name and the Spinal Tap reference).
Likely intended: “Stonehenge”
Confidence: High
Reasoning: The firm is “Stonehenge,” and Spinal Tap has a famous “Stonehenge” gag.
Impact: Low – humorous aside, but wrong company name.

---
[Error #11 - Category: Business Terminology Distortion]
Location: ~01:10:40 / Speaker: Matt
Transcript excerpt: "we’re re uh, since it’s an add-on, we’re restructuring, uh, our, uh, CEO’s, uh, earn a, I mean he had, a big seller note..."
Issue: “earn a” appears to be a truncated/misheard “earnout.”
Likely intended: “earnout”
Confidence: High
Reasoning: In add-on acquisitions, restructuring earnouts and seller notes is common; “earn a” suggests ASR truncation.
Impact: Medium – technical term relevant to deal structure.

---
[Error #12 - Category: Omission/Truncation]
Location: ~00:44:55 / Speaker: Matt
Transcript excerpt: "I. Business here in Dallas. We supported, uh, a sponsor buying this business. There was fraud."
Issue: Initial “I.” suggests a truncated or dropped word/phrase.
Likely intended: “I have a business here in Dallas” or “In a business here in Dallas…”
Confidence: Low
Reasoning: The period after “I” is atypical and reads as an orphaned pronoun.
Impact: Low – overall meaning remains clear.

---
[Error #13 - Category: Semantic Inconsistency]
Location: ~00:04:50 vs ~01:20:30 / Speaker: Matt
Transcript excerpt: 
  Early: "we’ve been investing money in Oklahoma, Mississippi, Georgia, Utah, Nevada."
  Later: "Utah and Nevada… Oklahoma… Missouri… Ohio, Connecticut, Mississippi, Pennsylvania."
Issue: Georgia is listed in the early “state-specific funds” but not included in the later list of eight active states.
Likely intended: Georgia may be a prior or inactive program; later list reflects current active states.
Confidence: Medium
Reasoning: The later list was explicitly “active today.” Early statement didn’t specify current status. Could be accurate but appears inconsistent without clarification.
Impact: Low – may cause confusion about whether Georgia is currently active.

[REMOVAL #1 - Type: Small Talk/Personal Roll Call]
Location: ~00:00:05–00:00:30
Speakers involved: Athena
Content excerpt:
"Hey Gil. Hey to see you. I think Polly might be here too. Yeah. Polly over in Atlanta. Gil is out of New York. Might have a few more trickle in as we go through this, but welcome..."
Reasoning:
Attendee name/location shout-outs and roll call have no bearing on the financing content.
Context impact: None – removal does not affect understanding of the session’s purpose or flow.
Recommended action: REMOVE ~00:00:05–00:00:30

---
[REMOVAL #2 - Type: Personal/Off-Topic Humor]
Location: ~01:04:35–01:05:05
Speakers involved: Andrew
Content excerpt:
"…anytime I hear Stone Angel, I can think of, is this a spinal tap? I’m sure you hear that every… oh yeah, for sure. Yeah."
Reasoning:
Pop-culture joke unrelated to dealmaking or financing; includes a misnaming of the firm.
Context impact: Low – removing these lines leaves the substantive question about approval processes intact.
Recommended action: REMOVE ~01:04:35–01:05:05

---
[BORDERLINE #1 - Requires Review]
Location: ~00:01:50–00:02:20
Content excerpt: "you should have seen how excited I am when we launched our new financial modeling template. I’m like, is this not the coolest thing you’ve ever seen? People are like,"
Business relevance argument: Light rapport-building tied to financial modeling; signals the speaker’s enthusiasm and tool adoption relevant to buyers.
Personal content argument: Informal excitement that does not add technical content; the sentence ends mid-thought.
Recommendation: KEEP – Brief and thematically connected to business analysis; maintains conversational tone.

---
[BORDERLINE #2 - Requires Review]
Location: ~01:04:10–01:04:30
Content excerpt: "it helps that you’re southern too, for the record. I can, I just inherently trust you maybe a little bit more."
Business relevance argument: Establishes rapport prior to asking a process question; could be seen as relationship-building.
Personal content argument: Purely personal/geographic remark; not relevant to financing or process.
Recommendation: REMOVE – Minor and personal; excising does not affect understanding of the following approval-process discussion.

Patterns/Notes for ASR Improvement

- Recurrent mishearing of “SBIC(s)” as “SBAS bics,” “SBIs,” or “SBS.”
- Financing idioms and acronyms: “PIK (payment-in-kind)” rendered as “pick, payable and kind.”
- Names/words clipped or substituted: “mad” for “Matt,” “Tom would tell” for “time will tell,” “maquila door” for “maquiladora,” “earn a” for “earnout.”
- Homophone confusions: “tack” vs “tax,” numeric ratios rendered without decimals (“one, three times”).

Speaker Attribution

- No clear speaker swaps detected; responses align with roles (Athena hosts/moderates, Matt explains structures, Justin/Andrew ask questions). The “I. Business here in Dallas” appears to be a truncation rather than a misattribution.
