High-Priority Removal
[REMOVAL #1 - Type: Off-Topic Politics]
Location: 31:00–33:19
Speakers involved: Athena Simpson (Unrestricted), David R, AcquiMatch Team
Content excerpt:
"Athena: There's a lot of riveting stuff happening right now... Did you watch the congressional address?
David R: ...I watched it...
Athena: ...he has people from the press just in his office at all times... Democrats just sat their sour face the whole time didn't even like clap..."
Reasoning:
Extended political discussion that does not directly inform an active deal, financing, valuation, or client strategy. It does not add business value and veers into opinions about parties and political figures.
Context impact: Low – The conversation cleanly returns at 33:19 to client advisory implications (which should be kept).
Recommended action: REMOVE 31:00–33:19

Borderline Segments (Requires Review)
[BORDERLINE #1 - Requires Review]
Location: 1:13:25–1:13:41
Content excerpt: 
"Athena: Yeah, Luke, you're off tomorrow, aren't you?
Luke: Yes, ma'am... the team all knows that and you all have coordinated..."
Business relevance argument: Internal resourcing/scheduling can be relevant to capacity/throughput of deal processing.
Personal content argument: Pure scheduling note; could be trimmed without impacting understanding of deals.
Recommendation: KEEP (Low removal priority; minor and informs internal coordination)

Impact: Low

Speaker Attribution/Consistency Flags (pattern-level)
- 13:42 appears misattributed: Line labeled as David R but reads like an interjection to David (“sorry, David, keep going”). Suggest reviewing speaker labels around 13:35–13:57.
- Client code/name consistency issues: DL/D.O./deal; Gil/Gail; JSN/JSM/Jason; AA/AH. Recommend a consistency pass so readers can map references to the correct client.

Context Preservation Notes
- Removing 31:00–33:19 will not break flow; the conversation resumes at 33:19 with business-relevant guidance on advising clients across political perspectives and addressing their acquisition concerns.
- The rest of the transcript contains substantive deal strategy, financing options (seller financing, sale-leaseback), diligence (QoE), market/legislative surveillance (tariffs, SBA lending changes), and client success management—all should be kept for business value.

Patterns for ASR Improvement
- Acronyms: CIM consistently transcribed as “sim”; QoE as “Q and V/QAV”; consider custom vocabulary.
- Industry terms: Seller financing as “solar financing”; impostor syndrome as “roster syndrome.”
- Proper nouns/brands: Acquiring Minds; Cold Stone Creamery; HubSpot; Acquira; internal names (Eda/Anca).
- Homophones: “You two”→“YouTube”; “sheet”→“sheep”; “deal flow”→“airflow.”
- Client codes drift: DL/D.O./deal; JSN/JSM; AA/AH. Recommend enforcing a glossary and enabling entity-based biasing in ASR.
