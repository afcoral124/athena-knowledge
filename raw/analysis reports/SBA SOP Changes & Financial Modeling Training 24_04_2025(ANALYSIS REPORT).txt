Detected transcription errors

[Error #1 - Category: Business terminology distortion]
Location: ~00:02:00 / Speaker: Athena
Transcript excerpt: "...what, you know, equity I objection, needed to be and that sort of thing."
Issue: “equity I objection” in SBA financing context
Likely intended: “equity injection”
Confidence: High
Reasoning: “Equity injection” is the standard SBA term; phrase as transcribed is nonsensical in context.
Impact: High – Key to understanding SBA requirements

[Error #2 - Category: Homophone/near-substitution]
Location: ~00:01:35 / Speaker: Athena
Transcript excerpt: "...the SBA guarantee fee plot that everybody pays, pays for, you know, the lender..."
Issue: “plot” conflicts with prior “pot” reference
Likely intended: “pot”
Confidence: High
Reasoning: Earlier sentence correctly described fees going “into a pot.” “Plot” is an ASR slip.
Impact: Low – Minor clarity issue

[Error #3 - Category: Omission/Truncation]
Location: ~00:07:00 / Speaker: Athena
Transcript excerpt: “...seller must personally guarantee the SBA loan for two years post-closing and be listed as a co. Hey, doing Jason. Oh, Anka. Can we,”
Issue: The phrase ends abruptly at “co.”, then crosstalk interrupts
Likely intended: “co-borrower” (or “co-signer”)
Confidence: Medium
Reasoning: Context is lender requirements when seller retains equity; “co-borrower” fits common SBA phrasing used elsewhere in the call.
Impact: Medium – Leaves requirement incomplete

[Error #4 - Category: Financial/Numerical inconsistency]
Location: ~00:12:40 / Speaker: Athena
Transcript excerpt: “...they’re gonna do what’s called a look back... Sometimes it’s six months, sometimes it’s six two years. So I’ll clarify...”
Issue: “six two years” is malformed
Likely intended: “six to twelve months” or “six to two years (up to two years)”
Confidence: Medium
Reasoning: She immediately notes uncertainty; ASR likely dropped “to” or “twelve.”
Impact: Medium – Affects understanding of look-back window

[Error #5 - Category: Semantic inconsistency]
Location: ~00:11:55 / Speaker: Athena
Transcript excerpt: “No. Steve, I see I have a question.”
Issue: The phrase reads as Athena asserting she has a question
Likely intended: “Steve, I see you have a question.”
Confidence: High
Reasoning: Fits the flow (she then yields to Steve’s question).
Impact: Low – Minor, but confusing attribution

[Error #6 - Category: Business terminology distortion]
Location: ~00:27:45 / Speaker: Athena
Transcript excerpt: “...which is how they’re arriving at their overall STE.”
Issue: “STE” in valuation context
Likely intended: “SDE” (Seller’s Discretionary Earnings)
Confidence: High
Reasoning: She is calculating add-backs toward SDE; “STE” is a common ASR swap.
Impact: Medium – Important financial metric label

[Error #7 - Category: Misheard acronym/term]
Location: ~00:47:40 / Speaker: Athena
Transcript excerpt: “This SDI can’t remember. It’s 4 6 6 something...”
Issue: “SDI” used where SDE is being discussed
Likely intended: “SDE”
Confidence: High
Reasoning: Consistent with prior references to SDE and multiples.
Impact: Low – Minor label slip, but could confuse readers

[Error #8 - Category: Business terminology + numerical expression]
Location: ~00:19:00 / Speaker: Athena
Transcript excerpt: “...you could potentially split the equity injection with an investor and you know, even if you were doing a two x step up. Or even a three at 5% equity, they would only be getting 15% ownership...”
Issue: “three at 5%” likely intended to be “3x step-up”
Likely intended: “...2x step-up... or even a 3x step-up...”
Confidence: Medium
Reasoning: Math described (5% cash with 3x step-up = 15% equity) supports “x” multiplier terminology; “at” is an ASR substitution.
Impact: Medium – Clarifies investor equity math

[Error #9 - Category: Omission/Truncation]
Location: ~00:10:25 / Speaker: Athena
Transcript excerpt: “...or if there’s ways to make sure that there’s a license folder in the business that’s not the seller, so that they don’t have to pg.”
Issue: Lowercased/verbified “pg” without expansion
Likely intended: “PG” = “personally guarantee”
Confidence: Medium
Reasoning: Consistent usage throughout; here it reads as an incomplete acronym.
Impact: Low – Domain readers will infer, but expansion improves clarity

[Error #10 - Category: Semantic/label inconsistency (not content)]
Location: ~00:25:35 / Speaker: Athena
Transcript excerpt: “This looks like this is just a TTM January to April.”
Issue: TTM (trailing twelve months) cannot be “January to April”; she later corrects as YTD
Likely intended: “This looks like it’s just YTD (Jan–Apr), not TTM.”
Confidence: Medium
Reasoning: She explicitly distinguishes YTD vs TTM shortly after.
Impact: Low – Self-corrected; minor labeling confusion

Removals

[REMOVAL #1 - Type: Off-Topic/Small Talk]
Location: ~00:07:40–00:08:05
Speakers involved: Athena, Steve
Content excerpt:
“Athena: ...the seller must personally guarantee the SBA loan for two years post-closing and be listed as a co. Hey, doing Jason. Oh, Anka. Can we,
Steve: uh, can I get a number one deluxe with no pickle?
Athena: Got it. Okay, thanks. Um, somebody’s hungry.”
Reasoning:
Fast-food aside and banter are unrelated to business content and interrupt an important point about seller guarantees.
Context impact: Low – Remove only the off-topic lines; the surrounding business point stands.
Recommended action: REMOVE the interjection lines starting from “Hey, doing Jason...” through “somebody’s hungry.”

[REMOVAL #2 - Type: Off-Topic/Technical Housekeeping]
Location: 00:24:00–00:25:10
Speakers involved: Athena, Unidentified participant
Content excerpt:
“Athena: I’m gonna actually pull this out separately so I don’t accidentally click into random things... Okie dokey, right?
Application windows. That’s what I need, isn’t it? Okay, so let me, no, where is that?
...Share. Okay, share. Now let me check with y’all. Can you see me clicking in between the financial modeling in the sim or did I just grab the. Tab, like when I switch?
Participant: No, you’re good, Athena. We can see the switch.”
Reasoning:
Screen-share setup and visual confirmation are administrative/technical and add no substantive value to the financial modeling instruction.
Context impact: None – Removing this does not affect the modeling walkthrough.
Recommended action: REMOVE 00:24:00–00:25:10

Borderline segments (Requires Review)

[BORDERLINE #1 - Requires Review]
Location: 00:53:00–00:55:00
Content excerpt:
Scheduling/announcements about upcoming SBA broker AMA, Live Oak lender AMA, future guest speakers, and closing remarks.
Business relevance argument: Previews expert sessions directly related to SBA lending interpretations and deal execution; useful for participants’ acquisition process.
Personal content argument: Administrative program logistics and general closing pleasantries; not technical content.
Recommendation: KEEP – While administrative, it guides participants to resources critical to current SBA SOP changes.

Patterns and notes for ASR system improvement

- “SDE” frequently misrecognized as “STE”/“SDI”
- “Equity injection” misrecognized as “equity I objection”
- Truncation around compound words with “co-” (e.g., “co-borrower”) when interrupted
- Occasional homophone swaps (“pot”→“plot”)
- Numerical ranges (“six to [x]”) prone to dropping the “to” or the second number

Speaker attribution validation

- One instance of likely misphrased turn-taking (“No. Steve, I see I have a question.”) suggesting ASR confusion; content flow indicates Athena recognized Steve’s question. No other systematic attribution reversals detected.

Context preservation check

- Proposed removals are limited to clear off-topic/technical chatter and will not create gaps in the business discussion. The first removal trims a humorous aside embedded between two related sentences; retain the preceding and following business lines for continuity. The second removal precedes the modeling content and excludes only tech-setup chatter.

Confidence summary

- High confidence for clear terminology/acronym mishears (equity injection, SDE, pot)
- Medium confidence for the look-back range (“six two years”) and “co-” truncation due to interruption
- Low-to-medium for minor label slips self-corrected in context (TTM vs YTD)
