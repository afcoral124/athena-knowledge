TRANSCRIPTION ERROR REPORTS

Location: Line 16 / Speaker: Luke Gillespie
Transcript excerpt: "...he's looking at a 3.5x and he's disappointed in that. I don't think I've ever even seen an H back at less than a 4x..."
Issue: “H back” in a context clearly referring to the HVAC industry
Likely intended: “HVAC”
Confidence: High
Reasoning: Industry shorthand; HVAC is standard. “H back” is a common ASR slip.
Impact: High - industry reference clarity

[Error #2 - Category: Misheard Acronym]
Location: Line 31 / Speaker: Luke Gillespie
Transcript excerpt: "...include real estate that could qualify for the the 504 low or 25 year amort..."
Issue: “504 low” appears where a loan product is referenced
Likely intended: “SBA 504 loan”
Confidence: High
Reasoning: The SBA 504 loan is a standard acquisition/real estate product; “low” is a phonetic error.
Impact: High - financing details clarity

[Error #3 - Category: Truncation/Omission]
Location: Line 31 / Speaker: Luke Gillespie
Transcript excerpt: "...25 year amort..."
Issue: “amort” is truncated
Likely intended: “25-year amortization”
Confidence: High
Reasoning: Standard financing terminology was clipped.
Impact: Medium

[Error #4 - Category: Financial/Numerical Ambiguity]
Location: Line 31 / Speaker: Luke Gillespie
Transcript excerpt: “They have 10 locations... Like a million dollars even done but only listed at $3.2 million asking price.”
Issue: “a million dollars even done” is unclear; likely missing SDE/EBITDA
Likely intended: “~$1.0M SDE (or EBITDA)”
Confidence: Medium
Reasoning: Deal comparisons typically cite SDE/EBITDA; “even done” likely misheard.
Impact: High - valuation/multiple interpretation

[Error #5 - Category: Inconsistent Initials/Entity Reference]
Location: Line 33 / Speaker: Luke Gillespie
Transcript excerpt: “For the BL, one thing that I noticed...”
Issue: Client initials “BL” inconsistent with earlier “DL”
Likely intended: “DL”
Confidence: Medium

Impact: Medium

[Error #6 - Category: Omission/Homophone]
Location: Line 35 / Speaker: Luke Gillespie
Transcript excerpt: “To be honest, I still a lot of RFIs, and we just haven't gotten that many cents for them...”
Issue: Missing verb and “cents” homophone
Likely intended: “I still sent a lot of RFIs, and we just haven’t gotten that many since” (or “responses”)

Reasoning: Grammar and context indicate sending requests and awaiting responses.
Impact: Medium

[Error #7 - Category: Truncation/Omission]
Location: Line 36 / Speaker: Athena Simpson
Transcript excerpt: “And they said they were in the auto body on their.”
Issue: Sentence is incomplete

Impact: Medium

[Error #9 - Category: Homophone/Semantic]
Location: Line 43 / Speaker: Athena Simpson
Transcript excerpt: “And they're looking at service sitting on their hands.”
Issue: “service” appears wrong in context
Likely intended: “instead of sitting on their hands”
Confidence: Medium
Reasoning: Discussion is about waiting vs acting; phrase idiomatically fits as “instead of.”
Impact: Low-Medium

[Error #10 - Category: Semantic Inconsistency]
Location: Line 44 / Speaker: AcquiMatch Team
Transcript excerpt: “I think I can make it crazy in a way that would be okay... If you get an accident with a car, you need to. placed.”
Issue: Several phrases are incoherent (“make it crazy”; “you need to. placed.”)
Likely intended: “phrase/frame it,” “replaced,” etc.
Confidence: Medium
Reasoning: Context suggests framing the pitch; body shop work is replacement-focused.
Impact: Medium

[Error #11 - Category: Homophone (Name)]
Location: Line 46 / Speaker: AcquiMatch Team
Transcript excerpt: “And then look, you can still make the video...”
Issue: “look” is likely the name “Luke”

Transcript excerpt: “...the potholes that just end up being like rainbows...”
Issue: “potholes” likely misheard in pet grooming context
Likely intended: “poodles”
Confidence: High
Reasoning: Pet grooming examples commonly reference “poodles” dyed/styled; “potholes” is nonsensical here.
Impact: Medium

[Error #15 - Category: Omission/Misheard Name]
Location: Line 66 / Speaker: Luke Gillespie
Transcript excerpt: “Yeah. Yeah. Right. I are planning on talking tomorrow...”
Issue: “Right. I are” is ungrammatical; missing “Ryan and I”
Likely intended: “Ryan and I are planning...”
Confidence: High
Reasoning: Frequent collaboration references to Ryan.
Impact: Low

[Error #16 - Category: Omission/Truncation]
Location: Line 70 / Speaker: AcquiMatch Team
Transcript excerpt: “I'm looking promising now to and we're small and the third one is just a few times not picking up.”
Issue: Multiple omissions render it incoherent
Likely intended: Status update about 3 leads; one promising, one small, third not picking up

Impact: Medium

[Error #17 - Category: Homophone/Word Error]
Location: Line 79 / Speaker: Luke Gillespie
Transcript excerpt: “...maybe don't person Wikipedia though. It says my hometown is the 63 third largest...”

Reasoning: Common expression; ordinal formatting error.
Impact: Low

[Error #18 - Category: Truncation/Omission]
Location: Line 80 / Speaker: Athena Simpson
Transcript excerpt: “I mean, . Like, could we run an event...”
Issue: Missing words after “I mean,”
Likely intended: N/A (filler) then event strategy

Impact: Low

[Error #19 - Category: Misheard Acronym]
Location: Line 87 / Speaker: Luke Gillespie
Transcript excerpt: “...and then sometimes it says to be determined and Ryan's close with the Andrew... He says that basically means no when it says TV.”
Issue: “TV” likely “TBD”
Likely intended: “TBD”
Confidence: High
Reasoning: Common listing status; “TV” not used in this context.
Impact: Medium

[Error #20 - Category: Word Choice/Omission]
Location: Line 92 / Speaker: AcquiMatch Team
Transcript excerpt: “Okay, sounds like a little wrong.”
Issue: “a little wrong” doesn’t fit context of last call timing
Likely intended: “a little long” (or “a little while”)
Confidence: Medium
Reasoning: The question was timing (“when’s the last time”).
Impact: Low

[Error #21 - Category: Truncation/Omission]
Location: Lines 95-97 / Speaker: Athena Simpson
Transcript excerpt: “We're like, yeah, but I don't think we're doing. If we could say that there was no fault in our sourcing. Then we could say that.” and “don't think we're. Experts and literally like...”
Issue: Multiple incomplete sentences
Likely intended: Full points about sourcing capacity and expertise
Confidence: Medium
Reasoning: Rapid speech clipped by ASR.
Impact: Medium

[Error #22 - Category: Word Choice]
Location: Line 103 / Speaker: Athena Simpson
Transcript excerpt: “What does he keep doing I.O.I.s?”
Issue: “What does he” likely “Why does he”
Likely intended: “Why does he keep doing IOIs?”
Confidence: Medium
Reasoning: The next lines argue against IOIs; “why” fits query intent.
Impact: Low

[Error #23 - Category: Homophone]
Location: Line 109 / Speaker: Athena Simpson
Transcript excerpt: “...he should have submitted an IOI to show you a series.”
Issue: “series” used where seriousness is intended
Likely intended: “serious”
Confidence: High
Reasoning: Conventional phrase is “to show you he’s serious.”
Impact: Low

[Error #24 - Category: Semantic Inconsistency]
Location: Line 111 / Speaker: Athena Simpson
Transcript excerpt: “...Next time he wants to make an IOI, I'd be like, so let's do an IOI.”
Issue: Inconsistent with prior directive to avoid IOIs and push LOIs
Likely intended: “...so let’s do an LOI.”
Confidence: High
Reasoning: Context two lines earlier: “Stop submitting IOIs.”
Impact: High - changes instruction

[Error #25 - Category: Misheard Acronyms/Terms]
Location: Line 131 / Speaker: AcquiMatch Team
Transcript excerpt: “...asset value would be determined by the during the QF. ... during a Q and D... that’s endemic vacation...”
Issue: Multiple misheard legal/financial terms (QF, Q and D, endemic vacation)
Likely intended: “QoE (Quality of Earnings)” and/or “DD (due diligence)”, and “indemnification”
Confidence: High
Reasoning: Standard deal terms; these are common ASR confusions.
Impact: High - legal/financial accuracy

[Error #26 - Category: Entity Name (Company)]
Location: Line 131 / Speaker: AcquiMatch Team
Transcript excerpt: “...owner's name, which is called Ghettoitz Landscaping...”
Issue: Company name likely misspelled/misheard
Likely intended: A different spelling (e.g., Getowitz/Getoetz, unknown)

Location: Line 131 / Speaker: AcquiMatch Team
Transcript excerpt: “...he can only use the owner's name... for six months... they put in there... only use the name in the third six months.”
Issue: “third six months” likely “first six months”

Confidence: Medium
Reasoning: Brand transition windows typically reference “first X months.”
Impact: Medium

[Error #28 - Category: Misheard Terms]
Location: Line 132 / Speaker: Athena Simpson
Transcript excerpt: “...QV... command and letter... he's using a wire... commit the letters.”
Issue: Multiple misheard terms
Likely intended: “QoE” (or “Q of E”), “commitment letter,” “lawyer,” “commitment letters”
Confidence: High
Reasoning: Standard M&A vocab; all are plausible ASR mistakes.
Impact: High

[Error #29 - Category: Perspective/Semantic]
Location: Line 18 / Speaker: AcquiMatch Team
Transcript excerpt: “...we accepted another offer because he was dragging it out.”
Issue: “we accepted” seems inconsistent perspective if referring to seller’s action
Likely intended: “they accepted another offer”
Confidence: Medium

Impact: Medium

[Error #30 - Category: Misheard Acronym]
Location: Line 18 / Speaker: AcquiMatch Team
Transcript excerpt: “...don't take too long because we saw having to even Eli”
Issue: “Eli” in deal context likely meant LOI
Likely intended: “LOI”
Confidence: High
Reasoning: Consistent with the discussion of offers/letters.
Impact: High

[Error #31 - Category: Word Error]
Location: Line 31 / Speaker: Luke Gillespie
Transcript excerpt: “...It just came into the end box today...”

Impact: Low

[Error #32 - Category: Entity Names]
Location: Line 21 / Speaker: Athena Simpson
Transcript excerpt: “...Austin's searcher of it... He shares... mean shares... Dave Collinson... Dave Collins...”
Issue: Multiple possibly misheard names/venues
Likely intended: Event name/venue, person “Dave Collins” (unclear)
Confidence: Low
Reasoning: Several phonetic distortions; later reference shifts from Collinson to Collins.
Impact: Medium (entity clarity)

REMOVAL RECOMMENDATIONS (Personal/Off-Topic)

[REMOVAL #1 - Type: Personal/Off-Topic]
Location: Lines 27-29
Speakers involved: Athena Simpson, AcquiMatch Team
Content excerpt:
“Athena: All right, get myself ramped up. I'm wearing red and leopard print to get all my power patterns and color ready to go.
AcquiMatch Team: ...story about how you wore the red dress... I told that story to my girlfriend...
Athena: ...my recent post had the picture of me... wearing the exact same dress...”
Reasoning:
Extended clothing/dress anecdote and social sharing unrelated to dealmaking, clients, or strategy.
Context impact: None—business resumes on line 30 with meeting flow.
Recommended action: REMOVE lines 27-29

[REMOVAL #2 - Type: Personal/Off-Topic]
Location: Lines 117-121
Speakers involved: Athena Simpson, AcquiMatch Team
Content excerpt:
“Athena: ...fun fact, my grandfather owned a glass repair... my cousin swears he was like mob adjacent.
AcquiMatch Team: So like the mob would go and bust in... classic mob story.
Athena: My mom... hates it... 
AcquiMatch Team: I just thought he was making it up.
Athena: I'm like, yeah, but glass repair in my family.”
Reasoning:
Personal family/mob anecdote unconnected to current deals or client guidance.
Context impact: Low—discussion returns to re-engagement strategy on line 122.
Recommended action: REMOVE lines 117-121

MIXED/BORDERLINE SEGMENTS

[BORDERLINE #1 - Requires Review]
Location: Line 23
Content excerpt: “Thanks. Maria's coming, my boyfriend's coming, Justin's coming... and then there’s two potential clients... we only take one Austin client at a time...”
Business relevance argument: The policy about taking only one Austin client at a time and the presence of potential clients are relevant to capacity/territory strategy and pipeline.
Personal content argument: Listing who is attending (boyfriend, Maria) is personal/social and adds no business value.
Recommendation: KEEP the sentence(s) explaining the one-Austin-client policy and potential client attendance; REMOVE the purely personal attendance details (“Maria's coming, my boyfriend's coming, Justin's coming...”). Context remains clear.

[BORDERLINE #2 - Requires Review]
Location: Lines 75-79
Content excerpt:
“Luke: ...Oklahoma City is the 20th largest city... ahead of Nashville... Atlanta.
Team: That's not possible.
Luke: Maybe it's not...
Athena: Especially with as many businesses as we get from Atlanta...
Luke: ...don’t person Wikipedia... 63 third largest...”
Business relevance argument: They are brainstorming why OKC deal flow is thin; population comparisons can inform market outreach strategy (which they discuss on line 80 with a potential event).
Personal content argument: The population ranking banter and joking are tangential and contain inaccuracies.
Recommendation: KEEP (Low priority to remove). It serves as a segue to a concrete strategy idea (hosting a local event). If trimming for brevity, consider removing lines 76-79 but retain line 75 and line 80.

ADDITIONAL NOTES/PATTERNS FOR ASR IMPROVEMENT
- Acronyms: LOI/IOI/QoE/DD/504 frequently misheard (“Eli,” “QF,” “Q and D,” “low”). Train ASR on common M&A/SBA terminology.
- Legal terms: “indemnification” repeatedly distorted (“endemic vacation”).
- Industry terms: “HVAC” rendered as “H back.”
- Proper nouns: Company/person/venue names (“Ghettoitz,” “Dave Collinson/Collins,” “mean shares”) are unstable; consider custom vocabulary boost for known clients/partners.
- Homophones and filler: “look” vs “Luke,” “series” vs “serious,” “poodles” vs “potholes,” frequent truncation after fillers (“I mean,”).

This analysis prioritizes preserving all deal, client, financing, legal, and strategy content while removing non-business personal anecdotes and flagging high-impact transcription errors that could mislead reviewers.
