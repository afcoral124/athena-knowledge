Detailed transcription error reports

[Error #1 - Category: Misheard Acronym/Loan Program]
Location: ~00:01:20 / Speaker: Athena
Transcript excerpt: “...do you want the real estate in your 7 a, or do you want it in a 5 or 4 separately?”
Issue: “5 or 4” appears instead of “504” (CDC/504 loan); “7 a” spacing inconsistent.
Likely intended: “...in your 7(a), or do you want it in a 504 separately?”
Confidence: High
Reasoning: In SBA financing, the 504 loan is standard for real estate; ASR commonly splits “504” into “5 or 4.”
Impact: High – could confuse which financing program is referenced.

[Error #2 - Category: Omission/Business terminology]
Location: ~00:03:45–00:04:10 / Speaker: Athena
Transcript excerpt: “...you’re able to select. If it was cash or accounting, so then you can start comparing the tax returns...”
Issue: Phrase is incomplete; should specify accounting basis.
Likely intended: “...select whether it was cash or accrual accounting...”
Confidence: High
Reasoning: Standard comparison is cash vs accrual basis; “cash or accounting” is semantically incomplete.
Impact: Medium – affects clarity on a key input.

[Error #3 - Category: Business terminology distortion]
Location: ~00:08:05 / Speaker: Athena
Transcript excerpt: “...then your adjustments, which are the things that typically come, you know, your ad box from the, uh, broker or the seller...”
Issue: “ad box” likely misheard.
Likely intended: “add-backs”
Confidence: High
Reasoning: In SMB/M&A financials, “add-backs” is the standard term.
Impact: Medium-High – important for correct financial normalization.

[Error #4 - Category: Omission/Truncation + Misheard term]
Location: ~00:14:15–00:14:35 / Speaker: Athena
Transcript excerpt: “...what step up that you want to give them, what PREF, and what PREF. You correct. You want to start repaying the principal.”
Issue: Garbled phrase; “You correct.” out of place; missing word indicating timing.
Likely intended: “...what step-up you want to give them, what pref, and what period you want to start repaying the principal.”
Confidence: Medium
Reasoning: Investor terms typically include “pref” and when principal repayment begins; ASR often drops “period.”
Impact: Medium – obscures investor cash flow mechanics.

[Error #5 - Category: Misheard word (semantic)]
Location: ~00:15:30–00:15:55 / Speaker: Athena
Transcript excerpt: “...they’ll hold it for a certain number of deals and you can preset the multiple...”
Issue: “number of deals” mismatches the context of a buyout timeline.
Likely intended: “number of years”
Confidence: High
Reasoning: Rollover equity buyouts are time-based, not “number of deals.”
Impact: Medium

[Error #6 - Category: Homophone/misrecognition]
Location: ~00:16:55–00:17:15 / Speaker: Athena
Transcript excerpt: “...if things get a little bit hairier, Harry, you have it available.”
Issue: “Harry” appears instead of “hairy.”
Likely intended: “hairy”
Confidence: High
Reasoning: Common idiom “get hairy”; person name “Harry” is nonsensical.
Impact: Low

[Error #7 - Category: Misheard acronym]
Location: ~00:26:05–00:26:20 / Speaker: Athena
Transcript excerpt: “...it just looks like a straight up kind of simple P and O...”
Issue: “P and O” in financial context is likely wrong.
Likely intended: “P&L”
Confidence: High
Reasoning: She consistently references P&L elsewhere; “P and O” is not standard.
Impact: Medium

[Error #8 - Category: Misheard Acronym]
Location: ~00:20:15–00:20:35 / Speaker: Athena
Transcript excerpt: “...deal costs, your deal expenses... lawyers, QB, et cetera.”
Issue: “QB” is likely misheard for “QoE.”
Likely intended: “QoE” (Quality of Earnings)
Confidence: Medium-High
Reasoning: In acquisition deal costs, QoE is common; “QB” (QuickBooks) does not fit usual due diligence cost line items.
Impact: Medium

[Error #9 - Category: Misheard word (acronym)]
Location: ~00:32:00–00:32:25 / Speaker: Andrew
Transcript excerpt: “...here’s my desk service coverage. I have to be a 1 above 1, 1 and a half...”
Issue: “desk” instead of “debt.”
Likely intended: “debt service coverage”
Confidence: High
Reasoning: Industry standard term is “debt service coverage (ratio).”
Impact: Medium

[Error #10 - Category: Omission/garble]
Location: ~00:41:05–00:41:20 / Speaker: Athena
Transcript excerpt: “...we were able to and virus a little bit early.”
Issue: Garbled phrase.
Likely intended: “...we were able to end this a little bit early.” (or “end five or so minutes early”)
Confidence: Medium
Reasoning: Context is early wrap-up; “and virus” is nonsensical.
Impact: Low

[Error #11 - Category: Omission/Truncation]
Location: ~00:41:45–00:42:05 / Speaker: Athena
Transcript excerpt: “I can’t believe what a nerd I that this is literally the most exciting thing of my month.”
Issue: Missing verb.
Likely intended: “what a nerd I am — this is literally...”
Confidence: High
Reasoning: Common phrase; ASR often drops “am.”
Impact: Low

[Error #12 - Category: Semantic inconsistency]
Location: ~00:41:15 and ~00:43:00 / Speaker: Athena
Transcript excerpt: “...give you 14 minutes back...” then later “...enjoy the 12 minutes back.”
Issue: Conflicting time amounts.
Likely intended: Single consistent time returned (either 12 or 14 minutes).
Confidence: High
Reasoning: Two different values within ~2 minutes suggests ASR or ad-lib inconsistency.
Impact: Low

[Error #13 - Category: Misheard acronym (Borderline)]
Location: ~00:07:05–00:07:20 / Speaker: Athena
Transcript excerpt: “...pull out the P&Ls and you’re going to want it, or the SIM, depending on what financial statements that you have...”
Issue: “SIM” vs “CIM” (Confidential Information Memorandum).
Likely intended: “CIM” (or “SIM” if they standardize on Sales/Seller Info Memorandum)
Confidence: Medium
Reasoning: US M&A typically uses “CIM”; some brokers do say “SIM.” Needs context from org standards.
Impact: Low-Medium

Segments to remove

[REMOVAL #1 - Type: Small Talk/Opening pleasantries]
Location: 00:00:00–00:01:05
Speakers involved: Athena, Steve
Content excerpt:
“Athena: Hey Gil. Hello, I think people are rolling and I'm so excited. Hey, Steve.
Steve: Hey, I'm going to go on mute... I want to watch this because I'm so excited about it.
Athena: Yeah, me too. Oh Amazing cool Well, it's been a long time coming...”
Reasoning:
Pure greetings and expressions of excitement prior to substantive content; no business information yet.
Context impact: None—business overview begins immediately after.
Recommended action: REMOVE 00:00:00–00:01:05

[REMOVAL #2 - Type: Small Talk (Weather/Personal excitement)]
Location: ~00:41:15–00:41:35
Speakers involved: Athena
Content excerpt:
“I don’t know about where you all are. The sun is shining here. I’m so excited. So give you 14 minutes back.”
Reasoning:
Weather and personal excitement; not related to business or the model’s use.
Context impact: None—removal doesn’t affect instructions or Q&A.
Recommended action: REMOVE ~00:41:15–00:41:35

[REMOVAL #3 - Type: Small Talk/Personal aside]
Location: ~00:41:55–00:42:30
Speakers involved: Athena
Content excerpt:
“Oh, I saw Dustin said, this is awesome. Yay. I'm so excited. You guys are excited. I can't believe what a nerd I that this is literally the most exciting thing of my month. Maybe.”
Reasoning:
Compliments and self-deprecating humor; no business content.
Context impact: Low—does not affect understanding of the model or action items.
Recommended action: REMOVE ~00:41:55–00:42:30

[REMOVAL #4 - Type: Redundant closing pleasantries]
Location: ~00:42:55–00:43:10
Speakers involved: Athena, Justin
Content excerpt:
“Athena: Awesome. Great. Well, enjoy the 12 minutes back. We'll see you all next week. Bye.”
Reasoning:
Closing salutations only; purely social courtesy.
Context impact: None—meeting action item (use template) is already conveyed earlier.
Recommended action: REMOVE ~00:42:55–00:43:10

Borderline segments requiring review

[BORDERLINE #1 - Requires Review]
Location: ~00:01:05–00:01:20
Content excerpt: “Well, it's been a long time coming. This is a vision I've had for... How long have I been talking about this?...”
Business relevance argument: Brief context for the initiative’s importance and timeline; helps frame why the tool exists.
Personal content argument: Expressive, non-technical; could be considered hype rather than content.
Recommendation: KEEP — short and frames the rollout; not an extended tangent.

[BORDERLINE #2 - Requires Review]
Location: ~00:07:05–00:07:20
Content excerpt: “...pull out the P&Ls and... or the SIM, depending on what financial statements that you have...”
Business relevance argument: Directly about source docs to populate the model.
Personal content argument: Potential transcription error (“SIM” vs “CIM”); not small talk.
Recommendation: KEEP (but flag as potential acronym error — see Error #13)

[BORDERLINE #3 - Requires Review]
Location: ~00:29:55–00:30:10
Content excerpt: “Silence. Oh, um, so... does someone want to be a guinea pig...”
Business relevance argument: Transition to live modeling; sets up a practical exercise.
Personal content argument: The “Silence/um/guinea pig” phrasing is filler.
Recommendation: KEEP — functional meeting facilitation; removing could disrupt flow.

Speaker attribution validation
- Q&A dynamics appear consistent: Andrew asks about sharing outputs; Athena responds with solution ideas. Justin responds appropriately about readiness; Athena assigns homework. No strong evidence of speaker misattribution.

Cross-reference checks
- “7 a” vs “7A” vs “7(a)” usage is inconsistent but understandable; main mis-transcription is “5 or 4” (flagged).
- “P&L(s)” referenced consistently elsewhere; only “P and O” seems erroneous (flagged).
- Seller notes, equity injection, DSCR, SDE/EBITDA usage consistent with context.
- Time returned inconsistency (14 vs 12 minutes) flagged.

Patterns to note for ASR improvement
- Numerals and SBA programs: “504” misheard as “5 or 4”; “7(a)” spacing/casing inconsistent.
- Financial terms: “add-backs”→“ad box”; “debt”→“desk”; “P&L”→“P and O”.
- Common domain terms omitted: “accrual” after “cash or...”.
- Investor terms: “pref” and “period” garbled.
- Casual idioms: “hairy” misrecognized as “Harry”.
These suggest targeted language model tuning around SBA/M&A lexicon and numbers.
