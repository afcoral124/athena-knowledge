- Client name GL/Gil → “guild”
- Proper names: “Anka” appears as “Oka/Onka/Anka”
- Technical product terms in screen printing misrendered

Removals (Personal/Off-topic/Small talk)
Note: The call is overwhelmingly business-focused. The items below are short, optional trims; removing them will not affect comprehension.

---
[REMOVAL #1 - Type: Small Talk/Personal Aside]
Location: 14:20–14:31
Speakers involved: Athena, Luke
Content excerpt:
"Athena: Oh, nice. Oh, this feels like... that gives me the little, little tingle...
Luke: Yeah, I'm excited for this one."
Reasoning:
Expressive reactions; no added business substance beyond prior point (they like the deal).
Context impact: None
Recommended action: REMOVE 14:20–14:31

---
[REMOVAL #2 - Type: Small Talk/Personal Aside]
Location: 58:04–58:16
Speakers involved: Athena
Content excerpt:
"I'll turn up in my Chuck Taylor's and jeans and try to tone down the brake colors..."
Reasoning:
Personal clothing/style aside unrelated to deal strategy.
Context impact: None
Recommended action: REMOVE 58:04–58:16

---
[REMOVAL #3 - Type: Small Talk]

Speakers involved: Athena, Luke
Content excerpt:
"Athena: Cool. That's a really cute name. Smarty plants.
Luke: Oh, I know. This is for a destined. And Lindsey..."
Reasoning:
“Cute name” aside; minimal business value. The rest of the discussion about the business should be kept.
Context impact: Low
Recommended action: REMOVE 13:52–13:57 (keep subsequent explanation about the business)

Borderline segments (Requires Review)
---
[BORDERLINE #1 - Requires Review]
Location: 39:49–40:06
Content excerpt:
"Athena: ...I'm getting tingly about restoration. I don't know why... It can be absolutely phenomenal... added storage... increased revenue by 25%..."
Business relevance argument: Provides strategic rationale and a concrete growth lever (storage upsell); supports recommending restoration for Joe.
Personal content argument: Starts with a personal/emotional aside (“tingly”), and anecdotal tone.
Recommendation: KEEP — The substantive strategic content outweighs the brief personal lead-in.

---
[BORDERLINE #2 - Requires Review]
Location: 1:05:20–1:06:06
Content excerpt:
"Athena: I need to go in like two minutes... Dave Collins in list... Anka's going to follow up... hundreds of deals..."
Business relevance argument: Operational handoff and process for large list review (directly impacts pipeline).
Personal content argument: Some logistical chatter.
Recommendation: KEEP — Process/tactical content is relevant to deal flow.

Speaker attribution and context preservation notes
- “AcquiMatch Team” is used for multiple voices (likely Ryan and possibly others). Where policy decisions or client feedback are given, consider confirming which team member to avoid confusion in refinement.
- The “priority client vs. priority deal” section (45:20–46:30) is important policy guidance; ensure continuity if trimming unrelated asides.
- “Anka” name consistency will help preserve clarity on accountability (ops manager, follow-ups).

Additional checks recommended for human refiner
- Confirm whether “SIM/CIM” usage is consistent with team terminology; if standard is “CIM,” ensure initial occurrence expands acronym and usage is consistent.
- Verify whether “SPA” at 41:33 is a client initial set or misheard “SBA.”
- Confirm “GPB” entity reference and “Dave Collins” spelling.
- Where SDE and owner-replacement salary are discussed (27:43–29:56), ensure financial calculations and adjustments are clearly tied to SDE after replacing two owners.

Success-impacting items to prioritize for correction
- All QofE references (Errors #8, #13): High impact to diligence stage clarity.
- Loan brokers mishear (Error #3) and broker/broken (Error #5): Impacts meaning of sourcing strategy.
- Financial framing (Error #20: “425k SDE; 1.6M asking”): Critical for valuation understanding.
- Client initials/names consistency (GL/Gil; Anka): Affects action items and assignments.
