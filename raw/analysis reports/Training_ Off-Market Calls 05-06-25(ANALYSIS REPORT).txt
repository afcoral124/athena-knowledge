Detected Transcription Errors

[Error #1 - Category: Business terminology distortion / Nonsense word]
Location: 6:39 / Speaker: Luke Gillespie
Transcript excerpt: “...like instead of a specific script, do like, like I just talk off bullet points... introduce myself. It's out solšia. Yeah. Yeah. I have a client...”
Issue: “It's out solšia” is nonsensical in context
Likely intended: “establish credibility”
Confidence: Medium
Reasoning: He is listing bullet points; “Introduce myself” typically pairs with “establish credibility,” which Athena mentions elsewhere.
Impact: Medium – affects clarity of the recommended intro structure

[Error #2 - Category: Omission/Truncation]
Location: 13:35 / Speaker: Athena Simpson
Transcript excerpt: “If they haven't sent a trailing 12-month, then just change this to the most. This recent year and make sure this column is populated...”
Issue: Broken phrase “the most. This recent year”
Likely intended: “the most recent year”
Confidence: High
Reasoning: Standard phrasing when adjusting a financial template for the latest complete year.
Impact: Low – minor readability issue but clear intent

[Error #3 - Category: Financial/Numerical (date range)]
Location: ~14:05 / Speaker: Athena Simpson
Transcript excerpt: “...could you send me like the past 12 months from April, like from March, 2024 to April, 2025.”
Issue: Trailing 12 months given as March 2024–April 2025 (future-facing, 13 months)
Likely intended: A true TTM period such as April 2023–March 2024 or May 2023–April 2024
Confidence: High (error), Medium (exact intended dates)
Reasoning: She explicitly asks for TTM; the provided dates include a month in the future relative to early May and span 13 months.
Impact: High – TTM period is critical for accurate financial analysis

[Error #4 - Category: Business terminology distortion]
Location: 15:57 / Speaker: Athena Simpson
Transcript excerpt: “...your EBITDA shot at pretty considerably, like, you know, your cost of goods, like, apt, like, what happened there...”
Issue: “shot at” and “apt” appear misheard
Likely intended: “shot up pretty considerably” and “cost of goods up”
Confidence: High
Reasoning: Common financial phrasing when margins improve due to COGS changes.
Impact: Medium – obscures the financial point being made

[Error #5 - Category: Omission/Truncation]
Location: ~16:13–16:50 / Speaker: Athena Simpson
Transcript excerpt: “...what I need to add back is here's all the ad backs. already sent me. There's like 17 that I need to add...”
Issue: Missing subject before “already sent me”
Likely intended: “he’s already sent me”
Confidence: Medium
Reasoning: Prior context refers to the owner; pronoun likely dropped.
Impact: Low – intelligible but incomplete

[Error #6 - Category: Omission/Truncation]
Location: ~18:30 / Speaker: Athena Simpson
Transcript excerpt: “...What a nice service for them. You know, I start P&Ls. And then ask them about different things.”
Issue: Fragment “I start P&Ls”
Likely intended: “I start with the P&Ls”
Confidence: Medium
Reasoning: Matches earlier workflow description (“start with P&Ls”).
Impact: Low – minor clarity issue

[Error #7 - Category: Business terminology distortion]
Location: 22:28 / Speaker: Athena Simpson
Transcript excerpt: “...because you want to kind of like bread cummed. Okay. Give them the whole like synopsis...”
Issue: “bread cummed” is incorrect
Likely intended: “breadcrumb” (as a verb) or “breadcrumb it”
Confidence: High
Reasoning: In sales/process contexts “breadcrumb” is common; ASR likely split it.
Impact: Low – concept remains inferable

[Error #8 - Category: Omission/Semantic inconsistency]
Location: ~23:05–23:35 / Speaker: Athena Simpson
Transcript excerpt: “...I make sure that you understand my like what I'm just like to you. So this is a way for you to kind of show me that...”
Issue: Garbled clause; missing objects/subjects
Likely intended: “make sure that you understand what I’ve just explained to you”
Confidence: Medium
Reasoning: She’s describing a playback/confirmation method; wording is inconsistent.
Impact: Medium – reduces clarity of the instruction

[Error #9 - Category: Word substitution (Entity/term)]
Location: ~25:20–25:40 / Speaker: Athena Simpson
Transcript excerpt: “...we throw around terms like SDE and, you know, stock sale, asset sale. Like it means nothing, but like they probably don't know what Fathom means.”
Issue: “Fathom” likely misrecognized
Likely intended: “what that means”
Confidence: Medium-High
Reasoning: She’s discussing jargon owners may not understand; “Fathom” (the tool) does not fit syntactically.
Impact: Medium – could confuse readers about a tool vs. pronoun

[Error #10 - Category: Semantic inconsistency]
Location: 33:32 / Speaker: Luke Gillespie
Transcript excerpt: “...Maybe this is what you would call reverse tire.”
Issue: “reverse tire” does not fit known terminology
Likely intended: Possibly “reverse tire-kicker” or a different term for rushed sellers
Confidence: Low-Medium
Reasoning: “Tire-kicker” is common in sales; “reverse tire” may be ASR truncation.
Impact: Low – not critical to process understanding

[Error #11 - Category: Speaker Misattribution]
Location: 36:17 / Attributed Speaker: Luke Gillespie
Transcript excerpt: “It would be very good for you to watch and listen to.”
Issue: The sentence is advisory to Luke; fits Athena’s guidance flow
Likely intended: Speaker should be Athena Simpson
Confidence: High
Reasoning: Surrounding lines are Athena instructing Luke to watch objection content; this line continues that.
Impact: Medium – confuses who is guiding whom

[Error #12 - Category: Speaker Misattribution / Omission]
Location: 39:51 / Attributed Speaker: Luke Gillespie
Transcript excerpt: “So let me, you have the login information? Yeah. Okay, see if you can access that link.”
Issue: Line reads like Athena checking Luke’s access, not Luke speaking
Likely intended: Speaker should be Athena; possible truncation at start
Confidence: Medium
Reasoning: Neighboring lines show Athena helping Luke troubleshoot access.
Impact: Medium – minor role confusion

[Error #13 - Category: Omission/Truncation]
Location: 43:00 / Speaker: Luke Gillespie
Transcript excerpt: “And that's how he told.”
Issue: Incomplete clause
Likely intended: “And that’s how he told me [about it]” or similar
Confidence: Medium
Reasoning: Sentence trails off abruptly; missing object.
Impact: Low

[Error #14 - Category: Speaker Misattribution]
Location: 46:50 / Attributed Speaker: Luke Gillespie
Transcript excerpt: “Thanks, Luke. All right. Cool. Thanks a lot for taking the time...”
Issue: Luke would not address “Thanks, Luke” to himself
Likely intended: “Thanks, Luke” spoken by Athena; remainder likely Luke’s thanks
Confidence: High
Reasoning: Follow-on line (46:57) is Athena responding graciously to being thanked, indicating the “Thanks, Luke” belongs to her.
Impact: Medium – closing gratitude attribution mixed up

[Error #15 - Category: Redundancy/Glitch]
Location: 12:59 / Speaker: Luke Gillespie
Transcript excerpt: “Awesome. for listening. Thank Thank Thank Been wanting to get more hands on the financial modeling anyways.”
Issue: Repeated “Thank” and fragment “for listening”
Likely intended: Smooth acknowledgment (e.g., “Awesome, thanks... Been wanting...”)
Confidence: High
Reasoning: Typical ASR repetition/glitch; does not affect substance.
Impact: Low

[Error #16 - Category: Omission]
Location: 31:55 / Speaker: Athena Simpson
Transcript excerpt: “...there's a part of the process will inform you about, but it's called seller discretionary earnings.”
Issue: Missing connector “that” (“part of the process that we’ll inform you about”)
Likely intended: “there’s a part of the process that we’ll inform you about...”
Confidence: High
Reasoning: Common omission; meaning remains clear.
Impact: Low


REMOVAL Segments

- None recommended. The transcript is focused on process training, owner-call flow, financial analysis, objection handling, and internal enablement. Greetings/closings are brief and professional. Personal anecdote (founder’s parents) is used to build credibility and explain approach to owners, which is business-relevant in this context.


Borderline Segment(s)

[BORDERLINE #1 - Requires Review]
Location: ~26:36–28:56
Content excerpt: “...our founder, her parents shut down their business and her dad had a heart attack... they could have sold the business... we’re very passionate about making sure that business owners get...”
Business relevance argument: This personal story is used to establish credibility, empathy, and the firm’s mission/approach to owners—supports rapport and strategy for owner conversations.
Personal content argument: Includes sensitive family health details not strictly necessary to the process documentation.
Recommendation: KEEP — Serves a clear strategic/relationship-building purpose for owner outreach scripts; aligns with guidance on using personal context to explain business motivation.


Speaker Attribution Validation Summary

- Likely misattributions at 36:17, 39:51, and 46:50 cause minor role confusion. Recommend reviewer checks original audio to confirm and correct speaker labels for those lines.


Patterns/Notes for ASR Improvement

- Frequent truncations around connectors (“that,” “with,” “to”) leading to semantic glitches.
- Word substitutions: “breadcrumb” → “bread cummed”; “that” → “Fathom”; “shot up” → “shot at.”
- Date ranges for TTM were mis-captured; train model to validate temporal logic around “trailing 12 months.”
- Occasional speaker misattribution in rapid back-and-forth advisory exchanges.
- Repetition artifacts (“Thank Thank Thank”) indicate possible echo/noise-triggered duplication.
