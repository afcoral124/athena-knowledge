[Error #1 - Category: Business terminology distortion]
Location: 15:32-16:15 / Speaker: Anke Jordaan
Transcript excerpt: "…after the meeting is booked, I added in here the Indian bar profile call… familiarize yourself with the Indian bar profile for this deal…"
Issue: “Indian bar profile” is nonsensical in context
Likely intended: “NDA and buyer profile”
Confidence: High
Reasoning: The entire section is about signing NDAs and completing a buyer profile; “Indian/bar” is a common ASR mis-hear of NDA/buyer.
Impact: High – confuses key process steps for client setup

[Error #2 - Category: Business terminology distortion]
Location: 6:33-8:50 / Speaker: Anke Jordaan
Transcript excerpt: “…she actually filled in a buyer profile using Samantha Doe… So um, in, in, in this bar profile.”
Issue: “bar profile” appears repeatedly instead of the correct term
Likely intended: “buyer profile”
Confidence: High
Reasoning: The section consistently discusses buyer profiles; “bar” is a frequent ASR drop of the “-yer” syllable.
Impact: Medium – repeated terminology errors reduce clarity

[Error #3 - Category: Misheard word (finance)]
Location: 27:50-28:20 / Speaker: Athena Simpson
Transcript excerpt: “…they’ll get in the weeds of like, what’s the working cup? They said inventory is separate. Like Peter’s been spinning himself out on the inventory thing.”
Issue: “working cup” in a finance context is incorrect
Likely intended: “working cap” (short for working capital)
Confidence: High
Reasoning: Working capital and inventory treatment are frequently discussed together in acquisitions.
Impact: High – wrong finance term can mislead trainees

[Error #4 - Category: Misheard homophone]
Location: ~29:30-31:00 / Speaker: Athena Simpson
Transcript excerpt: “…our legacy clients have gotten in the habit of being able to reject deals before broker falls…”
Issue: “broker falls” instead of “broker calls”
Likely intended: “broker calls”
Confidence: High
Reasoning: The topic is sequencing broker calls; “falls” is a common ASR mishear of “calls.”
Impact: Medium – affects procedural clarity

[Error #5 - Category: Misheard word]
Location: 16:34 / Speaker: Anke Jordaan
Transcript excerpt: “…book the write-up review poll within 48 hours…”
Issue: “poll” in scheduling context is incorrect
Likely intended: “call”
Confidence: High
Reasoning: The process involves scheduling a review call, not a poll.
Impact: Medium – could confuse scheduling actions

[Error #6 - Category: Misheard word]
Location: 15:45-16:10 / Speaker: Anke Jordaan
Transcript excerpt: “…and then don’t send them the write-up without booking the school.”
Issue: “school” is incorrect in this context
Likely intended: “call”
Confidence: High
Reasoning: Matches the process of booking a follow-up call before sending the write-up.
Impact: Medium – scheduling confusion

[Error #7 - Category: Misheard homophone]
Location: ~37:10-38:00 / Speaker: Athena Simpson
Transcript excerpt: “…after a burger call, they can just get on, you know, on their phone, leave a voice note…”
Issue: “burger call” is nonsensical
Likely intended: “broker call”
Confidence: High
Reasoning: Entire section is about broker calls and feedback workflows.
Impact: Medium – minor but distracting

[Error #8 - Category: Entity name (company)]
Location: 3:00 / Speaker: Ryan Cash
Transcript excerpt: “…looking forward to another amazing day at Aquamatch.”
Issue: Company name transcribed incorrectly
Likely intended: “AcquiMatch”
Confidence: High
Reasoning: Official company name is AcquiMatch; “Aquamatch” is a common ASR error.
Impact: Medium – branding consistency

[Error #9 - Category: Entity name (company)]
Location: ~20:05 / Speaker: Athena Simpson
Transcript excerpt: “…put the link in there to their Acme Match buyer profile. The one that we made for them…”
Issue: Company name transcribed incorrectly
Likely intended: “AcquiMatch buyer profile”
Confidence: High
Reasoning: Consistent with brand; “Acme” is an ASR substitution.
Impact: Medium – branding consistency

[Error #10 - Category: Entity name (company)]
Location: 1:04:24 / Speaker: Anke Jordaan
Transcript excerpt: “They set up their Zoom accounts with their Acrimatch emails.”
Issue: Company name transcribed incorrectly
Likely intended: “AcquiMatch emails”
Confidence: High
Reasoning: Brand reference again distorted; “Acri-” is an ASR mistake.
Impact: Medium – branding consistency

[Error #11 - Category: Omission/Truncation (ASR garble)]
Location: 12:59 / Speaker: Anke Jordaan
Transcript excerpt: “Exp Cle докумens. just want we’re have ask I just added in, as part of the template, insert time booking link.”
Issue: Severe ASR corruption; includes non-English fragments
Likely intended: Administrative note about adding a booking link to the template
Confidence: High
Reasoning: Surrounding context is about using booking links in templates; current text is incoherent.
Impact: Medium – obscures operational instruction

[Error #12 - Category: Speaker misattribution]
Location: 2:16-2:22 / Speaker shown as: Luke Gillespie
Transcript excerpt: “And you, Luke, I know you love the sauna, but what do you do for movement? I like to go hiking.”
Issue: Speaker appears to address “Luke” while also answering
Likely intended: First sentence by another speaker (e.g., Anke), reply by Luke: “I like to go hiking.”
Confidence: High
Reasoning: A speaker would not address self in second person and then answer.
Impact: Low/Medium – creates mild confusion about who is speaking

[Error #13 - Category: Speaker misattribution / Truncation]
Location: 13:05-13:15 / Speakers: Athena Simpson / Anke Jordaan
Transcript excerpt: 
“Athena: Okay. So the template you sent Luke yesterday just said, would you be available at insert time?
Anke: So I’m just guessing why we’re not using booking links and or if these guys know how to set up booking links for themselves. I mean, I can add that…”
Issue: The question about “why we’re not using booking links” likely belongs to Athena; answer begins with Anke. The line merges question and answer under Anke.
Likely intended: Athena asks; Anke responds (“I can add that as part of the tech setup…”)
Confidence: Medium
Reasoning: Flow of Q&A indicates swap and merge.
Impact: Medium – confuses operational responsibility

[Error #14 - Category: Semantic inconsistency]
Location: 9:40-10:10 / Speaker: Athena Simpson
Transcript excerpt: “So brokers are basically gatekeeping. They get like hundreds of employees on deals right now… And then second of all, they use screen.”
Issue: “employees on deals” and “they use screen” are semantically wrong/incomplete
Likely intended: “hundreds of inquiries on deals” and “they use it to screen”
Confidence: High
Reasoning: In brokerage context, inquiries volume and screening are standard; “employees” makes no sense; missing “to” breaks meaning.
Impact: High – alters meaning of broker process

[Error #15 - Category: Semantic inconsistency]
Location: 19:46-20:05 / Speaker: Athena Simpson
Transcript excerpt: “I just shouted them for an hour and told them that.”
Issue: “shouted them” is unlikely in context of training
Likely intended: “showed them” or “walked them through it”
Confidence: Medium
Reasoning: She is describing training clients; “shouted” conflicts with tone and context.
Impact: Low/Medium – awkward, may confuse tone

[Error #16 - Category: Misheard word]
Location: 42:20-42:45 / Speaker: Anke Jordaan
Transcript excerpt: “…they have to prepare for the owner call, post the co-owner call feedback…”
Issue: “co-owner call feedback” doesn’t fit process
Likely intended: “owner call feedback”
Confidence: High
Reasoning: Process earlier distinguishes broker call, then owner call; “co-owner” is not a term used here.
Impact: Low/Medium – minor process confusion

[Error #17 - Category: Misheard word]
Location: 55:20-55:35 / Speaker: Athena Simpson
Transcript excerpt: “…see you guys at two past that. Power. Okay. Sounds good.”
Issue: “Power” at end of scheduling sentence is wrong
Likely intended: “hour”
Confidence: High
Reasoning: Refers to time resuming after break; “Power” is a phonetic mishear.
Impact: Low – trivial

[Error #18 - Category: Entity name (company/service)]
Location: 1:23:00-1:24:10 / Speaker: Athena Simpson
Transcript excerpt: “Susie from Guyton did a really great presentation on the Rob’s strategy. It’s on the buyer club’s replays.”
Issue: ROBS provider name likely mis-transcribed
Likely intended: “Guidant” (Guidant Financial) and “ROBS” (not “Rob’s”)
Confidence: High
Reasoning: Guidant Financial is a well-known ROBS provider; “Guyton” is phonetically similar; ROBS is standard acronym.
Impact: Medium – proper entity and acronym matter for follow-up

[Error #19 - Category: Grammar/ASR fragment (only because it obscures meaning)]
Location: 16:00-16:20 / Speaker: Anke Jordaan
Transcript excerpt: “…having them infindible know, keeping then the next step is the Explaining how to read and use a write-up.”
Issue: ASR fragment “infindible know, keeping…” garbles the instruction
Likely intended: Transitional guidance between completing forms and explaining the write-up
Confidence: High
Reasoning: The rest of the sentence outlines next procedural step; the fragment is nonsensical.
Impact: Medium – obscures procedural clarity

“Athena: …break everybody from saying good… feelings wheel… 
Ryan: It’s a beautiful Tuesday morning here in Houston… got up on time… make it on Zoom… looking forward to another amazing day at Aquamatch.”
Reasoning:
Mood/feelings small talk and non-substantive remarks about the day; no business relevance.

Location: 0:25-0:50
Speakers involved: Athena Simpson, Anke Jordaan

[BORDERLINE #1 - Requires Review]
Location: 1:01:12-1:03:40
Content excerpt: Discussion about staying in the Zoom room during breaks, waiting room monitoring, “hide non-video participants,” note takers view, hosting etiquette.
Business relevance argument: Operational guidance for running client-facing calls; improves professionalism and reduces client friction.
Personal content argument: Casual banter interleaved (“Oh, my gosh, Charis is back.”)
Recommendation: KEEP — Operationally relevant; any 1-2 line jokes are minimal and don’t justify removal.

[BORDERLINE #2 - Requires Review]
Location: 2:06:20-2:06:42
Content excerpt: “Luke, I’ll see you in 23 minutes… You got this, Luke… Woo!...”
Business relevance argument: Brief closing/encouragement before next training; standard meeting wrap-up.
Personal content argument: Cheerleading tone adds no substantive information.
Recommendation: KEEP — Brief professional closing; per guidelines brief closings are acceptable.

Pattern note (for ASR system improvement):
- “NDA and buyer profile” consistently mis-transcribed as “Indian bar/Indian bar profile/bar profile” across multiple instances (6:33-8:50, 15:32-16:15, 27:10-27:25). Suggest adding domain-specific lexicon for “NDA” and “buyer profile.”
- “Broker call” frequently misheard as “burger call” and “broker falls.” 
- Company name “AcquiMatch” repeatedly distorted as “Aquamatch,” “Acme Match,” “Acrimatch.”
- Finance terms (“working cap/working capital”) misheard as “working cup.”
- Various ASR garbles in administrative/process lines (e.g., 12:59), including insertion of non-English characters, and truncations that merge question/answer across speakers.

Speaker attribution note:
- At 2:16, a line labeled to Luke includes addressing “Luke” then answering; likely split across two speakers.
- At 13:05-13:15, the booking-links question and response appear to be merged/misattributed between Athena and Anke.

These corrections and removals will materially improve transcript clarity while preserving all business-relevant training content (processes for first write-ups, buyer profiles/NDAs, client coaching, financing/ROBS, broker call strategy, internal scorecard usage).
