[Error #1 - Category: Entity Name (Person)]
Location: ~00:00:10 / Speaker: Gil
Transcript excerpt: "Readings,"
Issue: "Readings" appears to be an ASR error during greeting.
Likely intended: "Greetings"
Confidence: High
Reasoning: "Greetings" is a common salutation; "Readings" is nonsensical in this context.
Impact: Low

---
[Error #2 - Category: Entity Name (Person)]
Location: ~00:00:45 / Speaker: Athena
Transcript excerpt: "Hey Federica. Welcome. ... How are you to Fire Club?"
Issue: Two issues: (a) Name rendered as "Federica" but later speaker is "Federico"; (b) phrase "How are you to Fire Club?" is garbled.
Likely intended: (a) "Federico"; (b) "How are you? Welcome to Buyer's Club."
Confidence: High (name), Medium (phrase)
Reasoning: The participant later speaks as "Federico." The phrase as transcribed is ungrammatical and mismatched to context.
Impact: Medium (name consistency aids clarity)

---
[Error #3 - Category: Entity Name (People)]
Location: 00:01:00–00:03:00 / Speakers: Athena, Polly, Gil
Transcript excerpt: "poll's here. Hey Polly." / "Pauly and Gil" / "Paul and Gill"
Issue: Inconsistent renderings of names: "Polly/Pauly/Paul" and "Gil/Gill"
Likely intended: "Polly" and "Gil"
Confidence: High
Reasoning: Subsequent references settle on “Polly” and “Gil.” Alternates are likely ASR spelling variants.
Impact: Medium

---
[Error #4 - Category: Semantic Inconsistency / Omission]
Location: ~00:02:20 / Speaker: Athena
Transcript excerpt: "Any anyone Spring The ability to rewatch is great."
Issue: Garbled phrase with extraneous word “Spring.”
Likely intended: "Anyone? The ability to rewatch is great."
Confidence: Medium
Reasoning: Nearby context is discussing rewatching past sessions; "Spring" is out of place.
Impact: Low

---
[Error #5 - Category: Misheard Acronym]
Location: ~00:05:40 / Speaker: Athena
Transcript excerpt: "like an earnout. But we can't do earnouts with SBI."
Issue: "SBI" in an SBA lending context.
Likely intended: "SBA"
Confidence: High
Reasoning: SBA (Small Business Administration) governs these loan rules; SBI is not applicable here. Common ASR error.
Impact: High

---
[Error #6 - Category: Misheard Acronym / Entity Name]
Location: ~00:11:40 / Speaker: Athena
Transcript excerpt: "if you were on Elliot's call or you rewatch Elliot Holman's call"
Issue: Likely mis-rendered name; well-known SMB due diligence expert is "Elliott Holland."
Likely intended: "Elliott Holland"
Confidence: High
Reasoning: Industry context (due diligence) strongly suggests Elliott Holland; “Holman” is likely an ASR slip.
Impact: Medium

---
[Error #7 - Category: Business Terminology Distortion]
Location: ~00:21:30–00:22:30 / Speaker: Athena
Transcript excerpt: "Cast your accrual." / "cash to approval adjustment."
Issue: Garbled accounting terms.
Likely intended: "cash to accrual adjustment"
Confidence: High
Reasoning: Converting cash-basis books to accrual-basis is standard; “approval” and “cast your” are ASR substitutions.
Impact: Medium

---
[Error #8 - Category: Business Terminology Distortion]
Location: ~00:19:10 / Speaker: Athena
Transcript excerpt: "August benefits, monthly support services."
Issue: "August benefits" is likely a mishear.
Likely intended: "Owner's benefits" (or "Owner benefits")
Confidence: Medium
Reasoning: In add-backs, “owner’s benefits” is standard; “August benefits” is contextually implausible.
Impact: Medium

---
[Error #9 - Category: Misheard Acronym]
Location: ~00:36:40 / Speaker: Athena
Transcript excerpt: "There’s a section in the LOI template..." and prior references to "qv"
Issue: Repeated references to “qv” for quality of earnings.
Likely intended: "QoE" or "Q of E"
Confidence: High
Reasoning: Standard acronym for Quality of Earnings is QoE; “qv” is an ASR artifact.
Impact: Medium

---
[Error #10 - Category: Speaker Misattribution / Nonsensical Insert]
Location: ~00:52:50–00:53:20 / Speaker: Ida
Transcript excerpt: "Yeah. 1, 1, 2, structure. One, one. It might be pulling These numbers here."
Issue: Fragmented, likely system/assistant notes mistakenly attributed as a speaker.
Likely intended: Not part of the spoken content (or belongs to Athena thinking aloud).
Confidence: Medium
Reasoning: Content is incoherent and interrupts modeling flow; appears like transcription glitch or background assistant.
Impact: Low

---
[Error #11 - Category: Misheard Acronym]
Location: ~00:22:40 / Speaker: Athena
Transcript excerpt: "SBA loans off tax returns."
Issue: Awkward phrasing; likely missing preposition.
Likely intended: "SBA loans are underwritten off tax returns" or "based on tax returns"
Confidence: Medium
Reasoning: Common phrasing in SBA lending; “off tax returns” without a verb is an ASR truncation.
Impact: Low

---
[Error #12 - Category: Semantic Inconsistency]
Location: ~00:01:30 / Speaker: Athena
Transcript excerpt: "it should be a fun when we're putting me on the spot"
Issue: Word choice/structure off; “fun when” likely “fun one” and “we’re” vs “you’re.”
Likely intended: "It should be a fun one; you're putting me on the spot"
Confidence: Medium
Reasoning: More natural phrasing in context of being featured to demo modeling.
Impact: Low

---
[Error #13 - Category: Entity Name (Person)]
Location: ~01:14:20 / Speaker: Athena
Transcript excerpt: "so Edita, let's look into that..."
Issue: Earlier interjections from "Ida;" name appears inconsistently as "Ida" vs "Edita."
Likely intended: One person (either "Ida" or "Edita"), consistent name needed
Confidence: Medium
Reasoning: The two forms appear to reference the same assistant; inconsistent ASR capture.
Impact: Low

---
[Error #14 - Category: Misheard Term]
Location: ~00:44:20 / Speaker: Athena
Transcript excerpt: "you can pretty much do whatever you want in terms of the terms. Um, and negotiate with them on insurance or, uh, on interest rates"
Issue: “insurance” likely misheard for “terms” or another deal component (e.g., “interest”).
Likely intended: "and negotiate with them on interest rate"
Confidence: Low
Reasoning: “Insurance” is unlikely in the immediate sentence after “terms” and before “interest rates”; may simply be a duplicated concept.
Impact: Low

Speaker Attribution Observations

- Several brief entries by "Ida" appear to be transcription artifacts or backstage prompts (e.g., “year by year,” “1, 1, 2, structure”). Consider verifying if these belong to Athena or should be removed as noise. Confidence: Medium.

Patterns to Flag for ASR Improvement

- SBA consistently misheard as “SBI” in at least one critical spot.
- Accounting terms “cash to accrual” repeatedly distorted (“cast your accrual,” “cash to approval”).
- Owner-related add-backs “owner’s benefits” misheard as “August benefits.”
- Inconsistent name spellings (Polly/Pauly/Paul; Gil/Gill; Federico/Federica; Ida/Edita).
- Proper name “Elliott Holland” misrendered as “Elliot Holman.”

---

Summary Impact

- High-impact errors: SBA→SBI; “cash to accrual adjustment” distortions; Elliott Holland name; name consistency for participants.
- Recommended removals focus on greetings and technical screen-management chatter to streamline transcript without losing business content.
- All key business discussions (financial modeling, add-backs, working capital, SBA standby change, seller notes, performance notes, DSCR, LOI assumptions) should be KEPT.
