Below is a focused audit of likely ASR (automatic speech recognition) errors and a mapping of business-relevant vs. off-topic segments, with explicit keep/remove recommendations.

TRANSCRIPTION ERRORS

[Error #1 - Category: Financial/Numerical]
Location: 19:48 / Speaker: Austin Lortie
Transcript excerpt: “if I do 7,000 divided by 6, we're charging, like, 12 grand a month.”
Issue: Dollar amount appears off by a factor of 10 given later context.
Likely intended: “if I do 70,000 divided by 6, we're charging, like, 12 grand a month.”
Confidence: High
Reasoning: $7,000/6 ≈ $1,167; only $70,000/6 ≈ $11,667 matches “12 grand.” The discussion centers on a $70k advance.
Impact: High – affects pricing clarity.

[Error #2 - Category: Entity Name]
Location: 31:20 / Speaker: Athena Simpson
Transcript excerpt: “Acquiro charges $65,000 up front and $150,000 overall.”
Issue: Likely misspelling of a well-known ETA firm.
Likely intended: “Acquira charges $65,000 up front and $150,000 overall.”
Confidence: High
Reasoning: Acquira (with an “a”) is a known buy-side accelerator in this space.
Impact: Medium – brand accuracy and comparables matter in pricing discussion.

[Error #3 - Category: Misheard Acronym]
Location: 47:08 / Speaker: Austin Lortie
Transcript excerpt: “So is that true for like QOV or attorney fees as well?”
Issue: QoE (Quality of Earnings) misheard as QOV.
Likely intended: “QoE”
Confidence: High
Reasoning: In M&A, QoE is standard; QOV is not a standard term.
Impact: High – core diligence terminology.

[Error #4 - Category: Business Terminology Distortion]
Location: 28:27 / Speaker: Austin Lortie
Transcript excerpt: “The five-season credit.”
Issue: Misrendered standard credit concept.
Likely intended: “the five Cs of credit”
Confidence: High
Reasoning: SBA and lender criteria are commonly referenced as the five Cs of credit.
Impact: High – key financing concept.

[Error #5 - Category: Business Terminology Distortion]
Location: 29:09 / Speaker: Austin Lortie
Transcript excerpt: “approached Wendy … to pre-call a loan for me.”
Issue: Loan prequalification misheard.
Likely intended: “pre-qual a loan”
Confidence: High
Reasoning: “Pre-qual” (prequalify) is standard; “pre-call” changes meaning.
Impact: Medium

[Error #6 - Category: Misheard Term]
Location: 44:28 / Speaker: Athena Simpson
Transcript excerpt: “so POS to get started, $70,000 advance…”
Issue: POS likely misheard.
Likely intended: “so cost to get started…”
Confidence: High
Reasoning: Slide headline refers to cost/pricing; “POS” (point-of-sale) makes no sense here.
Impact: Medium

[Error #7 - Category: Entity Name]
Location: 39:16 / Speaker: Austin Lortie
Transcript excerpt: “I’m Athena, founder of Aquamatch.”
Issue: Company name appears misspelled.
Likely intended: “AcquiMatch”
Confidence: High
Reasoning: Document header and context indicate AcquiMatch is the company.
Impact: Medium – brand consistency.

[Error #8 - Category: Entity/Terminology Name]
Location: 8:46–10:04 / Speaker: Athena Simpson
Transcript excerpt: “I ordered a Birini the other day… it's this baked rice dish…”
Issue: Indian dish name is off.
Likely intended: “Biryani”
Confidence: High
Reasoning: Biryani is the well-known baked rice dish described.
Impact: Low – off-topic segment, but accuracy note for ASR.

[Error #9 - Category: Entity Name]
Location: 10:04 / Speaker: Austin Lortie
Transcript excerpt: “the restaurant in Houston, it’s called Karan’s…”
Issue: Likely misheard restaurant name.
Likely intended: “Kiran’s”
Confidence: Medium
Reasoning: Kiran’s is a well-known Indian fine dining restaurant in Houston.
Impact: Low – off-topic.

[Error #10 - Category: Homophone/Misheard Word]
Location: 56:01 / Speaker: Austin Lortie
Transcript excerpt: “Something coughing on my brand new iPhone.”
Issue: Nonsensical phrase likely due to homophones.
Likely intended: “Spilled coffee on my brand new iPhone.”
Confidence: High
Reasoning: “coffee” vs. “coughing”; context is device mishap.
Impact: Low – off-topic.

[Error #11 - Category: Misheard Word]
Location: 57:10 / Speaker: Athena Simpson
Transcript excerpt: “I need to get you in the EBIT WhatsApp route.”
Issue: Group vs. route confusion.
Likely intended: “EBIT WhatsApp group”
Confidence: Medium
Reasoning: WhatsApp “group” is standard; “route” is odd here.
Impact: Low – internal ops clarity.

[Error #12 - Category: Entity Name Consistency]
Location: 36:19; 52:16; 1:12:56 / Speakers: Athena/Austin
Transcript excerpt: “Anka’s showed you…” vs. “Slack is better because then Anika and Kate have access…”
Issue: Inconsistent spelling of team member’s name (Anka/Anika).
Likely intended: One consistent spelling (Anka or Anika).
Confidence: Medium
Reasoning: Appears to reference the same person; inconsistent across transcript.
Impact: Medium – internal coordination.

[Error #13 - Category: Entity Name Consistency]
Location: 10:28 / Speaker: Athena Simpson
Transcript excerpt: “She remembers us and, you know, like, gives Jayden pretty stuff.”
Issue: Variance in spelling of Jaden/Jayden; and “pretty stuff” may be “free stuff.”
Likely intended: “Jayden” (consistent with earlier “Jaden”); possibly “free stuff.”
Confidence: Low-Medium
Reasoning: Name spelled both ways; “pretty stuff” odd; could be ASR artifact.
Impact: Low

[Error #14 - Category: Omission/Truncation]
Location: 25:56 / Speaker: Austin Lortie
Transcript excerpt: “I’ve with a few clients in terms of finding businesses…”
Issue: Missing verb.
Likely intended: “I’ve worked with a few clients…”
Confidence: High
Reasoning: Common collocation in context; ASR dropped a word.
Impact: Low-Medium

[Error #15 - Category: Semantic Inconsistency]
Location: 30:47 / Speaker: Austin Lortie
Transcript excerpt: “But the, uh, I’m you haven’t had to go to seven different lenders…”
Issue: Garbled transition words.
Likely intended: “But if you haven’t had to go to seven different lenders…”
Confidence: Medium
Reasoning: “I’m you” is ungrammatical; “if you” fits context.
Impact: Low

[Error #16 - Category: Business Terminology Distortion]
Location: 50:09 / Speaker: Austin Lortie
Transcript excerpt: “So your 10-year performance, that’s cool.”
Issue: Likely referring to a pro forma model.
Likely intended: “10-year pro forma”
Confidence: Medium
Reasoning: They’re discussing a financial model; “pro forma” aligns.
Impact: Low-Medium

[Error #17 - Category: Misheard Filler/Name]
Location: 56:43 / Speaker: Austin Lortie
Transcript excerpt: “Mario, like, I’m an Apple everything.”
Issue: “Mario” as filler is unlikely.
Likely intended: “Man, I’m an Apple everything” or “No, I’m an Apple everything.”
Confidence: Low-Medium
Reasoning: “Mario” doesn’t fit; typical filler would be “man,” “nah,” “no.”
Impact: Low


SEGMENT MAPPING (KEEP vs REMOVE vs MIXED)

Block A: 0:00–14:01
- Content: Furniture/Wayfair/Amazon, dogs on couch, Cole’s son’s age/health, US healthcare opinions, illness/antibiotics, veganism/restaurants (Houston/Austin/London), Indian food and travel (India), general travel stories (Japan), digital nomad door-to-door sales anecdote.
- Classification: REMOVE
- Reasoning: Extended personal life, food preferences, travel stories; no tie to business objectives.
- Context impact: Low – business discussion starts later.

Block B: 14:01–14:34
- Content: Digital nomad segue; Athena mentions the role is fully remote.
- Classification: MIXED (Borderline)
- Reasoning: Transition from personal travel to business operations (remote work model).
- Guidance: Keep from 14:15 onward where Athena states business is fully remote; remove preceding purely personal lead-in (see Borderline #1 below).

Block C: 14:34–17:42
- Content: Job satisfaction, role fit, sales career comments, hiring decision happiness, fear/confidence, “SBA changes the week I got hired.”
- Classification: KEEP
- Reasoning: Relates to role alignment, company operations, and training context; segues directly to SBA and pricing.

Block D: 17:42–18:14
- Content: Scheduling around anniversary and haircut; confirming event day (Fri/Sat).
- Classification: MIXED
- Reasoning: Event timing is operational; anniversary/haircut is personal.
- Guidance: Keep only the event day clarification lines; remove personal (see Removal #2 and line-level detail below).

Block E: 18:14–1:25:50 (remainder)
- Content: Pricing model, SBA SOP implications, success fee constraints, value justification, lender perspective (Live Oak/Wendy), five Cs of credit, due diligence, comps (Big 4, Acquira), deck formatting, screen sharing, video walkthrough, financial model, DD tracker, Slack/tasks/trackers, intro/exploration call prep, text/SMS/HubSpot process, geographic/industry scope limits, client readiness, objection handling, assumptive language, quotas/targets/comp, time to close, next steps.
- Classification: KEEP
- Reasoning: Substantive business operations, financing, sales process, product offering, internal tooling, client handling, and training topics.

REMOVALS

[REMOVAL #1 - Type: Personal/Off-Topic]
Location: 0:00–14:01
Speakers involved: Austin Lortie, Athena Simpson
Content excerpt:
“Athena: …getting some new things delivered for the office… Wayfair and Amazon…”
“Austin: …we have a Bernedoodle and he just destroyed it…”
“Athena: …Cole has two big dogs…”
“…vegan restaurants… Indian food… London… Michelin level…”
“…I’d love to go to India… Japan trip story…”
Reasoning:
Extended small talk on furniture, pets, vegan/restaurant preferences, and travel anecdotes; no connection to acquisitions, financing, or client work.
Context impact: Low – business topics begin later.
Recommended action: REMOVE 0:00–14:01

[REMOVAL #2 - Type: Small Talk]
Location: 17:42–18:14 (partial)
Speakers involved: Austin, Athena
Content excerpt:
“Austin: …do you care if I cut out a little early today? Because it is my anniversary…”
“Athena: Happy anniversary.”
“Austin: …we’re gonna go do dinner… get a haircut…”
Reasoning:
Personal scheduling and celebration details; not business-relevant.
Context impact: Low – retain only the event-day clarification immediately after.
Recommended action: REMOVE 17:42–18:04 and 18:11–18:14; KEEP 18:04–18:11 (“Was it Friday or Saturday…?” / “No, it’s Saturday.”)

[REMOVAL #3 - Type: Personal/Off-Topic]
Location: 56:01–57:06
Speakers involved: Austin, Athena
Content excerpt:
“Austin: …Something coughing on my brand new iPhone…”
“Athena: I’m a Pixel girl.”
“Austin: I’m an Apple fanboy.”
“Athena: …hate Apple products… very first Google phone…”
Reasoning:
Device banter; off-topic.
Context impact: Low – conversation returns to business (WhatsApp group and leads).
Recommended action: REMOVE 56:01–57:06

BORDERLINE SEGMENTS

[BORDERLINE #1 - Requires Review]
Location: 14:01–14:34
Content excerpt: “I really wish that like the digital nomad thing… you can with this job… fully remote…”
Business relevance argument: Establishes remote nature of role and delivery model—organizational ops context relevant to internal training.
Personal content argument: Starts as personal travel/digital nomad reminiscence.
Recommendation: KEEP 14:15–14:34 (remote-work explanation); REMOVE 14:01–14:15 (preceding personal tangent).

[BORDERLINE #2 - Requires Review]
Location: 17:42–18:14 (subset)
Content excerpt: “Was it Friday or Saturday that event? … No, it’s Saturday.”
Business relevance argument: Confirms work event timing/logistics.
Personal content argument: Surrounding lines are about anniversary and haircut.
Recommendation: KEEP only 18:04–18:11 (event day Q&A); REMOVE adjacent personal lines as outlined in Removal #2.

ADDITIONAL NOTES AND PATTERNS

- Recurrent ASR issues with acronyms/terms: SBA/SOP context handled correctly, but “QoE,” “five Cs of credit,” and “pre-qual” were misheard. Flag this as a systematic area to improve.
- Proper nouns: Company name “AcquiMatch” appears as “Aquamatch”; “Acquira” appears as “Acquiro”; “Kiran’s” likely misheard as “Karan’s”; team member name appears as “Anka” and “Anika”; “Jaden/Jayden” inconsistent. These should be standardized during refinement.
- Minor truncations and filler misreads: Several lines show dropped words or odd fillers (“Position Position,” “I’ve with a few clients,” “I’m you”), suggesting either crosstalk or audio artifacts; reviewers should listen to confirm.
- Context preservation: The recommended removals won’t disrupt the flow; the first removal excises a clean pre-business block, the second surgically removes personal chatter while retaining event scheduling, and the third removes a short off-topic detour before resuming business tooling discussion.

This report prioritizes errors affecting business meaning (pricing math, terminology, entities) and provides precise boundaries to streamline the transcript while preserving all deal, financing, sales process, and operational content.
