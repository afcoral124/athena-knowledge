Removals
- None recommended. Personal content present is brief and/or directly tied to business rapport-building, deal scheduling, or process/education (KEEP per guidelines).

Borderline segments (Requires Review)

[BORDERLINE #1 - Requires Review]
Location: ~00:03:35–00:04:20 (Chris)
Content excerpt: "…let's go to a social setting and hopefully break bread… either grab a beer or do dinner… pizza… or some Italian food… and then having some beverage and talking about sports."
Business relevance argument: Discusses planned rapport-building approach with sellers to advance negotiations and assess fit—directly tied to deal strategy.
Personal content argument: Specific food/sports references could be seen as off-topic social detail.
Recommendation: KEEP — The social specifics serve a strategic business purpose (relationship building before LOI); removing may diminish context of approach.

Patterns to note for ASR improvement
- Misheard acronyms/names: LOI→LOII, IOI→IIOI, S-Corp→SCORP, EST→ESD, NAICS→“Any CIS/NACE”, Ryan→Brian.
- Garbled business terms: “valuation consultant” rendered as “That out evaluation consultant…”
- Idioms/phrases distorted: “irons in the fire” misrendered; repeated words (“distribute distributor”).

Context preservation notes
- All sections marked KEEP form a coherent flow from deal updates to strategy to educational modeling. Removing the borderline rapport lines would slightly reduce clarity on Chris’s approach; recommend retaining for context.
