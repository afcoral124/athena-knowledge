Detected transcription errors (prioritized)
[Error #1 - Category: Misheard Acronym (pattern)]
Location: Multiple
- 00:02:00 Athena: “…Chris Barrett, who is epic at doing QVs and all things finance and due diligence.”
- 00:03:50 Chris: “I’m excited to talk a little about Q of E’s.”
- 00:05:50 Athena: “…before you actually order a QV from someone like Chris…”
- 01:03:05 Athena: “…before you order a QB.”
- 01:02:10 Chris: “…When I’m doing the QAB, I want full access…”
- 00:21:40 Chris: “…working through a quality ratings report.”
Issue: QoE (Quality of Earnings) is inconsistently rendered as “QV,” “QB,” “QAB,” “QAV,” or “quality ratings report.”
Likely intended: “QoE,” “QoE report,” or “quality of earnings report”
Confidence: High
Reasoning: QoE is the standard term for quality of earnings; “QB” often denotes QuickBooks but context here is diligence. “Quality ratings report” is not a standard term in this context.
Impact: High – could mislead readers about the service being discussed.

[Error #2 - Category: Misheard Acronym]
Location: 01:05:25 / Speaker: Chris
Transcript excerpt: “…get it funded by an SBO.”
Issue: “SBO” used in the context of government-backed lending for acquisitions.
Likely intended: “SBA”
Confidence: High
Reasoning: SBA loans are repeatedly referenced; “SBO” is not a loan program.
Impact: High – can confuse financing references.

[Error #3 - Category: Financial Terminology Distortion (pattern)]
Location: Multiple / Speaker: Chris
- 00:08:45: “…especially work and capital, it’s always a really big one.”
- 00:34:40: “…ballpark with the seller on networking capital…”
Issue: “work and capital” and “networking capital” used instead of “working capital.”
Likely intended: “working capital”
Confidence: High
Reasoning: Topic is working capital targets/negotiations; “networking capital” is a common ASR error.
Impact: High – core concept of the talk.

[Error #4 - Category: Misheard Acronym]
Location: 00:31:10 / Speaker: Chris
Transcript excerpt: “…it ended up having over a 200,000 impact on eBay because they were recognizing revenue improperly.”
Issue: “eBay” used in place of earnings metric.
Likely intended: “EBITDA”
Confidence: High
Reasoning: He’s quantifying an EBITDA impact from revenue recognition adjustments.
Impact: High – changes financial meaning.

[Error #5 - Category: Business Terminology Distortion]
Location: 00:21:40 / Speaker: Chris
Transcript excerpt: “…working through a quality ratings report.”
Issue: Non-standard term.
Likely intended: “quality of earnings report”
Confidence: High
Reasoning: Industry-standard phrasing is “QoE report.”
Impact: Medium – clarity of diligence deliverable.

[Error #6 - Category: Misheard Term (Industry)]
Location: 00:03:55 / Speaker: Chris
Transcript excerpt: “…light manufacturing deals and SAS businesses and e commerce…”
Issue: “SAS” and spacing of “e commerce.”
Likely intended: “SaaS businesses and e-commerce”
Confidence: High
Reasoning: SaaS is the standard acronym; “SAS” changes the meaning (analytics company or misspelling).
Impact: Medium

[Error #7 - Category: Misheard Term (Accounting)]
Location: 00:49:55 / Speaker: Chris
Transcript excerpt: “…on their balance sheet, you should see things like, uh, costs and excess of billings and billings and excess of costs…”
Issue: Phrases slightly off earlier; elsewhere said “cost nexus of billings,” which is incorrect.
Likely intended: “costs in excess of billings” and “billings in excess of costs”
Confidence: High
Reasoning: Standard WIP/contract accounting terms.
Impact: Medium – technical accuracy.

[Error #8 - Category: Misheard Acronym/Term]
Location: 00:35:15 / Speaker: Chris
Transcript excerpt: “…tying the stem into the tax returns, tying the books to the tax returns…”
Issue: “stem” in context of reconciling marketing documents to tax.
Likely intended: “CIM” (Confidential Information Memorandum)
Confidence: High
Reasoning: Buyers reconcile CIM figures to tax returns; “stem” is an ASR artifact.
Impact: Medium

[Error #9 - Category: Misheard Acronym]
Location: 01:02:00 / Speaker: Chris
Transcript excerpt: “Pre LLI, they’re probably not going to give you mom’s financials.”
Issue: “LLI” and “mom’s” in one sentence.
Likely intended: “pre-LOI” and “monthly financials”
Confidence: High
Reasoning: Pre-LOI vs post-LOI info access; “mom’s” is a common ASR miss for “monthlies.”
Impact: Medium

[Error #10 - Category: Misheard Phrase]
Location: 01:14:05 / Speaker: Chris
Transcript excerpt: “If I buy this business and I have That accounts to you will include it.”
Issue: Garbled phrase; unclear referent.
Likely intended: “If I buy this business and I have that accounts receivable included…”
Confidence: High
Reasoning: Context is explaining why AR included provides immediate inflows post-close.
Impact: Medium

[Error #11 - Category: Semantic Inconsistency/Homophone]
Location: 00:22:05 / Speaker: Athena
Transcript excerpt: “if Joe mind on these 3 points, the correcting errors.”
Issue: “Joe” and grammar don’t fit.
Likely intended: “if you don’t mind, on these three points—the correcting errors…”
Confidence: Medium
Reasoning: She’s asking Chris to explain revenue recognition; “Joe” doesn’t fit, no “Joe” speaking then.
Impact: Low

[Error #12 - Category: Misheard Acronym]
Location: 01:03:05 / Speaker: Athena
Transcript excerpt: “…before you order a QB.”
Issue: “QB” ambiguous (QuickBooks vs QoE).
Likely intended: “QoE”
Confidence: High
Reasoning: Context is ordering a diligence report, not QuickBooks.
Impact: Medium

[Error #13 - Category: Misheard Acronym]
Location: 01:07:05 / Speaker: Chris
Transcript excerpt: “average deal for SBAs. For around 15 K for QB”
Issue: “SBAs” plural and “QB.”
Likely intended: “SBA” and “QoE”
Confidence: High
Reasoning: Referring to SBA-sized deals; QB is not the deliverable here.
Impact: Medium

[Error #14 - Category: Misheard Term (Industry)]
Location: 01:08:10 / Speaker: Chris
Transcript excerpt: “we did a 20 million dubcon deal recently. That was 25.”
Issue: “dubcon” not a standard industry label.
Likely intended: “GovCon” (government contracting)
Confidence: Medium
Reasoning: “GovCon” is common M&A vertical; “dubcon” is likely phonetic misrendering.
Impact: Medium

[Error #15 - Category: Misheard Phrase]
Location: 00:57:05 / Speaker: Chris
Transcript excerpt: “…if you grab the train, like 12 month period…”
Issue: “train, like 12 month” is malformed.
Likely intended: “trailing 12-month period”
Confidence: High
Reasoning: Standard financial analysis timeframe.
Impact: Medium

[Error #16 - Category: Speaker/Name Confusion]
Location: ~00:01:00 / Speakers: Athena, Ryan
Transcript excerpt:
Athena: “Can you, I think that’s Joe.”
Ryan: “Sorry.”
Athena: “That’s all right, Joe. Hello.”
Issue: The late joiner seems to be Ryan, yet addressed as “Joe.” Potential misnaming/misattribution.
Likely intended: Addressing Ryan (not Joe)
Confidence: Medium
Reasoning: Ryan says “Sorry” after the call-out; Athena continues addressing “Joe.”
Impact: Low – minimal effect on business content.


Segments recommended for removal
[REMOVAL #1 - Type: Small Talk/Joiner Interruption]
Location: ~00:00:55–00:01:05
Speakers involved: Athena, Ryan
Content excerpt:
“Athena: Okay. Um, can you, I think that’s Joe.
Ryan: Sorry.
Athena: That’s all right, Joe. Hello.”
Reasoning:
Brief joiner apology/hello that adds no business value. Removing it tightens the intro without losing context.
Context impact: None
Recommended action: REMOVE ~00:00:55–00:01:05


Borderline segments (requires review)
[BORDERLINE #1 - Requires Review]
Location: ~01:10:50–01:11:20 (Jason’s seller motivation)
Content excerpt: “He wants to sell the business so he could buy a house, be closer to his kids and his grandkids.”
Business relevance argument: Seller motivation/commitment is material to likelihood of closing, timeline, and negotiation dynamics.
Personal content argument: Involves the seller’s family and personal life.
Recommendation: KEEP — Motivation for sale is directly relevant to deal risk and negotiation strategy.


Additional notes on patterns for ASR improvement
- QoE consistently misheard as QV/QB/QAB/QAV or generalized as “quality ratings report.”
- SBA misheard as SBO (and pluralized as “SBAs”).
- Working capital frequently appears as “work and capital” or “networking capital.”
- SaaS misheard as SAS; e-commerce spacing inconsistent.
- CIM misheard as SIM/STEM.
- Technical accounting terms (“costs in excess of billings/billings in excess of costs,” “trailing 12-month”) frequently distorted.
- Several short garbles/omissions produce ungrammatical fragments in critical explanations (e.g., AR inclusion sentence).

Speaker attribution validation
- Overall speaker flow is logical (Athena facilitates, Chris presents, participants ask). The only notable confusion is the brief “Joe” vs Ryan joiner moment (Error #16). It does not affect business content.

Cross-reference consistency
- Core concepts repeated consistently by speakers (working capital, revenue recognition, QoE scope). However, inconsistent acronym renderings (QoE, SBA, CIM) should be standardized upon refinement.
- Numerical references appear internally consistent (e.g., $8M to $4M renegotiation; $200K EBITDA impact example; pricing ranges for QoE), though one industry term (“dubcon”) is suspect (likely “GovCon”).

Summary of keep/remove stance
- Keep all business content, Q&A, and even brief professional closings.
- Remove only the tiny joiner interruption (REMOVAL #1).
- Borderline personal motivation: KEEP for business relevance.
