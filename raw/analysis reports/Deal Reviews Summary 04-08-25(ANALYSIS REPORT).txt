[Error #1 - Category: Misheard Acronym]
Location: 8:11 / Speaker: Athena Simpson
Transcript excerpt: "...how is the pipeline going to know if somebody submitted an ally?"
Issue: "ally" used in deal context
Likely intended: "LOI" (Letter of Intent)
Confidence: High
Reasoning: Within M&A, LOI is the standard term; "ally" has no relevance here.
Impact: High

[Error #2 - Category: Misheard Acronym]
Location: 10:22 / Speaker: Athena Simpson
Transcript excerpt: "...matter of a deal getting done or an all while you're getting submitted..."
Issue: "all while" in acquisition process context
Likely intended: "LOI"
Confidence: High
Reasoning: LOI submission timing is a frequent gating item; "all while" is nonsensical here.
Impact: High

[Error #3 - Category: Misheard Acronym]
Location: 24:01 / Speaker: Luke Gillespie
Transcript excerpt: "...they're all SDA lenders, they have different types of risk..."
Issue: "SDA" instead of SBA
Likely intended: "SBA"
Confidence: High
Reasoning: Context is U.S. small business acquisition financing; SBA lenders vary by risk appetite.
Impact: High

[Error #4 - Category: Misheard Acronym]
Location: 26:19 / Speaker: Luke Gillespie
Transcript excerpt: "the broker claimed they already had a couple of LIs in hand..."
Issue: "LIs" likely intended as LOIs
Likely intended: "LOIs" (Letters of Intent)
Confidence: High
Reasoning: In M&A, LOIs are standard; "LIs" is a common ASR truncation.
Impact: Medium

[Error #5 - Category: Financial/Numerical Distortion]
Location: 25:25 / Speaker: Luke Gillespie
Transcript excerpt: "...in 2024, it was 622 K at that sales commissions... that's a nine in that six hundred twenty degree out of the nine hundred twenty five SDE."
Issue: Garbled amounts/ratios; unclear relationship to SDE
Likely intended: "In 2024, $622K in sales commissions; that's $622K of $925K SDE."
Confidence: Medium
Reasoning: Prior sentence mentions $622K commissions; SDE of ~$925K fits typical ratios; the phrasing is corrupted.
Impact: High

[Error #6 - Category: Entity Name]
Location: 20:15 / Speaker: David R
Transcript excerpt: "...I do have Georgia in East Coast, be it by sale."
Issue: "be it by sale" is not a known marketplace
Likely intended: "BizBuySell"
Confidence: High
Reasoning: BizBuySell is the major U.S. small business listing marketplace; phonetic match likely misheard.
Impact: High

[Error #7 - Category: Entity Name]
Location: 33:00 / Speaker: Luke Gillespie
Transcript excerpt: "It was an e-commerce company... It's a website closed with his deal."
Issue: "website closed with his deal" is nonsensical
Likely intended: "It's a Website Closers deal."
Confidence: High
Reasoning: Website Closers is a known brokerage for e-commerce businesses; context fits.
Impact: High

[Error #8 - Category: Entity Name]
Location: 5:55-6:05 / Speaker: Athena Simpson
Transcript excerpt: "...I know Oka is doing the daily meeting with you..."
Issue: "Oka" likely misheard colleague name
Likely intended: "Anka"
Confidence: High
Reasoning: The same colleague is repeatedly referenced as "Anka" later; consistent with internal team member.
Impact: Medium

[Error #9 - Category: Entity Name + Homophone]
Location: 14:03 / Speaker: Luke Gillespie
Transcript excerpt: "No, the call knows that Eda does in the client channels for every call."
Issue: “call knows” vs “call notes”; “Eda” likely wrong name
Likely intended: "No, the call notes that Anka does in the client channels for every call."
Confidence: Medium
Reasoning: They reference Fathom call notes and Anka preparing notes; “knows/notes” is a common ASR homophone error.
Impact: Medium

[Error #10 - Category: Business Terminology Distortion]
Location: 37:00 / Speaker: Luke Gillespie (pattern recurs at 41:59)
Transcript excerpt: "...introduce them to the broker to do a broker call... Should I... get you on a burger call..."
Issue: "burger call" instead of "broker call"
Likely intended: "broker call"
Confidence: High
Reasoning: Standard next step is a broker call; repeated mishearing appears throughout.
Impact: Medium

[Error #11 - Category: Misheard Acronym/Term]
Location: 31:38 / Speaker: Luke Gillespie
Transcript excerpt: "...he just sent a message in the slide channel..."
Issue: "slide channel" in messaging context
Likely intended: "Slack channel"
Confidence: High
Reasoning: Team references Slack repeatedly; “slide” is a phonetic error.
Impact: Low

Location: 27:24 and 28:40 / Speaker: Athena Simpson
Transcript excerpt: "...have they done their 2024?... they haven't done the 2024 tax returns..."
Issue: Year likely off; April 08 implies 2023 returns are relevant
Likely intended: "2023 tax returns"
Confidence: Medium
Reasoning: In April, current-year (2024) returns aren’t due; lenders request prior-year (2023) returns for underwriting.
Impact: Medium

[Error #13 - Category: Entity/Proper Noun]
Location: 44:30 / Speaker: Athena Simpson
Transcript excerpt: "There’s something I realized that S and BASH..."
Issue: Conference name misrendered
Likely intended: "SMBash"
Confidence: High

Impact: Low

[Error #14 - Category: Entity/Name Consistency]
Location: 46:12 and 45:57 / Speakers: Luke, Athena
Transcript excerpt: "Instruct Gill to send questions..."; "gill message back..."
Issue: Inconsistent spelling/capitalization of name

Impact: Low

[Error #15 - Category: Homophone/Word Error]
Location: 0:42 / Speaker: Luke Gillespie
Transcript excerpt: "...he's a pro-tenant. He played a tournament..."
Issue: "pro-tenant" in sports context
Likely intended: "pro tennis [player]"

Impact: Low (in small-talk section)

[Error #16 - Category: Homophone]
Location: 2:48 / Speaker: David R
Transcript excerpt: "We have a coca spaniel."
Issue: "coca spaniel"
Likely intended: "cocker spaniel"

Location: 3:04 / Speaker: Athena Simpson
Transcript excerpt: "...little like teacup noodles..."
Issue: "noodles" in pet context
Likely intended: "poodles"
Confidence: High
Reasoning: Teacup poodles are a common dog; “noodles” is misheard.
Impact: Low (in small-talk section)

[Error #18 - Category: Omissions/Truncations + Homophones]
Location: 4:50 / Speaker: Luke Gillespie
Transcript excerpt: "You want to see my mom? So you get these Clorox wipes. them on the floor. And you step and you just  running around your food..."
Issue: Multiple garbles ("mom" vs "mop"; missing verbs; "food" vs "foot"; "heartless floor"; "getting a moment")
Likely intended: Cleaning hack with Clorox wipes used as a “mop” on hardwood floor
Confidence: Medium
Reasoning: The entire sentence is corrupted by ASR; context from adjacent lines clarifies.
Impact: Low (in small-talk section)

[Error #19 - Category: Homophone]
Location: 5:48 / Speaker: Luke Gillespie
Transcript excerpt: "I love it, I'm so middle-wollist."

Segment Mapping and Removals

[REMOVAL #1 - Type: Personal/Off-Topic]
Location: 0:00 - 5:55
Speakers involved: Athena, Luke, David
Content excerpt:
"Athena: ...So where in Mexico are you? You're in Mexico City?
Luke: Mexico City, yes.
Athena: When did you get there?
Luke: Saturday, Saturday night.
Athena: How does it go in?
Luke: It's great... getting all the essentials...
[...]
David R: ...we have a dog so we just take care of the dog.
Athena: ...what's your wife's name?
David R: ...Paola...
[...]
Athena: ...my boyfriend... two huge dogs...
[...]
Luke: You want to see my mom? So you get these Clorox wipes...
Athena: Like the college version of a Swiffer a Mop...
Luke: ...I'm so middle-wollist."
Reasoning:
Extended personal small talk about travel, living arrangements, pets, household cleaning, and relationships with no connection to business, clients, deals, or operations.
Context impact: None—conversation clearly transitions to business at 5:55 (“...wanted to talk about a few things going on with the client...”).
Recommended action: REMOVE 0:00 - 5:55


[BORDERLINE #1 - Requires Review]
Location: 5:55 - 6:20
Content excerpt: "Well, cool. So, yeah. wanted to talk about a few things going on with the client... And then, you know, any deals or anything that you guys wanted to talk through today..."
Business relevance argument: This marks the transition into business agenda, client matters, pipeline tracking, and data cleanliness.
Personal content argument: Brief mention of “I haven’t had a social catch up” and eating lunch.
Recommendation: KEEP — The brief personal asides serve as transition; the segment immediately focuses on business operations and client work.


Additional Notes and Patterns
- Repeated LOI mishearing (ally/all while) is a significant pattern; ensure reviewers pay special attention to LOI occurrences across transcripts.
- “Broker call” repeatedly appears as “burger call”; this recurring distortion can mislead readers unfamiliar with context.
- Team member name “Anka” appears misheard as “Oka” and possibly “Eda”; confirm correct names for team documentation.
- Ensure brokerage/marketplace names are standardized: BizBuySell; Website Closers; SMBash.
- Consider standardizing “HubSpot” capitalization in final deliverables (low priority).
- One message references “slide channel” instead of Slack; standardize to Slack in internal notes.

Speaker Attribution
- No clear cases of swapped speakers; the odd line “I was on David.” (0:23, David R) appears to be an ASR corruption rather than misattribution. If needed, reviewers can verify original audio.

Omissions/Truncations
- Several early small-talk lines (0:37-5:00) show broken phrases and missing words, likely due to audio/noise. These fall within the removal segment and do not affect business content.

This analysis prioritizes errors affecting deal understanding (LOI/SBA, financial figures, entity names) and removes only extended off-topic content while preserving business flow.
