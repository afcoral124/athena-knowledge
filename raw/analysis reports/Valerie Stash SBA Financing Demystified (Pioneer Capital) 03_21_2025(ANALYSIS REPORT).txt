Detected transcription errors

---
[Error #1 - Category: Misheard Acronym]
Location: ~00:02:30 / Speaker: Valerie
Transcript excerpt: "I'm not new to the SVA. space at all. I've been, um, in SBA lending for almost 10 years…"
Issue: “SVA” appears instead of “SBA” in an SBA lending context.
Likely intended: “SBA”
Confidence: High
Reasoning: SBA is the standard acronym; “SVA” is a common ASR confusion.
Impact: Medium (could momentarily confuse readers)

---
[Error #2 - Category: Misheard Acronym]
Location: ~00:18:15 / Speaker: Valerie
Transcript excerpt: "A lot of people are like, okay, I've got the signed yellow. I, what is getting to underwriting look like?"
Issue: “yellow. I” in place of LOI (Letter of Intent).
Likely intended: “LOI”
Confidence: High
Reasoning: LOI is standard in M&A; phonetic mishear is common.
Impact: High (LOI is a key stage in the process)

---
[Error #3 - Category: Business Terminology Distortion]
Location: ~00:20:00 / Speaker: Valerie
Transcript excerpt: "Perry Passeau is, um, like where you do an SBA loan combined with a conventional loan."
Issue: “Perry Passeau” is a phonetic distortion.
Likely intended: “pari passu”
Confidence: High
Reasoning: In SBA/conventional stack, “pari passu” is the correct term.
Impact: Medium (technical term clarity)

---
[Error #4 - Category: Business Terminology Distortion]
Location: ~00:08:40 / Speaker: Valerie
Transcript excerpt: "it's got the, uh, the debt severage debt service coverage ratios, um, in there…"
Issue: “debt severage” is not a relevant term; duplication with “debt service coverage ratios.”
Likely intended: “debt service coverage ratios”
Confidence: High
Reasoning: DSCR is the relevant metric; “severage” is an ASR artifact.
Impact: Medium

---
[Error #5 - Category: Misheard Acronym/Homophone (Pattern)]
Location: ~01:11:20 and ~01:12:20 / Speaker: Valerie
Transcript excerpt: "I even have clients who have taken out heel locks on their rental properties…"
Issue: “heel lock(s)” in place of HELOC(s) (Home Equity Line of Credit).
Likely intended: “HELOC(s)”
Confidence: High
Reasoning: Repeated substitutions; context is collateral/lines of credit.
Impact: High (financial instrument reference)

---
[Error #6 - Category: Semantic Inconsistency]
Location: ~00:01:40 / Speaker: Athena
Transcript excerpt: "…Valerie is going to allow us with her magic in terms of what she actually takes us through."
Issue: “allow us with her magic” is awkward; likely wrong verb.
Likely intended: “wow us” or “wow us with her magic”
Confidence: Medium
Reasoning: Idiomatic usage suggests “wow us”; “allow us” doesn’t fit context.
Impact: Low

---
[Error #7 - Category: Semantic Inconsistency]
Location: ~00:00:45 / Speaker: Athena (opening)
Transcript excerpt: "Yeah, actually probably did 2 shows under offer."
Issue: “2 shows under offer” is incongruent with deal context.
Likely intended: “two deals under offer” or “two shops under LOI”
Confidence: Medium
Reasoning: Prior line references deals/updates; “shows” is out of place.
Impact: Medium

---
[Error #8 - Category: Omissions/Truncations (Timestamp Insertion)]
Location: ~00:01:00 / Speaker: Athena
Transcript excerpt: "…working as a, uh, an SBA [00:01:00] lender and then has been a broker…"
Issue: Timestamp token inserted mid‑sentence.
Likely intended: Timestamp should be outside sentences or at speaker turn transitions.
Confidence: High
Reasoning: Formatting artifact; interrupts sentence flow.
Impact: Low (readability)

---
[Error #9 - Category: Omissions/Truncations]
Location: ~00:02:00 / Speaker: Athena
Transcript excerpt: "…I know [00:02:00] you're just a wealth of amazing. Uh, knowledge…"
Issue: Sentence break “amazing. Uh, knowledge” is malformed; timestamp mid‑clause.
Likely intended: “a wealth of amazing knowledge”
Confidence: High
Reasoning: Incomplete noun phrase due to timestamp/period insertion.
Impact: Low–Medium

---
[Error #10 - Category: Omissions/Truncations]
Location: ~00:15:05 / Speaker: Valerie
Transcript excerpt: "…because we've just passed the 2024, business for, I think like March 15th or so."
Issue: “2024, business for” is truncated; missing “tax return filing deadline.”
Likely intended: “we've just passed the 2024 business tax return filing deadline (March 15th)”
Confidence: Medium
Reasoning: Topic is lender requests for 2024 tax returns post‑deadline.
Impact: Low–Medium

---
[Error #11 - Category: Financial/Numerical Error]
Location: ~00:29:10 / Speaker: Valerie
Transcript excerpt: "…it needs to be on a two year standby and it needs to, um, followed with an eight year amortization…"
Issue: “eight year amortization” likely incorrect in this SBA context (commonly 10 years or matches term). Could be ASR mishear of “10‑year amortization.”
Likely intended: “10‑year amortization” (or “amortized thereafter”)
Confidence: Medium
Reasoning: SBA seller notes that count as equity typically require 24 months full standby; amortization often matches business acquisition terms (~10 years).
Impact: Medium (may mislead readers structuring seller notes)

---
[Error #12 - Category: Misheard Rate Phrase]
Location: ~01:20:35 / Speaker: Valerie
Transcript excerpt: "…Can you come at prime point 1. 5 plus 1. 5? He was able to talk to his management and get it."
Issue: Rate phrase malformed; duplication suggests ASR error.
Likely intended: “prime + 1.5%”
Confidence: High
Reasoning: Standard quoting is “prime plus X”; “point 1.5 plus 1.5” is ill‑formed.
Impact: Medium

---
[Error #13 - Category: Misheard Acronym (Borderline)]
Location: ~00:16:20 / Speaker: Valerie
Transcript excerpt: "We also like to see a copy of the SIM, if applicable."
Issue: “SIM” vs. commonly “CIM” (Confidential Information Memorandum). Some brokers do say “SIM.”
Likely intended: “CIM” (but “SIM” may be intentional)
Confidence: Low
Reasoning: Usage varies by firm. Potential confusion for readers expecting “CIM.”
Impact: Low

Segments recommended for removal

---
[REMOVAL #1 - Type: Small Talk]
Location: ~00:00:00–~00:00:25
Speakers involved: Athena
Content excerpt:
"Athena: Hello. Hello. Hello. Welcome. Welcome. Hey, Polly. How's it going? How are you? Oh, good. Thank you. Um, looks like Joe and Justin are here as well. Hey, Justin, how you doing?"
Reasoning:
Pure social pleasantries before the meeting content begins. No business value, and removal won’t break context; the next lines immediately shift to business updates.
Context impact: None
Recommended action: REMOVE ~first 2–3 sentences up to “…Hey, Justin, how you doing?”

---

Borderline segments (requires review)

---
[BORDERLINE #1 - Requires Review]
Location: ~00:44:40–~00:46:20
Content excerpt: "…when I was at SBA loan closer… every time we close the deal, we have like this DJ air horn that we would play… pre‑COVID… we were all super excited that we closed the loan… how this is going to change someone's life…"
Business relevance argument: Humanizes the closing process and underscores the significance of reaching closing; supports the theme of patience/persistence.
Personal content argument: Anecdotal, culture/storytelling; not necessary to understand SBA steps or terms.
Recommendation: KEEP — brief motivational anecdote; does not materially lengthen transcript.

---
[BORDERLINE #2 - Requires Review]
Location: ~00:02:40–~00:03:10
Content excerpt: "…I'm a little bit nervous… who doesn't get nervous presenting for the first time?…"
Business relevance argument: Builds rapport; explains presentation style/pace.
Personal content argument: Purely personal; not needed for financing/process understanding.
Recommendation: KEEP — very brief; helps tone without harming flow.

---
[BORDERLINE #3 - Requires Review]
Location: ~01:27:20–~01:27:50
Content excerpt: "…I come from a entrepreneurial background… my family… they've all started businesses… this is really exciting…"
Business relevance argument: Establishes credibility/empathy; encourages buyers.
Personal content argument: Personal background; not required for deal execution.
Recommendation: KEEP — short, motivational, and aligned with audience.

Speaker attribution validation
- No clear speaker swaps detected; Q&A segments align logically (clients ask; Valerie answers).
- Early opening line “Yeah, actually probably did 2 shows under offer” lacks clear attribution but does not create role confusion.

Cross‑reference consistency
- Acronyms: SBA, LOI, DSCR used consistently except flagged errors (SVA, “yellow. I”).
- HELOC repeatedly misheard as “heel lock(s)” (pattern).
- “pari passu” consistently mis‑rendered as “Perry Passeau” (pattern).
- Rates: “prime + 2.25,” “prime + 2.5,” and “prime + 1.5” appear; one malformed instance flagged.

Technical audio/ASR pattern notes
- Mid‑sentence timestamp tokens (e.g., [00:01:00], [00:02:00]) appear inserted into sentences, suggesting automated timestamping overlapped with ASR.
- Systematic acronym confusions: LOI→“yellow. I”; HELOC→“heel lock”; SBA→“SVA”; pari passu→“Perry Passeau”; QoE→“QV”/“Q of E”.
- Occasional duplicated/garbled words (“debt severage debt service…”; malformed rate phrase) indicate ASR stumble on jargon and numbers.

Summary
- High‑impact errors primarily involve acronyms/terms (LOI, HELOC, SBA, pari passu) and one likely numerical/amortization mishear.
- Content is overwhelmingly business‑relevant; only the opening greetings merit small talk removal. Borderline personal anecdotes are brief and support the business narrative; recommend keeping.
