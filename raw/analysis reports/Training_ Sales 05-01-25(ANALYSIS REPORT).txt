Transcription error reports

[Error #1 - Category: Entity name (company)]
Location: ~6:45–7:20 / Speaker: Austin
Transcript excerpt: "...and there's really gone all in on Aquamatch and supporting first time business buyers like yourself..."
Issue: Company name appears as “Aquamatch.”
Likely intended: “AcquiMatch”
Confidence: High
Reasoning: The organization in context is AcquiMatch; “Aquamatch” is a common phonetic/orthographic slip.
Impact: High – central entity name.

[Error #2 - Category: Proper noun misheard]
Location: 13:20–13:40 / Speaker: Austin
Transcript excerpt: "I think had to do with like Mossad and then Ida's name. Ida and Anka's name specifically."
Issue: “Mossad” is almost certainly not intended (refers to Israel’s intelligence service).
Likely intended: A person’s name (e.g., “Masan/Massad/Mosaad/Mossam”) on the team.
Confidence: High
Reasoning: Context is staff names; “Mossad” is semantically incongruent.
Impact: Medium – confuses who is being referenced.

[Error #3 - Category: Proper noun inconsistency (pattern)]
Location: 14:20–14:40 / Speaker: Athena
Transcript excerpt: "And then Masam has an... Entire team behind them. So I got an entire team for paying $5 an hour..."
Issue: “Masam” likely same person referenced as “Mossad” above; inconsistent spelling.
Likely intended: Same individual (e.g., “Masan/Mossam/Massad”) across both mentions.
Confidence: Medium
Reasoning: Same role context; two different transcriptions suggest ASR inconsistency on the same name.
Impact: Medium – continuity of who/what team is referenced.

[Error #4 - Category: Semantic inconsistency]
Location: 1:30–1:40 / Speaker: Austin
Transcript excerpt: "I just need to, like, clean up my net line a little bit and then, like, throw on some slacks..."
Issue: “net line” is unclear in context (scheduling/getting ready to leave).
Likely intended: Possibly “LinkedIn,” “inbox,” or “pipeline” (work task) or “neckline” (clothing).
Confidence: Low
Reasoning: Phrase is not idiomatic; multiple plausible intents. Context suggests work or getting-ready tasks.
Impact: Low – minor clarity issue.

[Error #5 - Category: Misheard acronym]
Location: 32:22–32:44 / Speakers: Athena/Austin
Transcript excerpt: "Okay, so that's, like, the GVT spit out of, like, the reviewing, like, the past call? ... So, like, are you doing the GPT summary? Yeah, okay."
Issue: “GVT” appears; later corrected in-dialogue to “GPT.”
Likely intended: “GPT”
Confidence: High
Reasoning: They explicitly reference GPT summary immediately after.
Impact: Medium – could confuse what tool is being discussed.

[Error #6 - Category: Truncation/Omission]
Location: 31:06 / Speaker: Austin
Transcript excerpt: "Explow with Morgan tomorrow, and then my next intro is Monday."
Issue: “Explow” appears truncated.
Likely intended: “Exploratory (call)”
Confidence: High
Reasoning: Common internal shorthand (“intro vs exploratory”); “explow” is not standard.
Impact: Low – understandable but sloppy.

[Error #7 - Category: Financial/numerical error]
Location: 34:45–35:10 / Speaker: Athena
Transcript excerpt: "when I came to him, I was, I was telling people it was five days a month."
Issue: Pricing stated in “days” is illogical for fees discussion.
Likely intended: “$5k a month”
Confidence: High
Reasoning: Pricing model context and industry norms (fee per month) strongly indicate “$5k,” not “five days.”
Impact: High – materially alters pricing meaning.

[Error #8 - Category: Financial/numerical error]
Location: ~35:10–35:25 / Speaker: Athena
Transcript excerpt: "he's like, don't they have like three to 500 to invest?"
Issue: “three to 500” lacks units/context; likely liquidity range.
Likely intended: “$300k to $500k”
Confidence: Medium
Reasoning: ETA/SBA acquisitions typically require ~10–20% equity; liquidity often cited as $300–500k. Nearby discussion is about 6-month paid-in-full pricing, ability to invest.
Impact: High – important to assess buyer capacity.

[Error #9 - Category: Repetition/Audio artifact]
Location: 40:47–41:06 / Speaker: Athena
Transcript excerpt: "And yeah, how... Thank you. Thank you. you. Thank you. Thank you. you. you. Thank you. You How about that?"
Issue: Nonsensical repeated “Thank you” sequence.
Likely intended: A single acknowledgment; filler; or brief confirmation.
Confidence: High
Reasoning: Clear ASR glitch/loop; not conversationally coherent.
Impact: Low – just noise.

[Error #10 - Category: Business terminology distortion]
Location: 39:49 / Speaker: Austin
Transcript excerpt: "Let's just change this. The title in the slide to, like. Let's be a structure..."
Issue: “Let’s be a structure” likely misheard slide title.
Likely intended: “SBA structure”
Confidence: High
Reasoning: Ongoing discussion about SBA loan structure/equity injection and “Sources & Uses” slide titles.
Impact: Medium – affects slide content clarity.

[Error #11 - Category: Terminology inconsistency]
Location: 41:24–41:58 / Speaker: Austin
Transcript excerpt: "...then LOI results and testimony."
Issue: “testimony” vs “testimonials” (later they say “My testimonials is the only one.”).
Likely intended: “testimonials”
Confidence: High
Reasoning: Slide/content type; buyer proof; “testimonials” is standard.
Impact: Low–Medium – could mislead on slide content.

[Error #12 - Category: Inconsistency (meeting name)]
Location: 1:46 vs 50:44 / Speaker: Athena
Transcript excerpts: 
- "The Players Club today is going to be with Mathias and Valerie from Pioneer Capital."
- "I got to go to the bathroom before Buyer's Club."
Issue: Meeting referenced as “Players Club” and later “Buyer's Club.”
Likely intended: One of these (same meeting) is misheard.
Confidence: Medium
Reasoning: Same day/adjacent timing; same context; plausible single event, inconsistent name.
Impact: Medium – meeting coordination.

[Error #13 - Category: Omission/Truncation]
Location: 41:31 / Speaker: Austin
Transcript excerpt: "It is post basic transition. So team you'll review, look at the partner slide..."
Issue: Phrase is syntactically incomplete (“post basic transition”) and unclear.
Likely intended: Possibly “post-basics transition” section title and agenda items.
Confidence: Low–Medium
Reasoning: Slide sequencing context; phrase seems clipped.
Impact: Low–Medium – slide review clarity.

[Error #14 - Category: Misheard acronym/name]
Location: 4:00 / Speaker: Athena
Transcript excerpt: "SM Bash a couple weeks ago said, you know, if you're doing this on your own..."
Issue: Conference name likely “SMBash.”
Likely intended: “SMBash”
Confidence: High
Reasoning: SMBash is a known SMB/ETA conference.
Impact: Low – reference clarity.

[Error #15 - Category: Misheard proper noun]
Location: 29:22 / Speaker: Athena
Transcript excerpt: "You're already talking to main shares. They're probably your best bet right now..."
Issue: “main shares” unclear; likely a firm name misheard.
Likely intended: Possibly “Main Street” (lender/broker brand) or a specific firm name.
Confidence: Low–Medium
Reasoning: ETA ecosystem has “Main Street” lenders/advisors; “main shares” is not recognizable.
Impact: Medium – could misidentify a third-party.

[Error #16 - Category: Misheard word/Name]
Location: 45:31 / Speaker: Austin
Transcript excerpt: "I just feel like I'm your first sales. Sarah, I'm the first salesperson that you're training..."
Issue: “Sarah” appears abruptly; not a known participant; likely interjection misheard.
Likely intended: “So yeah,” or “so I’m...”
Confidence: Medium
Reasoning: Sequence reads as stammer/filler; “Sarah” is not elsewhere referenced as a person in this context.
Impact: Low – readability.

[Error #17 - Category: Tool/annotation misattribution]
Location: 1:30 / Speaker: Austin
Transcript excerpt: "ACTION ITEM: Attend Players Club call w/ Mathias & Valerie from Pioneer Capital re SBA SOP guidelines - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/289532279?timestamp=97.9999"
Issue: Action-item annotation likely inserted by a meeting assistant tool, not spoken content.
Likely intended: Tool-generated note separate from Austin’s utterance.
Confidence: High
Reasoning: Formatting and link structure typical of automated meeting notes, not speech.
Impact: Low – but relevant for transcript cleanup/attribution.

Segments to remove

[REMOVAL #1 - Type: Small Talk/Personal]
Location: 0:00–1:30
Speakers involved: Austin, Athena
Content excerpt:
"Austin: So I'm feeling human... 
Athena: It's going to be a non-negotiable... I've been letting my schedule creep...
Austin: I need to get on that grind.
Athena: ...my business is going to fall apart if I don't take care of myself... 
Austin: ...we have a heavy bag and like a kettlebell set up in our garage... I played a lot of tennis growing up.
Athena: I was literally just throwing kettlebells around..."
Reasoning:
Extended personal wellness and exercise chat; not connected to business acquisition, sales process, clients, or financing.
Context impact: None – conversation transitions into meeting logistics and business topics afterward.
Recommended action: REMOVE 0:00–1:30

[REMOVAL #2 - Type: Off-Topic/Artifact]
Location: 40:47–41:06
Speakers involved: Athena
Content excerpt:
"And yeah, how... Thank you. Thank you. you. Thank you. Thank you. you. you. Thank you. You How about that?"
Reasoning:
Clear ASR glitch resulting in repeated words; provides no business meaning.
Context impact: None – removal does not affect comprehension of surrounding slide-title discussion.
Recommended action: REMOVE 40:47–41:06

[REMOVAL #3 - Type: Personal/Small Aside]
Location: 50:44–50:47 (single line within closing)
Speakers involved: Athena
Content excerpt:
"So, I got to jump. I got to go to the bathroom before Buyer's Club."
Reasoning:
Brief personal remark unrelated to business content or logistics.
Context impact: None – retain surrounding scheduling/closing lines.
Recommended action: REMOVE 50:44–50:47 (only this sentence)

Mixed segment with line-level guidance

[MIXED Segment - Requires line-level keep/remove]
Location: 1:30–2:02 / Speaker: Austin
Content excerpt:
"At 3? Nothing necessarily. I just need to, like, clean up my net line a little bit and then, like, throw on some slacks before I head into the city.
ACTION ITEM: Attend Players Club call w/ Mathias & Valerie from Pioneer Capital re SBA SOP guidelines
- WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/289532279?timestamp=97.9999
And then I'm driving during rush hour, so I was trying to leave here at, like, 4 or so to be a little early."
Keep vs Remove:
- KEEP: The ACTION ITEM line and link (business-relevant; ties to SBA SOP updates).
- REMOVE: The surrounding personal scheduling clothing/traffic remarks (no business value).
Boundary recommendation:
- REMOVE: “At 3? Nothing necessarily...” through “...before I head into the city.” and “And then I'm driving during rush hour...” through “...to be a little early.”
- KEEP: The ACTION ITEM line and link only.
Context impact: Low – preserving the action item maintains business continuity.

Borderline segments (requires review)

[BORDERLINE #1 - Requires Review]
Location: 33:54–36:42
Content excerpt:
"...six month PIF... I now I spend money on things that help me save time. Like I paid for meal prep... local PA in Austin... car wash and Amazon returns... focus on the $1,000 an hour instead of the $22 an hour..."
Business relevance argument:
Illustrates time-leverage rationale tied to pricing/value framing and buyer mindset; supports sales narrative.
Personal content argument:
Contains extended personal lifestyle details (meal prep, car wash) that are not strictly necessary for the business point.
Recommendation: KEEP with minor tightening if editing is allowed; otherwise keep as-is (adds color to the value framing).

[BORDERLINE #2 - Requires Review]
Location: 24:24–25:30
Content excerpt:
Discussion of a prospect’s resume (20 years at one company, equity from strategic exit), perceived risk tolerance.
Business relevance argument:
Client fit assessment is core to qualifying; links to coachability and likelihood of success.
Personal content argument:
Tone becomes personal/critical; details may be more than needed.
Recommendation: KEEP – directly informs client qualification and service alignment.

[BORDERLINE #3 - Requires Review]
Location: 16:46–17:32
Content excerpt:
Observations about competitors’ demeanor and business posture (Acquisition Lab team, “martyrdom,” event anecdotes).
Business relevance argument:
Industry context and competitor positioning can inform sales approach and messaging.
Personal content argument:
Leans into subjective impressions; could be seen as gossip.
Recommendation: KEEP – offers market/competitor insight relevant to strategy; avoid heavy redaction unless required by policy.

Additional notes/patterns for ASR improvement
- Consistent issues with acronyms/initialisms: GPT→GVT; SBA structure garbled to “Let’s be a structure”; SMBash segmented; LOI-related terms fine elsewhere.
- Proper nouns and names frequently misheard: Company (AcquiMatch), person names (Mossad/Masam?), product/firms (“main shares”). Consider custom vocabulary for frequent names (team members, partners, communities like SMBash).
- Numerical expressions in pricing/investment contexts are unreliable: “five days a month” (likely $5k/mo); “three to 500” (likely $300–500k). Encourage reviewers to double-check all numbers in pricing/financing discussions.
- Tool annotations (ACTION ITEM / WATCH) appear inline under a speaker; recommend separating tool-generated notes from spoken content in the transcript.

End result
- High-impact errors have been flagged with context and likely intended meanings.
- Non-business small talk and artifacts identified with precise remove boundaries.
- Borderline segments evaluated conservatively to preserve business-relevant context.
