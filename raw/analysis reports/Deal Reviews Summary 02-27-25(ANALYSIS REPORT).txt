[Error #1 - Category: Misheard Acronym]
Location: 10:26 / Speaker: AcquiMatch Team
Transcript excerpt: "She was on vacation last week... You know, she got an SBA prequel. So, I just kind of talked her up..."
Issue: "prequel" in lending context
Likely intended: "SBA pre-qual" (prequalification)
Confidence: High

Impact: Medium

---
[Error #2 - Category: Business Terminology Distortion]
Location: 31:17 / Speaker: Athena Simpson
Transcript excerpt: "And why are we not exploring a seller now on this one? If it's not financeable by SBA."
Issue: "seller now" in financing context
Likely intended: "seller note"
Confidence: High

Impact: High

---
[Error #3 - Category: Business Terminology Distortion]
Location: 31:36 / Speaker: Luke Gillespie
Transcript excerpt: "The broker said 10 to 20% seller knows it should be reasonable."
Issue: "seller knows" in place of a financing instrument

Impact: High

---
[Error #4 - Category: Misheard Acronym]
Location: 48:16 / Speaker: AcquiMatch Team
Transcript excerpt: "Online business... around like four or five million dollars. That's doing about a million and e-bitter."
Issue: "e-bitter" in financial performance context
Likely intended: "EBITDA"
Confidence: High
Reasoning: EBITDA is the standard profitability metric; “e-bitter” is a typical ASR rendering.
Impact: High

---
[Error #5 - Category: Misheard Acronym]
Location: 56:43 / Speaker: Athena Simpson
Transcript excerpt: "The report, the broker reports are lower. Like, if you look at the IVBA quarterly report..."
Issue: "IVBA" in place of industry association acronym
Likely intended: "IBBA" (International Business Brokers Association)
Confidence: High
Reasoning: IBBA produces well-known quarterly market reports; “IVBA” is incorrect.
Impact: Medium

---
[Error #6 - Category: Entity Name]
Location: 36:00-36:20 / Speaker: AcquiMatch Team
Transcript excerpt: "And then I just explained what Accuimatch does. We primarily look to utilize SBA..."
Issue: Company name spelled phonetically/incorrectly
Likely intended: "AcquiMatch"
Confidence: High
Reasoning: Internal company name; consistent proper spelling elsewhere.
Impact: Low

---
[Error #7 - Category: Entity Name]
Location: 19:58-20:28 / Speaker: Athena Simpson
Transcript excerpt: "He won't even go on acquiring mines... he won't do it because the guy was so concerned..."
Issue: Proper noun for podcast misrendered
Likely intended: "Acquiring Minds"
Confidence: Medium-High

Impact: Low

---
[Error #8 - Category: Omissions and Truncations]
Location: 32:14-32:30 / Speaker: AcquiMatch Team
Transcript excerpt: "...No, the seller so I think that's primarily because Fylender if they're if the seller of the buyer that they're Lending to needs to pursue a lawsuit..."
Issue: Garbled phrasing ("Fylender", "seller of the buyer"), missing connectors
Likely intended: "If a lender… if the seller or the buyer they’re lending to needs to pursue a lawsuit..."
Confidence: Medium
Reasoning: Multiple broken clauses indicate ASR dropouts and word substitutions.
Impact: Medium

---
[Error #9 - Category: Financial and Numerical Error]
Location: 47:21-47:28 / Speaker: AcquiMatch Team
Transcript excerpt: "Help me be 7% and I'm, I mean, I'm not good. No, I'm saying they could tell me that..."
Issue: Incoherent numeric statement around interest rate
Likely intended: A comparison to typical SBA rates (~7-10%) or “It won’t be 7%...”
Confidence: Medium
Reasoning: Surrounding discussion is about non-SBA rates vs SBA; this line is nonsensical as transcribed.
Impact: Medium

---
[Error #10 - Category: Omissions and Truncations]
Location: 31:52 / Speaker: Athena Simpson
Transcript excerpt: "Why want to qualify for SBA?"
Issue: Missing modal/subject

---
[Error #11 - Category: Business Terminology Distortion]
Location: 49:21-49:28 / Speaker: Athena Simpson
Transcript excerpt: "Did he give you evaluation blocks together?"
Issue: Nonsensical phrase in valuation context
Likely intended: "Did he give you a valuation ballpark?" (or similar)
Confidence: Medium
Reasoning: Standard phrasing when probing price expectations; current text is incoherent.
Impact: Low

---
[Error #12 - Category: Homophone/Nonsensical Phrase]
Location: 55:50-56:00 / Speaker: Athena Simpson
Transcript excerpt: "National for two, like in Nash Bot for two."
Issue: Nonsensical; likely referencing Nash’s purchase multiple
Likely intended: "Nash bought for two (x)" (or “Nash bought at 2x”)
Confidence: Medium
Reasoning: Surrounding discussion is about multiples and Nash’s deal terms.
Impact: Low

---
[Error #13 - Category: Business Terminology Distortion]
Location: 5:06-5:12 / Speaker: Luke Gillespie
Transcript excerpt: "I have a call for a med spot tomorrow that will probably be a write up for DL."
Issue: "med spot" in industry context
Likely intended: "med spa"
Confidence: High

Impact: Low

---
[Error #14 - Category: Entity Name (Ambiguous)]
Location: 28:24-28:31 / Speaker: Athena Simpson
Transcript excerpt: "He got all the documents he needed from peanut so he submitted those to Wendy..."
Issue: "peanut" appears to be a misheard proper noun or acronym
Likely intended: Possibly a lender/bank name (e.g., Pinnacle/PNC) or “P&L” (unlikely in this grammatical slot)
Confidence: Low-Medium
Reasoning: “Peanut” is contextually implausible here; sentence refers to obtaining documents from an entity.
Impact: Medium

---
[Error #15 - Category: Omissions and Truncations]
Location: 13:18-13:22 / Speaker: Athena Simpson
Transcript excerpt: "Are you feeling good? She was like, she was big."

Impact: Low

---
[Error #16 - Category: Semantic Inconsistency]
Location: 35:54-36:20 / Speaker: AcquiMatch Team
Transcript excerpt: "This is how much the sellers can inject. This is how much that needs to be covered..."
Issue: “Sellers can inject” conflicts with usual “buyer equity injection” concept
Likely intended: "buyers can inject"
Confidence: Medium
Reasoning: Equity injection normally refers to buyer funds; rest of context supports that.
Impact: Medium

---
[Error #17 - Category: Omissions and Truncations]
Location: 41:29-41:40 / Speaker: AcquiMatch Team
Transcript excerpt: "can you schedule a call with me jump on a call with them that what you guys think and I know this business."
Issue: Missing connectors; sentence structure broken
Likely intended: A request to schedule a vetting call before introducing to the client
Confidence: High
Reasoning: Multiple verbs without connectors indicate ASR dropouts.
Impact: Low-Medium

---
[Error #18 - Category: Omissions and Truncations]
Location: 1:01:00-1:01:06 / Speaker: AcquiMatch Team
Transcript excerpt: "I'll, I'll, I'll, I'll make it work. I'll, I'll start with the two. And I'll stick about a set."
Issue: Closing clause nonsensical
Likely intended: "I'll stick with that" or similar
Confidence: Medium
Reasoning: Repetition and garble suggest ASR confusion at sentence end.
Impact: Low

Removals (Personal/Off-Topic)

---
[REMOVAL #1 - Type: Small Talk/Housekeeping]
Location: 0:12-0:20
Speakers involved: Athena Simpson, AcquiMatch Team
Content excerpt:
"Athena: I'm turning off the thousand videos, what do you guys think of that?
AcquiMatch Team: Yeah, that's great. A little bit less chaotic."
Reasoning:
Meeting setup/housekeeping with no bearing on business content.
Context impact: None—business discussion starts immediately after.
Recommended action: REMOVE 0:12-0:20

---
[REMOVAL #2 - Type: Personal/Off-Topic]
Location: 14:10-15:41
Speakers involved: AcquiMatch Team, Athena Simpson
Content excerpt:
"AcquiMatch Team: I food poisoning a lot when I drank alcohol... I've never had food poisoning since I stopped drinking...
Athena: ...I simply stopped drinking... food poisoning... the most obvious...
AcquiMatch Team: ...there's always lots of traffic...
Athena: Austin is just so weird... it took me double the amount of time... I used to be pretty good about tripling all the times that Google Maps tells me..."
Reasoning:
Personal health/alcohol anecdotes and local traffic inconvenience; no business relevance.
Context impact: Low—conversation returns to client management and deal work immediately after.
Recommended action: REMOVE 14:10-15:41

Borderline Segments (Requires Review)

---
[BORDERLINE #1 - Requires Review]
Location: 13:37-14:10
Content excerpt: "No, you did a good job... sick is the best excuse for I got scared... she said food poisoning at one point..."
Business relevance argument: Offers insight into interpreting client excuses and reinforcing expectations around responsiveness in time-sensitive deals.
Personal content argument: Discusses “food poisoning” as code for hangover; veers into personal judgments.
Recommendation: KEEP with discretion—useful for client management context; subsequent explicit personal anecdotes are already flagged for removal (see Removal #2).

Speaker Attribution and Flow Notes
- Overall speaker roles are consistent (Athena facilitates; team members provide updates; Luke contributes on deals). Some brief single-word interjections (“Right.” “Okay.”) may be misattributed but do not impair understanding—no action recommended.
- Where ASR truncations cause incoherence (Errors #8, #9, #17, #18), reviewers should verify audio to restore intended meaning, especially around financing terms and interest rates.

Patterns to Flag for ASR Improvement
- Seller financing terms: “seller note(s)” frequently misheard as “seller now/knows”
- Financing acronyms: “SBA pre-qual” → “prequel”; “EBITDA” → “e-bitter”; “IBBA” → “IVBA”
- Proper nouns: “Acquiring Minds” → “acquiring mines”; “AcquiMatch” spelling
- Sentence-end truncations and numeric phrases around interest rates (7%) becoming incoherent

Notes on Context Preservation
- The removals are confined to brief housekeeping and personal anecdote tangents. They do not disrupt the logic of the business discussion (client updates, financing strategy, valuation guidance).
- The borderline segment preceding Removal #2 provides useful context on client management; recommend retaining that portion to avoid a jarring transition.
