  I'm turning off the thousand videos, what do you guys think of that?

0:17 - AcquiMatch Team
  Yeah, that's great. A little bit less chaotic.

0:27 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  It's hard because Nash is so chill. It's his action taking and the things he does. He works really hard and he thinks through a lot of things and things that he just thinks are simple.  Like, I have this whole, like when he was going through the loan process, he documented every step, every date, every, you know, so he was able to like share that with me when he was done.  He was like, here's all the time. timings of what happened exactly when and then when I was looking at real estate, he's like, here's a spreadsheet for how you figure out cap rate.  so he's super methodical and thoughtful, but he doesn't do analysis paralysis. Like he actually like takes, like he thinks about things and then he takes action.  He thinks about things he takes action. And it's like, I want to learn something, I'm going to take action.  So like 50 ride-alongs, he's Dave Collinson too, to get leads and like actually went and met like all of those owners.  I was thinking about Justin today, while I was listening to him, was like, Justin knows Nash's story. Justin was in, we started this little club amongst people from CT that Justin was a part of.  So it was like me, Nash, Justin, Renan, even Eli, Aaron, he guys don't know. Like, So, yeah, that was, did you have your college, Justin yet, is that on Friday?  How do you know?

2:07 - AcquiMatch Team
  I think it went pretty well. I think he took it pretty well. He started off pretty combative. Pretty much kind of like, you know, just like saying, well, no, he said that.  And I said that and I just kept explaining, talking through it. And he kind of just kept coming back to that.  And then I just went, it's like, at the end of the day, man, do you want to buy this business or not?  And I was like, and if you want to buy, it's going to change you and your family's lives. This is what I think you need to do.  I told them about being personable and asking them for golf and saying that. And he was like, I did that.  I did that. was like, but you never met him in person. I said, this is his only business for 30 years.  These people are like his family. You never went and visit him. You never met him. and he was like quiet.  And then at the end, was like, I think I see what you're saying. he's like, I said, just own it.  Just call like, don't you don't need to be right. Just call them and be like, I talked to Ryan, I think I could have done some things better.  And, you know, I wanted to see if you're still been, I'd love to meet up with you for lunch or play golf or something.  And he was like, okay, I'll think about it. I said, yeah, think about it. So that's where we're at.

3:33 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Nice work on that. Not easy conversations on either side to have so.

3:41 - AcquiMatch Team
  Yeah. So Kate, we have it's still alive. It's still flickering.

3:45 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  But even still, regardless of what happens there, I just want to, I want to call you out specifically for having tough conversations on both sides, you know, because like, that's something  easy for us to avoid and not do, and it's not an easy thing to do. So well done for being up for the challenge of trying to mediate that and giving former clients hard feedback and hearing hard feedback from, you know, somebody that we were like, No, this is great.  It's going to go amazing. This guy has a great person, you know, it's like being in the middle of that and having to both listen to negative feedback and give negative feedback is not an easy to do.  So thanks for being up for that and doing it.

4:33 - AcquiMatch Team
  Absolutely.

4:35 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  I had a call with Andrew today and he was singing your praises also.

4:39 - AcquiMatch Team
  So good.

4:42 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah. He's like, I tell him all the time. was like, I know, but you know, like I'm still gonna tell him that you told me.  Cool. So okay, we're end of month. How's it going? What would you, I'm not going to go guard the time.

4:59 - AcquiMatch Team
  So what would you It's like to talk through today. Um, Luke, do you want to start?

5:06 - Luke Gillespie
  I got a write up to JB yesterday and I have that private jet brokers. We're talking about it might be a write up next week, but it's not looking like it's going to be this week.
  ACTION ITEM: Attempt to schedule call w/ painting business prospect. Prepare for potential write-up next week.
 - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/241817422?timestamp=312.9999  Um, I have a call for a med spot tomorrow that will probably be a write up for DL. Uh, and I have another really good painting business I'm trying to get on a call.  It might not be tomorrow, but if anything, that's pretty what we have for next week. But yeah, so things are looking great.  I'm feeling good.

5:36 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Well, how are we rounding out on all the clients for the moment?

5:41 - Luke Gillespie
  Good. As we talked on Tuesday, minimums for everyone, um, right, the three that were on pause. And I don't know if I'm going to be able to get one out to Jenny, but I can try tomorrow.  Um, I have, I can write, I can tell you right now how me write up each client has, if you want.  Yeah. Yes. So well, everyone got to accept for Andrew got four and then JJ BH and AA got zero.  So that's. Sorry.

6:16 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Say that one more time. JJ, and BH.

6:20 - Luke Gillespie
  BH. Yes.

6:22 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  OK. Um, what's the latest with those three?
  ACTION ITEM: Schedule call w/ AA to discuss her readiness for buying a business, loan implications. Prepare talking points.
 - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/241817422?timestamp=384.9999

6:28 - Luke Gillespie
  Right.

6:28 - AcquiMatch Team
  Loved. Yeah. Um, so I have a call with AA first thing in the morning tomorrow.

6:34 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  OK.

6:35 - AcquiMatch Team
  So talk about how she's feeling and how things are going. You know, if she's feeling up to buying a business, if this is something she feels like she can do and should probably think about it, right?  Takes some time to think about that. That's going to be challenging. She's going to take on a loan that she's going to owe and, you know, see if she feels up to the challenge.

6:56 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  I'm going to have that conversation with her.

6:58 - AcquiMatch Team
  Uh, she remains pretty. much having three businesses that she's entertaining. So I told Luke, I was like, don't need to push more.  It's not that does nothing for us. She has three businesses, she's interested in, she's we need to move forward on those.

7:13 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So, yeah, opportunities for her.

7:19 - AcquiMatch Team
  That's it for her. Okay. BH, we also got him some opportunities. He's not responding, but he just, it seems like he's kind of just doing the bare minimum.  Like, he'll even comment on things we've talked about already or say things that you know, I've already addressed. And then the most recent is like, I can't afford this.  So I sent him a message being saying, Hey, what you said, it's trying to get an idea of how much do you have?  syllable, right? And I said, last time we talked, you said 100,000. You know, what is it? What is that number now?  Like, we can update your deal box and right for you. And I told him that when we spoke last time, I said, if that changes, you let me know, we'll adjust your search to something that you can afford.
  ACTION ITEM: Set up call w/ BH to address communication issues, refine search criteria, discuss affordability concerns.
 - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/241817422?timestamp=497.9999  He said, Okay. But again, he could just say that, Hey, Ryan, I think we need to adjust down. So it's just communication with him is a bit, a bit difficult.  But when he responds to the next message, I'm going to get him on another call to talk. Kind of say, Hey, you know, you're a couple of months into this.  And I gotta say that we've talked a few times and Brian, I don't want to keep saying the same things.  But, you know, if you're not responsive, we can't make progress on these deals. We can't get you what you need.  If you're not playing by the same kind of playbook as me. So I do plan to reel him in.  I've done that already in my last call and he committed, he just hasn't stayed by it and he bought a business, right?  So I'm gonna stay, you know, I'm conscious of that, right? So my plan is to get have another call with him to see if I can refine what he's looking for or explain what he can afford and talk him through that and then get him back in in terms of being responsive.

9:30 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  I think he wants to buy anything, you know, like, we'll talk about it tomorrow, but like, like, I told you, there's a couple, I think we need to like, so it's like, can you really do this, you know, because there is new business you're gonna buy where you can just disappear for weeks on end, like, it's just not gonna happen, you know, we don't want to put you in a situation that could bankrupt you, knowing that you're gonna have this reality with him.  I mean, he tried to back out from day one, they're oops, I don't have any money. I'm just like, okay, I think he just keeps bobbing and weaving around like, I don't know.  Like, I think he's just changed his mind or doesn't want to put in the work or whatever. So, well, let's talk about him tomorrow.  Cool. And then JJ. Yeah.

10:26 - AcquiMatch Team
  JJ had a call with her today. That was really well. She was on vacation last week with her family before that.  was sick. So, she was saying that's the reasons I haven't been around. You know, she got an SBA prequel.  So, I just kind of talked her up on them like, hey, nice job. Was this bad? She thought and she was kind of laughing.  She was like, no, you know, and she was like, you know, we talked about the power. She business she's looking at, she says, like, I'm kind of feeling like it's a little bit small, and I do like essential businesses.  And so we talked through that, I think it's okay, I told her to message the program so that she's not interested, so she gave enough feedback.  And I'm happy that she dug as hard as she did into that one. She, she, she didn't like turn it off immediately.  the business is half power washing, half putting up Christmas lights. And it's by like a, I think it's like a, like a very young kid.  I think the kid owns it's like young 20s, right? not necessarily what she first said in her onboarding of what she wanted to acquire, right?  was more the roofing business. So, so she said, God, think that's going to be the one. I'm like, okay, I got that, like we can, we can not do that.  And I said, you know, I told her we had put it on pause because she, her, her search on pause because we didn't have that.  She was understanding of that. She's like, okay, are we back on? We're back on. We're pulling stuff for you.  We can probably get you something next week. Said that to buy you some time, Luke. I know you're you're close to one with her, but you know, we're okay for next.
  ACTION ITEM: Message JJ re importance of communication during vacation/illness periods due to time-sensitive nature of deals.
 - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/241817422?timestamp=728.9999  She was happy to hear maybe something will be there next week. Yeah. So she seems good.

12:18 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay. Can we tell her like if you're going to be gone or on vacation or not responsive for a period of time or sick, please let us know because some of these things are so time sensitive.  know, like if like tell her, watch back the call from Nash. Like he literally had an offer in hand on the day that he went and saw the business, right?  Like these are and it's even more competitive now. Can Nash did this a year and a half ago before the whole of the universe found out about business buying?  So just like reiterate that to her. Like it's okay if you're going to go on vacation, but you need to let us know so that we can either not put things in front of you that are going to be gone by the time you get back and.  or like just no, I think it was about the SBA thing. So.

13:09 - AcquiMatch Team
  I agree with you. just didn't. I didn't want to challenge her because I really I tried to gauge how hard are you ready to do this?

13:18 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Are you feeling good? She was like, she was big.

13:20 - AcquiMatch Team
  She gave me a lot of good energy and I didn't want to kill that. So I was like, okay, this is what we're going to do.  But I should have, I should have, I meant to say that, okay, in the future, just get back to me, try to stay communicating with us.  It's important. I think she would have been fine, but I got, I forgot that.

13:37 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  No, you did a good job because we know, we know that what she was saying and it's like sick is the best excuse for I got scared.  I wasn't doing something like anybody can say like, they're sick or I had to tell all go was like, you know, she was, she said food poisoning at one point.  I was like, don't do that. That's like code for I have a hangover and I don't drink alcohol. So like, don't tell anyone I have.  food poisoning because like, I don't ever get food poisoning. It's like, oh, yeah, we got last night at a restaurant and had some weird tacos.  Like, were there margaritas at that restaurant?

14:10 - AcquiMatch Team
  I food poisoning a lot when I drank alcohol. I'm like, no, I've never had food poisoning since I stopped drinking alcohol six years ago.

14:21 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Um, I mean, I know, like, I don't know if people realize how obvious that excuse is, but I, I simply stopped drinking.  I was just like, Oh my God. Yeah, food poisoning. Like it's like the most obvious, you know, it just came on and out of nowhere.

14:41 - AcquiMatch Team
  Okay. So my, my, one of my former bosses, uh, when, when people be late to work, they would always go, ah, there's lots of traffic and you go, and he always go, I know, like he would say, um, there's always lots of traffic.  When I'm late to or something like that, it's, it's the most common thing.

15:00 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So yeah, that is true. I will completely own the fact that I've used that. Austin is just so weird.  Like last night was the last night I had an appointment downtown and it took me double the amount of time it normally takes me to get there.  You know, so I used to be pretty good about tripling all the times that Google Maps tells me just to give me like lots of time.  I've gotten less better about that. But yeah, so anyways, like when people say they're sick now we're seeing this with like Alex and Jenny and it's like we know there's something else going on there and like it's it's harder for people to be like I am scared and I don't know what to do and I'm questioning whether I can do this as opposed to like I got sick, you know.  Most of time your phone works when you're sick. Can you send a message like I'm sick. Anyways, so. The, the.  Eternal dance of managing clients and all of the things that go on and the emotions that go on and we will get even more exposure to this is be continue to go through.  Anyways, good work on that, Ryan.

16:31 - AcquiMatch Team
  Thank you.

16:34 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  You're very good with science, like I wish. think you record all the calls, but you know, as we. All get more exposure to it, like the way way you handle them is very good, you know, I was telling.  Somebody on a sales call the other day. was like, Ryan will like hold you accountable. He'd be like, okay, so you're going to do the financial modeling within a day and then we're getting on a call.  And I was like, this person was like, I'm not. They didn't sign on, of course. They wanted to speak to clients or something.  So how many closes have you had? was like, you were going to be the reason why it doesn't close.  Not us. Like, I actually have started saying that to people. like, it will not have anything to do with us.  It's not the bad business. It's you. You were going to be the reason why I won't close. won't say it that directly, but essentially I'm like, it's, you know, you're going to change your mind.  You're going to get scared. You're going to do things. You're not going to meet the owner. You're going to ghost them when they send back right up.  So like, you're going to do a million things. You're going to let your L Y lapse because you're focused on your W two, like, it has nothing to do with us.  Are you going to close? Are you going to do everything you need to do? Like, I need to get better about that.  Dave Collins, then he's like, I basically convinced people, like, he's like, if I get on a sales call, I basically spend the whole call convincing him not to do this.  And if they still are emphatic that they want to do it, then then I'll take them off. as a client?

18:02 - AcquiMatch Team
  Yeah. And that's why that's why I think the last two calls have been really good with Renan and Nash because you can see they did a lot of work, right?  And so that just reminds everybody on the call of it. Okay, this is not just like super simple. You've got to push that extra effort.  Like look what these guys are putting in. And I thought it was cool. Nash saying, he's like, oh, I'm making significantly more.  That was that was great to hear, you know, for everybody, I think.

18:36 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  I think he he cleared like a million himself in year one.

18:42 - AcquiMatch Team
  For 1.9 x. That's crazy. That's great.

18:49 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  But I mean, he yeah, I think he was on three 400 for his W two.

18:52 - AcquiMatch Team
  yeah, he like nearly three x w two. That's awesome. Good for him.

18:59 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, but he's He's working. I'm going to be a plumber. I'm going to go do 15 ride-alongs. I'm going to do all that research on the owner so that I can position myself to win.  There's a lot of things that these guys just casually pass over. It's a lot of work. It's a lot of strategy that you know it's this is not just a transaction.  It's not you go into a store and pick something out and buy it. So I'm excited that they've been coming.  Nash was lot busy. He won't even go on acquiring mines. I tried get him on there and he won't do it because he doesn't like because the guy was so concerned about like the neighborhood and stuff that he's not able to like publicly announce his acquisition and stuff.

19:58 - AcquiMatch Team
  So That story will never, or at least not anytime soon. I'm, yeah, all right. I'll push clients to go back and listen to that one because there's a lot of good stuff in there.  There wasn't that many people on the call today. Now kind of, I'll kind of highlight its exclusivity.

20:20 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, like he turned on acquiring minds, like he wouldn't even go on acquiring minds. So this is something you're not going to hear anywhere else.  Literally.

20:28 - AcquiMatch Team
  That good for Jason because me and Jason have a call yesterday and we came with a strategy. He's going to go buy Pakistani desserts and bring it to the street.

20:45 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Nice. That's how you know you're going to play the win. Like you can like someone and still do the thing.  It's like courting. Right? Like, you show that you're putting in effort and showing up with the flowers and taking them to nice dinners and, you know, giving them a preview of what it's going to be like to be with you.  So, like, it's not a bad strategy, but like, it's, it's something that other people are doing and they're not taking the time to do that.

21:18 - AcquiMatch Team
  It was the perfect time for him to tell that story because so.

21:23 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Was Jason on the call?

21:24 - AcquiMatch Team
  No, he wasn't on today.

21:25 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay.

21:27 - AcquiMatch Team
  But as I said, I'm going to tell Jason to listen to that one. But yeah, so me, what happened, I used this like, so when I was working at a rental car company, this woman, she would just drive by.  She would come into the office and she would just bring me like a cake or like something that she made from the house.  No thing. She would just give it to her. Ryan and she, I got you this. That would be it.  And then sometime in the next week to two, she would make a reservation at my store and she would have some specific.  specific request of what she wanted. And I would just do it for her because like she gave me this cake, no question, nothing.  And then she asked me a favor. She went to Mandit. She was like, can you do this for me?  And I would just do it. Cause I was like, she made me a cake. You know, she baked me something, you know?  And, um, so then I always like, I used to smile when I used to make a reservation. Cause I was like, man, then she is good with that.  Like she really's got me, you know, like, so one time I was, when I was doing my e-commerce business, it was around COVID was, around COVID was happening and there was like a scramble for, to get my manufacturer was in China.  And I was trying to get, I was trying to make a shipment. So like you have, there's boats, they fill up with enough merchandise.  So you want to get on that boat. So you have to, you have to coordinate with your manufacturer to get your products completed in time so that they can make it in time.  the deadline to get on that boat. And so it was like, things were getting crazy. And I was like, I need, I, you know, I need to get on that boat.  And I would call my supplier and my rep, her name was Cheney. I would just like, Hey, Cheney, can you get it done by such and such date?  And she was like, I don't know where we have a lot of requests, we have this and this, you know, I was like, I need this.  I was like, I really need you to get on to do this for me. So I'll see what I can do, Ryan.  I'll try, right? And so after I just, I looked up, I remember this lady used to be in these cakes, I looked up online, a flower chocolate delivery.  And I had a Chinese company deliver chocolates and flowers to her. And I got on that boat.

23:51 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  got that  out.

23:53 - AcquiMatch Team
  And that caused like a hundred bucks. I probably saved thousands of dollars with that. So, you know, Um, I was just thinking about that and I was just like, we need to do more stuff like that, encourage our clients to be more personal to, to take that extra step.  And then when he said that today, I mean, golf balls, he said he got him on sale, right? It was pretty.

24:16 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Hey, we're the ones on sale. So those are the ones I got and it's his favorite golf balls, you know, but even doing the research, like look up their name, look up their business, see if you can find some things out about them before you meet them, know, and like show up with a, I mean, I told you like the alien things and then the map, you know, the travel map that they're going to do with their kids.  And so, I mean, that travel map cost me 40, 50 bucks. I had an Amazon primed. It was literally like just doing some online shopping and having it delivered.  I had no business being in that deal, like none, like the, I don't, you know, the fact that I was like the only person that they actually let meet the owner in person and that they like seriously considered my offer.  I didn't know what I was doing. Genuinely. I mean, I knew more than most first-timers, but I still was the first-timer trying to take down an $8 million deal.  They're like, you need to start out hunting before. And I was like, don't we do that after? Oh, my gosh.  But the broker, I was his therapist because I would just call the broker and let him just vent, you know?  And I was just like, oh my God, this is so like, because he owned like 10 mail shops and stuff and he would just vent to me all the time.  So he liked me because I was like his little therapist at the end of the night and he just got to tell me about all the things that went wrong with his businesses and all the other buyers that were .  And then the owners liked me because I actually cared about who they were and what they wanted to do and turned up the travel map after I asked them what they wanted to do.  Oh, you know, and they deliberated over my deal for an entire weekend when it was two million less than the other people were bringing in.

26:10 - AcquiMatch Team
  I'm thinking like, yeah, like, this is good points. Like, I'm wondering, like, if we should add at the end of our broker calls, like, hey, is there anything we can do to stand out to the buyer, to seller, right?  mean, add one of those little things. I mean, we can include that in our write-up, you know, just to give him something to start from, you know?  Anything about that idea, like, it will help us, like, help our, our buyers stand out and connect. What do you think, Luke?

26:48 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah, I'm writing it down. I'm gonna ask him, like, is Yeah, be like, yeah, okay, I appreciate you.

27:00 - AcquiMatch Team
  going through all that. And like, one of the things that like is important, we know, and we try to, you know, relate to the buyer and working with his like relationships.  Is there anything important here about like our buyers should know about establishing relationship connecting with them? And just see like, like the thing was to say, she spoke with that broker all the time, maybe that helps like build relationship with the broker as well.  Oh, good. You're like, actually trying to like connect here. No.

27:33 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah.

27:36 - AcquiMatch Team
  Let's let's try it out on the media. We'll talk.

27:38 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  We'll see how that goes.

27:41 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah. Yeah, I wrote it down.

27:44 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay, cool. How about our active deals? Gil, JB, how are they any updates since Tuesday since we last talked?

27:53 - AcquiMatch Team
  Gil has a broker called tomorrow. JB is still waiting to hear back on his submitted. He got confirmation received and he said that they do have other parties interested and they will get back to him but he made a good offer and Great Yeah, and he said, you know, he already met them twice And he said that he feels they like them so We feel good about it What's he doing with the other one in the meantime?

28:36 - AcquiMatch Team

29:00 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  It's a shame. I don't know if for you guys, but he was so quiet. I was like, what are you saying?  But he like kind of lit up a little bit and talked through all the things that he found all that deal.  Well, he wants to get in the mix.

29:12 - AcquiMatch Team
  He wants to be on there sharing that stuff. So we got to get him active in a deal and then, you know, highlight him a little bit on those calls, get his confidence up.

29:23 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, that was good. mean, I had to catch up with him today, but where we at with him.

29:31 - AcquiMatch Team
  So he likes this business. It's not going to be SBA. And so he was like, do you know anybody that can help with lending on online businesses or online businesses?  And I said, I'm not sure I'm on the seller side. I didn't usually work with like the financing piece.  But I can ask. He said, okay, will you do that for me? So right off the the call, I messaged a group chat that I'm in with some friends that are in all of them are pretty much still in online.  And someone messaged me and said, Hey, I'm doing a call tonight, I'm looking for an online business. He's like, Do you want to join the call?  That's how to do it. So I jumped on the call. And I met someone who's there, said that they think they can lend on it.  So I was planning on discussing that with you before I discuss it. I need to see if I could get some options going.  then if I did, all right, let me talk to Athena and see what she thinks about this. And then we'll go from there.  So happy to talk about that.

30:38 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, I think also when it comes to like financing strategies, stuff like that, rather than saying like, I don't know, let's have a chat too, in case like I have some resources I haven't shared yet.  Also, just because we haven't gotten to that point on any of the deals I haven't like, there's a whole world of independent sponsor, private capital,  et cetera. But great work on finding some resources. how big is the deal?

31:10 - AcquiMatch Team
  It's 750k. Andrew said he can inject 250, so he wants 500.

31:17 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  And why are we not exploring a seller now on this one? If it's not financeable by SBA.

31:30 - AcquiMatch Team
  Do you remember Luke? there's anything particular about him saying what kind of note you was open to?

31:36 - Luke Gillespie
  Right. The broker said 10 to 20% seller knows it should be reasonable. You know, the standard broker answer, like, don't try to ask for 70% seller financing, but yeah, he'll give the standard.

31:52 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Why want to qualify for SBA?

31:55 - Luke Gillespie
  The guy renounces US citizenship. Sorry.

32:00 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  The owner he renounced his U.S.

32:02 - Luke Gillespie
  so he's not a citizen So the business isn't based in the U.S. It is it's in Florida, but the owner is not a U.S.

32:11 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  citizen So what does that have to do with this be it?

32:14 - Luke Gillespie
  I the broker says it doesn't qualify and I looked it up as well It that's what I found a the ownership has to be 51% owned by a U.S.

32:23 - AcquiMatch Team
  citizen Yeah Yeah, I think you're No, the seller so I think that's primarily because Fylender if they're if the seller of the buyer that they're Lending to needs to pursue a lawsuit of any form The fact that he's not doesn't have to buy by U.S.  and regulations makes it more difficult for them to get their money and so it's a risk With Wendy I Get messaging because

33:00 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  It's like, I know, I know, I know there's been workarounds for like foreign owned entities before, like particularly Canada.  So I'm just like, are we taking this as gospel because that's what the broker said or one of our lenders actually, like let's verify those things when, when brokers tell us that stuff because if it's, if it's a US entity, but I take your point on the lawsuit, I just, I want it verified by someone we trust rather than to the broker.

33:34 - AcquiMatch Team
  Oh, this is what you.

33:37 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  But so is it competitive or are other people trying to buy this business?

33:45 - Luke Gillespie
  Um, yeah.

33:49 - AcquiMatch Team
  I don't imagine till it looks like a good business. I don't remember exactly what the competitiveness was unless you remember.

33:56 - Luke Gillespie
  From the call, the broker was just like, he didn't have any concrete offers, but you You know, he got a lot of inquiries and it was broker talk.  said, I feel like, yeah, it'll probably get an offer in the next couple of weeks.

34:07 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  What what broker?

34:09 - Luke Gillespie
  It's quite like, uh, okay. Wayland was his name.

34:15 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Dude, when when this comes up, when it's like, it's not eligible for SB financing.

34:21 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah.

34:22 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  I think we needed to ask the broker his opinion.

34:26 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah.

34:27 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Like, how do you think this is going to get financed?

34:32 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah, it's a good question.

34:34 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  You know, because it's like, okay, it's not eligible for SBA. So you, you see more of these than I do, you know, like whatever, you know, like most of our clients are utilizing SBA financing.  This is kind of a smaller one. Like, how do you think that this deal is going to get financed?  Who do you think is going to buy it or how do you think they're going to do it? You know, what do you think is a way around this?  Like, I almost get them to problem solve with you. But like when it's not competitive. And it's this small, I'm like, seller finance, you know, is like, that's the way to overcome the fact he's renounced citizenship, like he's not going to get paid unless certain, unless the business is in a good place or whatever.  So that would always be my first port of call is like, do we just need to drag this relationship out?  So the seller sees it the only way that they're going to be able to do this is seller finance.  This is, you know, online businesses are a little bit more difficult, but if it was a brick and mortar business, and it's not eligible for SBA, then really the only way is for them to seller finance.  If nobody else is going to buy it, that's the first one. Now this lender that you talk to Ryan, tell me more about them.
  ACTION ITEM: Follow up w/ Community Capital re Andrew's deal. Get specifics on terms, rates, experience w/ similar deals. Record findings.

35:54 - AcquiMatch Team
  So, they're called community capital, he was just saying they have a just a network. So actually I submitted on this website called Sora where they kind of just put out here's the opportunity more or less.  This is the deal. This is how much the sellers can inject. This is how much that needs to be covered and they just wait to see who's interested.  So I guess that's what they did and then they got this response from community capital and they set up a call between a three-way call between the three of us.  And then I just explained what Accuimatch does. We primarily look to utilize SBA, but I can foresee in the future there's going to be we're going to need alternative resources for financing depending on some things.  There's some other things come up too that I'm going to want to tell you about. But you know I was just like we're looking for someone that we can work with that depending on what comes up if it's not going to  And for SBA, we can get reasonable funding for it. And he was like, yeah, because we could definitely do that.  I think the market you guys are working in is interesting. And he's like, you know, if you can, we've done, this particular deal is an Amazon business.  He's like, we've done Amazon deals in the past, so we're actually already familiar. And so, yeah, we just talked about that.  he's like, yeah, if you can submit to me the financials and the SIM, I'll get back to you and let you know what we think on it.  So, all right.

37:35 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Are there a broker or lender?

37:38 - AcquiMatch Team
  There are a lender.

37:41 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay, so community capital is like its own bank. They're not gonna go and shop it around to banks.

37:49 - AcquiMatch Team
  I don't believe so. I took it as they were the lender.

37:55 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  I'm also be curious on like, if they could give you a roundabout idea of like terms. that they would do in these scenarios before we make an introduction?

38:09 - AcquiMatch Team
  Okay, I can't remember if you mentioned exactly what terms, but I did record the call so I can go back and listen to it.

38:20 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay, yeah, because if they're like, it'll be 30% over three years, you know what I mean? Like the terms really matter in terms of like what they would lend on.  And we want to kind of like be like, I know you can't give exact, but like based on the scenario, can you give me a range or what are your typical terms look like.  So with commercial loans or non SBA backed loans, typically terms are going to be much worse, higher interest rate, shorter, and they're going to ask for more of a down payment.  So like just getting a sense of what that looks like so we could like is this deal even going to be able to  work, right, under those circumstances is what I'd typically like to do there, um, and then just getting an idea of like other deals that they've done, like that, you know, how well-known are they, whatever.  I really don't like putting people capital providers in front of people unless we vetted them first, not just like an option, like actually vetting, what do they do, how do they lend, what's their process, like every SBA lender that I put in front of people, like I get on the phone and ask them like, what's your process, what's your terms, like how do you work with people, have you done this before, more about your experience, etc.  um, especially for something like this, it could be like sometimes you can get in pretty predatory situations with the the terms and the rates, that sort of thing, because it's not SBA backed and or somebody who like really needs the money, not saying these guys.  They're like that, but I'm saying for the benefit of the group and learning in terms like there's all different sorts of people that can provide money.  But the costs can be completely different. So on the larger end of deals, though, I do have private capital providers.  And or we could talk to Andrew about raising money himself and getting like friends and family to go in on the deals and structuring it that way.

40:32 - AcquiMatch Team
  Okay.

40:33 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Have you talked to him about that? if he would want to do that, or does he want alone? He doesn't think he'd be able to raise.

40:41 - AcquiMatch Team
  I did. I just always lead. Like I was mainly just trying to be like. Just go in his direction.  So you're like, Hey, I think I would want to do this, but I need some money. Do you know anyone who do this?  And I was like, I can do, I can try to find that out for you. And I was, my plan was to talk with them, submit them.  and the Sim and the P and L and then say, can you schedule a call with me jump on a call with them that what you guys think and I know this business.  So they're not going to know more than me. So I'm going listen to what they say about it. Where I would be the two of you guys think.  And if I vetted them and had that call with them and I feel good about them. I'm like, okay, let me talk to my buyer and see if we can talk further and I was going to run that by you.
  ACTION ITEM: Review Community Capital info w/ Athena before sharing w/ Andrew. Discuss financing options, incl. seller financing, investor options.
 - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/241817422?timestamp=2478.9999

41:29 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay. Sometimes we just need to like, yes, we can follow their lead, but we should be leading the conversation with them and getting them to think about the other tools and their toolkit too.  So, you know, he might not realize like, oh, I could structure, I could raise money from other people and structure it that way or I could push back on seller financing.  you know, so I think in those instances, we want to have a discussion about like, here's all the options available to you.  how do you feel about each of those? And then we can try to direct based on that. So first protocol when it's not SBA financial is seller financing, keeping it all between the two of them.  Then it's like if there are alternative financing options in terms of lending, then what are the terms look like?  Because if it's 15, 20% interest, for example, that that's a pretty expensive capital and then this one's already small enough.  So like what would the return be there? Alternatively, bringing in investors and setting up like a pref and or investors and just giving them a return on interest.  So I know like there's angels that'll invest as lenders, you know, they'll do it as a loan with a nice interest rate versus equity upside.  So yeah, do a little due diligence on these guys, maybe before sharing everything and just be like, Hey, can you give me an idea of like the terms that you might look at and or just doing some research on them and like how they went on more deals like this, like what's their experience level in this.  And then, um, then we can talk about it before you send it over to Andrew.

43:38 - AcquiMatch Team
  I mean, do you think it's I mean, I told them the time is this is the time we deal.  And so I said, I'll get you guys what you need.

43:48 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  want to hear I need to hear back soon. They're like, okay.

43:52 - AcquiMatch Team
  So I said I've got a whole thing a bit more. My plan was just to submit them. The P and L and the Sim, I can do that literally right now and  then they said they can get back to me quickly and then I can do a call if you guys offer and I can just hear them out and then maybe discuss it.

44:09 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay we wouldn't normally do that though with lenders like we wouldn't do that for a client like submit the P&Ls and the financials to a lender on behalf of a client.

44:23 - AcquiMatch Team
  Okay.

44:25 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So you know there's there's just a making sure we're not putting ourselves in an advisory position that could invite liability.  So just overall we need to be careful about how involved we're getting on on these aspects of it. Because it's it's pretty clear in our agreement, like we're not going to talk directly to lenders on your deals.  Um, in this case, I think it's okay, because there's timeliness and you've already like engaged the relationship, but they're pretty clear that you're not the decision maker and that there's still another party, right?

45:21 - AcquiMatch Team
  That's right.

45:22 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay, well, yeah, let's see what they say then, and then just find out some more about them, please. Before we make an introduction, and then let's review it before we send it over to Andrew, and then, like, when the financing conversations come up, let's discuss before, like, we say, like, don't know something or whatever, because this is whole repository of information that I have that I haven't necessarily bestowed on you all because it just hasn't come up yet, so I just don't want clients to think, like, it's part of what I sell to them is that we do.  structuring and finance and options and that sort of thing. So we just don't ever want to say like, I don't know before we've had a conversation to make sure I can fill in any knowledge gaps that we might have as a team too.  So, but I mean, it's good to be proactive, which is also need to be just careful on how much we get involved in deals and be brokering and that sort of thing, because it just can invite some liability on us.  If they're like, I didn't know what I was signing or, you know, they went and got the loan terms and that sort of thing.  So that's why I always like make the introductions, the lenders, let them do all the conversations and stuff. So it removes us from that liability piece there.  But this is a timely thing. So once you get those options back, then we can talk about like you could do potentially like two offers, if he's going to give them all cash at close and it'll be significantly.  less than if we were to do seller financing because I imagine the this capital probably come at a price.  I don't think it'll be SBA rates. I bet it would be, you know, 15% maybe higher. Did they tell you interest rates at all?

47:17 - AcquiMatch Team
  He gave me a range. And so...

47:21 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Was it outside of like what we normally see for SBA?

47:24 - AcquiMatch Team
  Help me be 7% and I'm, I mean, I'm not good. No, I'm saying they could tell me that I'm not going to believe anything until I see what they can do.  I said, yeah, multiple deals like we could do in the future. And they were like, oh, we can do this.  And this is like, all right, let's start with this one. I want to see what you guys can do on this one.  I'll submit you guys what you need and then get back to me. So let's start with one. Okay. yeah.

47:50 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay, cool. Awesome. let me know what they come back with.

47:55 - AcquiMatch Team
  Sweet.

47:57 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Um, on the Andrew front. And he knows we're trying hard, but he's definitely disillusioned with deal flow. So, any more thoughts in terms of what we're doing there for him?

48:16 - AcquiMatch Team
  I have an off-market scheduled on Monday for a mortgage business, real estate adjacent. Online business, probably going to be around like four or five million dollars.  That's doing about a million and e-bitter. I think that could be a potential off-market right up for him.

48:50 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Oh, cool. It's off-market too.

48:54 - AcquiMatch Team
  Yeah, this is the coaching business that you prefer.

48:59 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Oh, okay. So, why would it be five million? You said it would be four or five million. He's got a million and even up.

49:09 - AcquiMatch Team
  Yeah, it's a subscription business. So, you may try to push that.

49:21 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Did he give you evaluation blocks together?

49:25 - AcquiMatch Team
  I asked him, I said, I said, what do you want? What number do you want? would make you happy?  He said, I don't know. I kind of want to see you for you, which was the smart answer. He's a smart guy.  So, he's going to know very well about subscription models and what they go for. And I'm guessing he's going to try to push it.  I'm guessing.

49:46 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  See the face of the business?

49:48 - AcquiMatch Team
  He is. He's the face of the business. I watched the videos he does. I feel like it could be replicated.  I don't, I don't, it didn't look anything to me like it couldn't be someone else.

50:01 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Got it. That's going to bring his value down, though, so regardless of what he thinks of subscriptions, if he's the face of it.  Clint Fiore, you all should follow him on social media if you're not already. He's actually one of the best brokers, I think, out there, and he's very vocal about how he does things.  he said the other day that I was thinking about, was like, we should probably change that. And he seemed like I never asked a seller what they want for their business.  He's like, because they don't know how this is done and how it's valued. He's like, I never asked them what they want.  I tell them what it's worth. I'm like, that's interesting, you know, so we're not supposed to give an exact price because we want our clients to do that.  But it's something for us to think about noodle on is like, if we're just asking them what they want, knowing that they don't know how valuations work or anything.  Are we setting a precedent that they're going to get what they want or more than it's worth?

51:03 - AcquiMatch Team
  I'll say I disagree with what he said. I, I've asked that question over hundred times and it works. Everyone's different, but many works.

51:13 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So what, what about when somebody wants like 10x, what do you do then?

51:17 - AcquiMatch Team
  Yeah, I just, I just say, how did you come up with that valuation? And then they don't have an answer.  And then I kind of bring them into what a realistic valuation is. But I don't want to go too much further without kind of bringing them to that level of day.  If they say it on the first call, then it's like, well, we can have a call. What I had to call the landscaping guy and he wanted, he wanted something ridiculous.  I was like, yo, landscape business. That's, I was like, that's, that's what I want. That's what's going to make me happy.  I was like, well, realistically our buyers are going be using an SBA loan. So it's going to be, you know, between three to four X could be higher, you know, depending on the buyer.  And he was like, he said a number, was like, it's way, it was way above that. was just like, all right, well, are you saying three or are we saying two, though, two to four?  I'll say two to four. If I think the business is super legit, I usually won't say two because I've said two before and people go two.  And the reality is, I know that business should go for more than two X and I don't want to make come off like a, I'm trying to undercut their business.  Like, if I'm saying two and they have a really amazing business, then I feel like they lose confidence in me.  So if it's, if it's pretty good, I'll say three to four. If it's, if it's like, okay, I'll say, I'll say two to four.  That's what I've been doing.

52:51 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  I would always say two to four. Just because like, what about Nash's situation? That was a super solid business that should have traded.  the four or higher. So like are we setting expectations too high by saying three, right? even though you know it's a good business, like that's like how are we positioning it?  like it doesn't say them. It's just like so business is you know your type of business at your size depending on some factors that will explore a little bit later would be between two to four.  Just so that it anchors them lower right that if it comes in it like you know what if we get in there and there's like all the family work there and you know there's all sorts of things that when we get under the hood we didn't discover early on and we were the ones that set the anchor of the price initially that could cause issues down the line.  I like to disappoint people little whatever it is. questions are and how we find out details and stuff, it'll be between, you know, two and four.

54:09 - AcquiMatch Team
  One guy threw that back in my face and I was like, not going to do that again. He was like, because we say on the email, like, hey, we give you some type of valuation, like, give you an idea of a range.  And this guy was like, two, and in my head, I was, I really knew he wasn't going to go to, but I said two to four to keep it broad so I could, for our buyers, he's like, two, he's like, if you think it's going to be two, I'm not going to waste my time.  I was like, it's a range. Right now we had a brief call. You know, I don't know everything about your business.  You could definitely be higher than that. I'm saying around two to four. And he was like, look, I don't, if it's, you're saying maybe two, like, telling you, I don't want anything like that.  I don't have to sell my business. I'm doing this because I wanted to get realistic valuation of gotten evaluations a lot.  higher than that. And I was like, okay, I was like, what would you, what was the valuation, what would you like to sell for?  And he was like, he was like mad at me that I said the two. And in my head, I knew two was below for him.  And so I like, okay, from now on, if I think it's good, I'm saying three to four, if I think it's so, so I'll say two to four.  So anyways, that was my experience. So obviously, we could maybe lose another guy like that if I always say two to four.  So I try to use this strategically. But I see what you're saying.

55:32 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  But even if it's a good business, and they don't know how it's valued, they might think two is great.

55:50 - AcquiMatch Team
  I guess.

55:52 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  National for two, like in Nash Bot for two.

55:55 - AcquiMatch Team
  That's the first deal. How many deals have you charged yourself or two?

56:00 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Off-market, you can anchor them lower, right? if they haven't talked into a broker, there's not a competitive situation.

56:11 - AcquiMatch Team
  Maybe.

56:13 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  But go look at this by sell and see what the multiples are. It is too for a lot of these smaller businesses.  So you're not giving them incorrect information, but we are sending the bar pretty high by telling him three to four just because one guy got mad at you.

56:30 - AcquiMatch Team
  Well, I mean, I do think three is that's real. That's not, I'm not raising the bar. think three is a majority of the businesses that you see online are between three and four.

56:43 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  The report, the broker reports are lower. Like, if you look at the IVBA quarterly report, it depends on the size of the business.  It depends on the risk. It depends on seasonality. It depends on so many things. So, I guess what I'm saying is that I would wrap up.

57:00 - AcquiMatch Team
  other us give a broader range that gives our clients more opportunity to work within that range if they get under the hood and it's like well  there's all this customer concentration so we can only give you two but we could do a performance note at a three or something like that right like you're anchoring really high at a three I see what you're saying I also say I also think like it's not necessarily that they're gonna throw it in my face it's that well I'm gonna lose them right and like they don't have to show up on that second call and some of them don't if I think it's a good business I'm like I want this to be a write-up and like I don't want to undercut it to think he's like man I'm not gonna do two or stop thinking about it so I really honestly think it's gonna be somewhere between three and four I say that he gets on the next call I do the write-up and then if our buyer wants to go a little bit lower he can not really setting him up well in that regard though so think about how to position it

58:00 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Right? And you can make it not about the business and make it about the market and just be like for automotive businesses of your size, they trade between two and four.  Sounds like you've got a pretty solid business. once we get under the hood, I imagine it would be on the higher range, but I'm just telling you what we see in the market.  Right? so remove it from them personally and just so that they're anchored at a lower point just in case we get under there.  And like we've now affected the buyer's ability to negotiate because we've told them three to four when actually maybe it should be more like a 2.5.

58:41 - AcquiMatch Team
  Okay.

58:43 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  But I think there's ways you can position it. hear you don't want to lose them. But genuinely, if they're just getting on a call to get evaluated, they're probably not going to sell anyway.  And it's going to be a lot harder. So, you know, and we can position it as in our professional opinion of what we see.  of lots of deals and this is, you know, reported data. So I don't have enough information to go super deep with you.  But what I can tell you is that businesses of your size in your industry sell for between two to four.

59:17 - AcquiMatch Team
  Okay.

  And then once we get a little bit deeper with you, when you're comfortable, we'll sign the NDAs, we'll be able to ask some more questions, dive into your financials, we'll be able to give you a more accurate idea of what that looks like.  But I'm just managing your expectations based on what we're seeing out there in the market. But if like, a lot of them are just reverse tire kicking, right?  They're just getting on a call as I know what they think their business is worth, they have no intention of selling.

59:50 - AcquiMatch Team
  Yeah, but I, you know, I got, we're trying to push off market. I'm trying, I'm selling them. I'm trying to convince them to work with us.  Get me the next call. I'll get it to a write up, you know? If I, I got you.

1:00:01 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Hopefully we'll get more volume of leads so we don't have to be so like grasping on to like every single one.  It's like if they're not willing to take our expertise in our advice and in terms of like ranges and stuff, they're probably going to be difficult throughout the whole process.  But we have so little of those leads right now. Hopefully David can help us with that, getting some more leads and I'm working on a deal with Dave Collins and Siyoga access to his list pretty soon.  It's going to be very expensive for us to pass those leads on to clients if they close but it's another channel and then when we get this other stuff too.  So you have more experience than any of us in talking to owners. if you try it a few times and you're like Athena, is costing us deals and I will totally listen to you in that regard.  But I just know down the line when it comes to negotiation and if it's something that they actually want to close on, if we've anchored it so high gives our clients very little wiggle room to be

1:01:00 - AcquiMatch Team
  then negotiate on that. Okay. I'll, I'll, I'll, I'll make it work. I'll, I'll start with the two. And I'll stick about a set.

1:01:16 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  I appreciate it. There's, there's ways we can position it. So like sucks that guy got a little bit out of shape.  But it's just like, Hey, buddy, like, that's, that's the market. That's not your business necessarily. That's just what's happening in the market.  So I imagine when we, when we look at your business, it will, you know, and, and when they react to like that, I would almost be like, um, well, hey, do you know, actually how a multiple is determined, you know, um, it's based on a lot of factors.  It's not just your revenue. So there's all these other factors that go into making a multiple, which is perceived risk.  So, you know, I don't want to do you a disservice by telling you a number without actually getting more information from you and figuring  out a more accurate picture of what yours looks like, you know? So I'm giving you a range so you can get an idea, but how long have you spent building this business?  Do you really want me to tell you me what the last 20 years of your life is worth after a 20 minute conversation?  Like turn it back around on that, you know? So as of right now, the responsible thing for me to do would be to give you a range of what what similar businesses are doing in your, know, industry and size, but we're going to work with you to try to get the best possible deal for you, you know?

1:02:36 - AcquiMatch Team
  Yeah. Yeah, I mean, I mean, it's possible that guy was just rude.

1:02:49 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  For a person to spend months with owners, breaking their dreams, you know, bringing them back down to reality. So I hear them talk about it so much, like how unrealistic  their expectations are, you know, you guys are on the front lines with that too. So I'm not surprised they would have a  reaction.  I had that with the guy, the property management company in New York, which might be worth checking back in with them.  He was doing 800 in the SDE, and he wanted $10 million. We spent multiple calls together, and I was like, look, I'm so sorry.  Like, I think your business is amazing, and I can find a buyer for it, but not at $10 million.  And I was like, you're going to have to get to at least 2.5 million in SDE to be able to get $10 million on an exit.
  ACTION ITEM: Check in w/ NY/NJ property management co. owner from ~1 yr ago. Assess current interest, valuation expectations.
 - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/241817422?timestamp=3816.9999  And we just, you know, had to let him go because it's just like, it's like, let him sit. been a year now.  I loved him. loved his, it's worth seeing if he's around still Ryan. He was in New York, New Jersey, property management company.  Solid business. I was even like, I might buy this one if he came to realistic expectations, you let him stew for a while on it.  it's like, you really want it, you think you can get it to like two million on your own, you got enough gas left in the tank to do this for another however many years to get it to the point that you got 10 million.  So I just saw the time. Anyways, good. Thanks for being open to being challenged on that. I challenged me back.  If you tried a couple times and it doesn't  work, challenge me back. And I all y'all hopefully know that like I like to be challenged back.  And let's try some things out if it doesn't work. And it doesn't work.

1:04:43 - AcquiMatch Team
  mean, like, honestly, my my viewpoint before was the two to floor and I was doing that and I was comfortable with that.  And then when he got me with that, I started thinking I was like, I trying to undercut this guy?  So to support our clients and he Felt that and I was being slightly honest and I didn't like that, you know, I was like in my head I knew it was three to four and he caught that and he pushed in my face and I was like, dang, I didn't I didn't enjoy that, you know, so I like, all right, I'll be I'm gonna do this different, so but it's true businesses can sell for 2x, so it could be just that he was just he was upset about that, but sorry.

1:05:24 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  I would never I mean, I would never want us to see clients put something forward that was like unfair to the seller, right, but when you get under the hood and it's like that guy had one customer, you know, and it's like, oh , like there's a lot more risk or have had volatility or has done, I don't know, any number of things that would warrant like a smaller multiple, but like then there's things we can build in like performance based notes or whatever, like have him stay on as a consultant or, you know, earn commission off sales or something like that.  So there's so many ways to get them to their number, but And it's so hard to do off the first one or two conversations before we really get into it, like what the risk factor is with them, which is ultimately what determines the multiple, right?  It's like, what's, what's the risk?

1:06:17 - AcquiMatch Team
  Yeah. Okay.

1:06:21 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Cool. Anything else? know I've kept y'all later. So it sounds like we've rounded out the month really well. David, it sounds like you've been voraciously learning all of the things too.  So that's exciting. And yeah, we've got Justin starting to expand. So we'll have another client on the books.

1:06:45 - AcquiMatch Team

I appreciate all the, the work you do to try to bring them along and the patients that you have with them.  I think it's really exceptional. So I appreciate that. Luke, I know you used to send me that right. I don't want to read it.  So it sounds like you're really excited about the work that you're turning out to and putting out good write-ups and stuff.  David, I've been getting really good feedback from the team and you're learning things very quickly.
