# AcquiMatch Buyers Club 07/09/2025

[00:00:00] 

**Athena:** Hello. Hello.

Welcome. Welcome.

**Gil:** Hey 

**Athena:** Kendall. 

**Gil:** Hey,

**Athena:** let's see, who else have we got? I think Polly might be logging in. I think Justin's here. Hey Polly, how are you? 

**Polly:** Good, how are you doing? 

**Athena:** I'm good, thanks. A little wet over here in Texas. I'm wondering how Justin's doing, 'cause I think he got hit hard too. Um, do you hear Justin?

I am here. How, how was the, how was the flooding up? Are you 

**Justin:** crazy? Yeah, we were, uh, an hour outside of like ville, like the thick of it all, but, uh, I mean, no danger for us, just lots of water and general flooding. But, uh, [00:01:00] yeah, we were rented Airbnb, Airbnb with the family, and unfortunately we're kind of kept inside the house the entire.

**Athena:** Oh God, that sucks. Yeah, that was a 

**Justin:** bummer. 

**Athena:** Um, so for everyone else, if you didn't, uh, there's been like some really crazy weather in like Austin, new Braunfels area and just like lots of flash floods, um. Which is weird 'cause I don't remember a summer ever raining this much, but we, um, we're right next to the river where we are and like it, we drove by it after one of the floods and there was like seaweed, like a quarter to a half a mile, like down on the fence, like away from the river.

It was crazy. Um, but yeah, uh, my, um, boyfriend's son got like swept off the road in his mom's car and like into a ditch. It was pretty, and yeah, they're, they're everyone's okay. Luckily, I was 

**Polly:** gonna say, is he okay or ask if he was okay. 

**Athena:** Terrified. You know, that's a horrible thing for a [00:02:00] teenager to go through, but Yeah.

Yeah. Um, so yeah, it's nice to see everyone. Um, curious to hear how a few of your deals are going. Um, so Polly, I was gonna start with you 'cause you guys have a really interesting situation with all these p and ls going on. So, um, do you just wanna give a quick overview so everybody can kind of follow along and then, and then maybe give us some updates since you've had some broker conversations?

**Polly:** I'll do the best I can. So this particular franchise is part of a, it, it's, it's a brand of other franchises under the parent company. Um, it's a, it's a cabinet kitchen, cabinet tree and design business. So they're a one stop shop. So they do the kitchen cabinets, they do. The flooring, if you need that. They do any construction that needs to be done, especially if you're moving things around.

Um, the, the back [00:03:00] splash with the tiling, they do all of that. So it's a turnkey package. And, um, it's, it's based in like the, the Chattanooga area. So it has three, they, they have three locations, two of which. Don't really bring in a lot of revenue, and one of which does that's. Actually in the original location, it was, it was a different business prior to becoming this, uh, this, um, cabinetry, uh, and design business.

And so, um, anyway, it does the most amount of business of the three. And a lot of that business is contractor business, but they do have some walk-in business. And with the other locations, it's primarily a walk-in business and the whole franchise is set up with all the systems that normally a franchise would be set up with CRM, you know, invoicing, all of all of the things.

Marketing, they don't do a lot of marketing actually. Um. [00:04:00] They have a 78% conversion, and that's mainly from just people walking in the store. And I learned that they do have a call center, but the call center really does not, um, include the de design cabinetry business because there are too many variables, um, in that.

So they really use the call center more for the other brands, which are like roofing and. Um, gosh, I can't think off the top of my head. There's like other home-based or, or home oriented, I should say, type of businesses. So they're able to do a lot more quoting over the phone and that kind of thing. So the call center's not really used.

It's, it's really walk in business and, um. And relationships with contractors. Local contractors are going out doing new builds and all that kind of thing, and, uh, and putting their cabinetry in. So like 70% of their business comes from cabinetry. Um, and of course there's a great profit in that and I think everybody knows that.[00:05:00] 

Um, so, you know, we've been, we've just been trying to decide based on the fact that anytime you're dealing with, um, franchises, you're dealing with fees and you're, you know, you've got, that's taken off of the gross revenue and so, you know, it, it makes you a little, it, it, going through the agreement, the actual franchise agreement.

Checking to see if there were any surprises, which really and truly there weren't. I mean, they pretty much aligned with everything that was said in the writeup, I guess. Um, you know, our biggest thing is do we wanna own a franchise business paying all these fees and so forth. Um, and, and, and. The majority of the business is coming from one location of which they're going to actually relocate, even though, even though it's only like 10 minutes away from the original location.

So the contractors aren't going anywhere, but they're trying to improve the walk-in business. So [00:06:00] from what the broker tells me, all three locations, you know, they're, they're getting a decent amount of traffic coming in. I, I would love to know each one of those conversion rates. I haven't asked him that question yet, but I guess really the long and the short of it is Steve and I are trying to decide if we can see ourselves in this business.

They have a couple of managers who manage all three locations. They have designers in each location. It's more of a semi-absentee type of business, but because it hasn't been. Hasn't been doing as well as they had hoped. The owner himself is like a, a co, um, I, I guess you would call him the lead franchisor of all of these brands, including the cabinetry brand.

So these three stores are his, and he's just not been able, I think, to pour in the attention to these businesses. So he, that's why he's selling them. So it's kind of, it's kind of an interesting situation [00:07:00] because. You would think if you were trying to, you know, sell franchises that you would be using your own businesses as an example.

**Steve:** Holly, you wanna tell 'em about the, uh, different p and ls and how stuff doesn't match and et cetera? 

**Polly:** What, yeah, I mean, on the p and Ls there was quite a bit of missing numbers, and the numbers were because they were pulling from different locations, primarily that first location that does the most amount of business, paying for what?

They needed to pay in some of the other locations. So they were kind of, they were kind of messed up. The, the p and ls were, and I had to ask for, uh, clarification on that through the broker, and he's been really great at answering all of our questions. But basically he came back and said, yeah, when you look at those, you have to see that that missing information is actually where you see like maybe one store has paid for digital marketing or whatever.

And the other two stores don't have anything in that category. It's all coming from that other store. So [00:08:00] it's a little interesting. Um, did 

**Athena:** they do a negative add back for the, all the royalty brand marketing tech fees for like all three stores? I've, I've lost track of the, the financial audit, but like, that was the big one that wasn't coming through on the most exp, the, the most, the best performing store.

So like in the sim or in the numbers, did they include what, what you would be paying as a franchisee rather than the franchisor? 

**Steve:** I. Are you waiting on some more numbers back, Paula? Because you're right, there's, there was some of the stores weren't paying a franchise fee, right? One of 'em was paying a franchise fee and how does that work?

So I think you, the broker's supposed to get you some more numbers and clarifications on that. 

**Polly:** Yeah, he is. And um, we're just, we're just trying to work through all of this and really be able to take like a real valuation of the business so we can actually make a determination, you know, is this. [00:09:00] Something that's worth pursuing, even though we, we weren't really interested in Fran in a franchise business to begin with.

Um, but you know, I, I, we just, I guess we're just gonna have to wait till we get all of the information from the broker in, probably, hopefully by the end of the day he'll have that for me, um, with the fees and so forth. But it's just, you know, it's just actually getting the numbers, being able to really. Do evaluation of the business and decide if we want to be, if we want to, you know, do an LOI and so forth.

So that's kind of where we're at right now. 

**Athena:** So I'm, I'm curious because like my comfort level is definitely pushed on this one. Mm-hmm. Yeah. No, it's all my risk tolerance that matters, right? It's yours. So, um, what's keeping you interested in the, in this business is are there other variables or things that you're just in love with?

Or are you using this [00:10:00] as a, a, you know, kind of learning exercise? Like, tell me where you're at in that regard. Like, numbers aside, how are you feeling? About the business, learning 

**Polly:** a little bit of a learning experience, but. I actually visited, um, one of the Atlanta locations and, um, it's, it's in a great area.

So, um, you know, I thought that was actually good. I wanted, you know, talk to the, talk to the, um, franchisee and she was very, very good about answering all my questions. I mean, the showroom was really nice. She had a. A little bit of a background in building and, and working with contractors and so forth. So she definitely has some relationships that she's been able to, um, utilize through some contractor, um, contractors that she had dealt with in her, in her, um, previous career.

And, um, you know, I, I guess you know, what I told Steve is I can see myself doing that business 'cause I do have. Some [00:11:00] design background for, you know, commercial, um, restaurant design to health and, and, um, fitness, well, fitness center design and hotels, and even in health clubs and that kind of thing. I can get, I can get through that and understand everything but.

You know, I, I just don't know, honestly, we're just trying to make a decision like Steve really can't see himself totally in the business. So, I mean, when you're dealing with both of us, you, we, I guess we both have to see ourselves obviously in the business, in, in whatever capacities there are for us to do, you know, he's gonna be better at some things.

I'm gonna be better at some things. And some of it's just a learning process just to go through because we've never actually. Sat down and looked at a franchise business. So it's probably good that we're going through this to determine if we, you know, ever wanna look at one again. 

**Steve:** I dunno, we can't, we can't even figure out the, uh, financial model template with just one p and l.

We're trying with three right [00:12:00] now, so we're really gonna test ourselves. Um, but I, yeah, I, I think the biggest concern is that, okay. Two of the businesses aren't really making money, number one. At least it doesn't look like they're, they're, they're like the smallest part. So would they even be able to stand on their own, number one?

Uh, and then when you start putting it into that perspective, is it even if, if the franchise thing was the way we're going to go, why not just. Pay a franchise fee and open a new building, it's actually a lot less expensive. There's less risk on the table. And right now with a, you know, 33% chance of succeeding, uh, at least from what we've seen in front of us, it's, it's more of just, I think going through it's gotta be almost like a no brainer.

Wow, this really does make sense. But I think we're so deep into it right now, whether we choose to do it or not. Uh, it's something we didn't even consider. Um, it, it's interesting enough, and like Polly said, she's got kind of a [00:13:00] background in that, so I think it's more interesting for her looking at it. But I think at the end of the day, it's, it's the numbers that are gonna make the most sense.

Yeah. I figured. Gonna ride it out until we decide. Yeah. Is it, is it a, is it worth putting up with all the bs, 

**Athena:** right? Yeah. You're, you're pot invested and you're waiting for the river.

I don't know if people know poker terms, but it's like sometimes you're in a hand and you're like, I just gotta see the last card before I decide whether I push the chips in or not. 

**Polly:** Yeah. It's been a, you know, it's been good though in the sense that it really does make you, you think, you know, is this something that we would ever wanna consider?

No matter if it's this one or in the future, any other franchise that would come our way, you know, and, and then, um, that was, that was never on our radar. In fact, that was a big, like, oh no, you know, I don't think so. That's, that's not anything we wanna pursue. So, um, but we're not gonna also waste a bunch of [00:14:00] time either, you know, they do have a strong LOI apparently, and, uh, got a little bit of a low down on who, uh, who.

The type of buyer he is. He's, he's a total absentee buyer, actually. Um, he has said that he would come up there and spend some time in the business for six months or so. He's from Tampa and he's in the medical business and has made a lot of money off of that. So this would be just kind of like, you know, maybe a fun purchase.

I don't know. I don't know where he, I don't know where he is with his, uh. Um, you know, what this business would really mean to him. But anyway, that's, that's the only LOI they have right now. 

**Athena:** So I guess my big questions at this point is like, if the big business is, is subsidizing the other two, what would the real.

Cost be for each [00:15:00] location. And is there a way I probably not at this point. This is probably a Q of E stage, right? Somebody extracting like what expenses go where, and then also what would the royalty fees be, and did they calculate the original overall SDE, including all of. Fees, the royalty fees. Yeah.

Everything. Like was that, were you given a number that included all of that, or is there gonna be additional costs down the line? Um, but also like, like Steve said, what's the cost to start one of these versus, because it's essentially like. I mean, the big location will be in new location mode again, which that makes sense with some contractor business, but even still it's, it's unproven to move to a new location.

Then you have these other two that are hanging on by a thread and the guy that supposedly created this franchise. [00:16:00] He's not, not doing better. I don't know. I, it makes me uncomfortable, deeply uncomfortable, 

**Steve:** I think. I think on the positive side, Polly went out to see a location, so it takes that step. It's another step in redirection.

Yeah. Uh, but we had a conversation last night if the numbers that come back aren't so great, and we had a discussion, maybe it's a good discussion for right now too, with everybody in the group. Yeah. The idea, once we put an LOI, if it's accepted now, we, we've gotta take a look. There's an additional investment for like Q of E, et cetera.

So that, that's a step that we are going to commit to at that point. So we we're talking, you know, we, we are actually talking through and, and just. You know, the differences of an IOI and an LOI, and you know, why, why would anybody even use an I? Oi, I, we had this discussion last night. I don't know if we had a clear answer with ourselves.

**Athena:** Um, so, uh. Why [00:17:00] would anyone use an IOI? Is your is your question? 

**Steve:** Yeah, that's the question. Why not you? Why do people use it when really you're, it's nothing means anything until there's an LOI. What's the point of oi? 

**Athena:** Well, just to your earlier point, when you sign an LOI, you are committing to doing due diligence, but.

Like, at least in, in our methodology, we don't want you to start paying for the QV or the legal and until you at least have some lenders look under the hood, which doesn't cost you anything but time and frustration, right? Getting 'em all the documents and that sort of thing. So usually though, if it's not lendable, then you wouldn't pay for all the, the next stuff.

So, um, the, the difference between an IOI and an LOI or why you would use one or the other, I don't love iis. Um. Because usually broker can, it's, it's, it's there, there, it doesn't tie into any exclusivity, which is like the LOI gives you some breathing room to have exclusivity to, to start looking under the hood and not have the pressure [00:18:00] of, is somebody else gonna steal this away from me at this point?

IOI is just like basically saying what you would buy the business for, but none of the terms. So it doesn't include things like working capital or owner transition or any of that additional stuff. It's just like, I would pay this much money. Um, maybe you might include how that's broken down into seller notes and that sort of thing.

Um, but brokers can typically use that to then go and negotiate with other buyers saying that they have offers in. Uh, brokers usually use IIS to as a vetting tool to see whether you're offering enough money, right? It's how they get paid. So they just wanna know you're gonna offer enough money and they'll either disqualify you or qualify you, but I think a lot of people lie in the IIS just to get pushed forward.

So as, as if I were a broker, I wouldn't use it because it doesn't really mean anything. Um. But yeah, sometimes in competitive deals or whatever they [00:19:00] ask you to send iis, I don't think it really does you, the buyer, a lot of service if you're truly interested in a business, unless you're like, take it or leave it.

This is my offer and this is your, you're, you're kind of like removed from the outcome, but you're like, well, under these circumstances, maybe I might buy your business. Here's my offer that you're probably not gonna like, but I'm gonna throw it at you anyway. That's where you can use an IOI to your benefit when you're like, well, maybe at a two x.

This is what I would potentially do here. So in this situation, rather than putting together an LOI, when you get all the information about the financials, if they haven't truly recognized all the royalties that need to be in there, reducing the SCE there, and then probably putting a significant performance note.

Based on the percentage of revenue that that one location is, that they're moving and be like, [00:20:00] so it's a 70% performance note or whatever that you know, of the three, I'm assuming it's like 70, 80% of the revenue, of the three of 'em. 

**Gil:** So 

**Athena:** then I at least. Yeah. So then I would, I would say like, okay, well, we'll, you know, 2.5 x on this SDE, which we've calculated after all the royalties are taken out and the adjusted rent, um, and all the other fees we're gonna have to pay.

Plus, you know, 70, 80% of this is gonna be forgiven if the new location doesn't at least perform as it did at its old location. And that's where I would throw out an IOI, because you're like. It's not even worth us putting together an LOI if we're not on the same page about all of the risks and everything that we would be looking at as a buyer.

**Polly:** That makes sense. 

**Athena:** Learning based on your time going through the whole LOI process, it's just like this one has [00:21:00] risk written all over it. Yeah, but if it was like two, 2.5 80% forgivable. You know, and you know, then it, then it is kind of a startup franchise cost, and you could get in there without having too much risk, and if it didn't work out, if the new location didn't move or whatever, right?

Mm-hmm.

But like, putting that in front of 'em, they, they'd be like, no, you know? And then every, every other offer will fall through and then at some point they'll circle back and be like, so, you know that, uh, IOI that you gave us, is that still good? You know? 

**Gil:** Yeah. Um, 

**Athena:** so that, that's when you use an IOI when you're like, I'm out unless you give me an exceptionally good price and completely mitigate all of the risk on this, here's what it might look like.

If, if you like that, then we can put together a an LOI. Okay. 

**Polly:** Good to know.

Uh, anybody had in the group any [00:22:00] experience and, and with, uh, franchise businesses consider considering purchasing a franchise business?

**Justin:** I get hit up a lot around franchise brokers constantly on LinkedIn and I mean, it's like there're a time, a dozen. 

**Gil:** Yeah. 

**Justin:** But, uh, I, no, I've never actually entertained a conversation or, or pursued it. Um, I, I don't think I have anything inherently against them other than. Same thing, like additional fees. And, um, I, I get the, you know, I've listened to some acquiring minds and whatnot that went the franchise route, and I get it, like there's some benefits around a structure or like a support system sort of following a blueprint or a playbook.

Matter of fact, a lot of the, uh, the folks who've spoken to it say that that's a great first purchase, like first business purchase for somebody int space because it's kind of like training wheels. Extent. Sure. 

**Gil:** Yeah. Um, 

**Justin:** for me personally though, I, I just see that as the same, the same [00:23:00] restrictive environment that I don't want to have on what I'm personally for me, what I'm looking for.

I'd rather just kind of operate the way I see fit without, you know, the kind of format that I, I would probably be, you know, beheld and beholden to. Um, but that's just me again. I mean, I, but I get the value. I mean, I, there's certainly good franchises that do really well, you know? Yeah. 

**Athena:** And, and, and that's the thing.

It's like when there's a huge brand reputation, right? Like if you're gonna get your oil changed, you're probably gonna look at Jiffy Lube, right? Like mm-hmm. Or if you want tires, discount tire, right? Like there's brand recognition that you just. Inherently go to that, that you're paying for. That's usually what you're paying for with franchises or somebody that's figured out something that's complicated or super niche.

Um, we just discovered this, this company called uh, duty calls. Like, [00:24:00] like pet duty, you know? Oh yeah. Um, and we're customers of them now and they have this like twenty four seven call center where you can call and they'll schedule someone to come out and they, they clean up the dooo out of the yard and they just come on a weekly basis and you're on a monthly subscription with them.

And they'll even like de deodorize the lawn, which I don't know how they do that, but whatever. And I'm just like, what a brilliant business design, right? Like they've got an amazing call center, like, you know, you just need to like buy in your local neighborhood. They're doing all of the marketing, everything generating leads for you.

You just need to go and deliver this service. And like, and it's something that's so like. I don't know any, there's not a lot of competition there. No. But people are creating like a, but if, like, everybody wants that, nobody wants to pick that up themselves. Like it's a Yeah. Business model at least by the sounds of it.

**Steve:** So, but, but the other thing Athena, you're saying though, is that, that that's another, that's another piece of this business. This isn't just picking up. [00:25:00] Dog poop. Right? This is, there is design element to it. So this is, you can't just put anybody who can, uh, put french fries in and pick it up. That's, that's another thing.

And then, and then the brand itself, I had never heard of it. It's not like, oh yeah, we know them. It's, it's not like, you know, whatever you're, you're, you see like the, uh, was it cool Ray or whatever, the air conditioning that it's kind of, they're, they're. That national brand, it's more of a regional, and they've got a few stores.

So that was, that's another, I guess, negative. But as, as you said, we're, we're so deep into it. We wanna see how it plays out. And if nothing else, we get experience putting multiple p and ls into the financial calculator. Yeah. And, and learn something there. So, yeah, 

**Athena:** I mean, it's a masterclass kind of in, in.

Finances for you guys, like really digging into p and ls and looking at like every line item. 'cause um, for, uh, for everyone's information, it's all of, all three of the p and ls for the [00:26:00] stores have different things in them. It's, it's not like I do. They don't, they don't have the same line items for every single store.

There's like different ones. There's things that are missing. There's things that are in one store that aren't in the other two or vice versa. So it's, it's very confusing as to like, what does it actually take to run a store? So, but because of that, I think you're, you're learning kind of like financial analysis in a way that you might not have been able before when you're just looking at one location's p and l.

So you can be like, well, what, what is that line item? Do we actually need that? Right. And you're able to compare across stores, like the, the amount that they pay for contractors at one store was like 7%, and then in another store it was 0.5%. Like that's a huge variance store to store. So I, I love that you're looking at this as like, you know, learning and that sort of thing.

Um, but I do think you'd have to. Hit him pretty low on an offer with a huge performance [00:27:00] note before you move forward on something like that? Oh yeah, 

**Polly:** absolutely. And I, I told him that we would have an answer. I told, um, the broker we would have an answer by Wednesday. So. That's tomorrow. I know, but you know, let, let's call it Thursday at the latest.

I said by Wednesday evening. But by Thursday morning, I mean, we'll, we'll get this thing figured out. Hammered out pretty, we have to pretty quickly 'cause you know, it's time to move on to the next thing basically. And don't wanna drown ourselves in this if this is something we're not gonna do. 

**Athena:** So, yeah. Um.

I, I did personally look at a printing mail franchise like a long time ago to answer your earlier question, has anybody looked into this? 'cause I, you know, I see a lot of still opportunities and like, we need certain things printed and virtual mailboxes and having mailboxes, you know, um, uh, and the location that wanted to sell.

They were a franchise group, right? And they had been running their shop [00:28:00] for 20 years, like we're a huge part of the community, like sponsored community things, whatever. They were the highest grossing store of the entire network for like 20 years into the seven figures. Um, which none of the other stores really broke seven figures and the franchise group.

Like this location was so successful, the franchise group would send their representatives down to get free consulting from this owner, and then they'd send other, you know, new franchisees or potential franchisees over to this shop and like have him like just do all this training. And he's just a, you know, him and his wife, good hearted people that wanted to help but didn't realize like, no, they should be.

Like paying you money to do that and take you out of your business. And then on top of that, there was no, there was no ceiling or shift for like breaking seven figures. They were still paying the same amount of royalties. So when it came down to looking at what his [00:29:00] SCE was on a business that was north of seven figures, him and his wife's take home was about $150,000 a year.

Franchise franchisor was making as much, if not more than they were. Yeah. Running, you know, and, and they were sponging off him for consultancy. So like that, that kind of stuff makes me angry 'cause they've been, you know, building that business for 20 years and weren't even gonna be able to retire off of it.

Yeah. So, you know, that's my other question, and I don't, I don't, I haven't looked at enough franchise agreements to know, like, are, is there a waterfall of fees when you, like, how are, how are you rewarded for busting it past a level that other people are not? You know? Right. 

**Polly:** Yeah. Yeah, that's very true. 

**Athena:** Um, anyways, uh, good food for thought and uh, interesting stuff.

So any, any uh, questions or [00:30:00] anything we can help with in your analysis or you kinda, it's clear on where you need to go from here? 

**Polly:** I think it, yeah, I mean, it's clear on where we need to go from here. Like I said, once we, once we finish modeling it out and we will determine whether we do wanna make a really low ball offer or we don't want to do it at all.

So. We should know that by tomorrow when we talk with you on our meeting. 

**Athena:** Great. Awesome. Looking forward to it. Nice work. Um, cool. Um, so Justin, I was gonna pick on you next 'cause you have a interesting. Risk situation that you're looking at right now. If you wanna give an overview and talk that through.

'cause I think it's, something comes up a lot if you wanna talk about it. If not, 

**Justin:** no, no. Yeah, no, it's fine. 

**Athena:** I was like, uhoh. 

**Justin:** No, it's just this is not something that I'm taking too seriously. Not, not to say that I, I'm flipping about it. It's just. If this is not one that's like a make or break, I, you know, I've gotta bend over [00:31:00] backwards to figure out how to make this happen at all.

It's a distance. It's more of a, of a curiosity based around the situation. The nutshell for the, for the team is that I. So Luke brought to my attention an opportunity with a broker, and it turned out not to be the perfect fit, but then the broker's like, but I got this other thing. Like, do you wanna talk about that?

So it was kind of an off the record or an off the track situation. Well, it, it's effectively, it's like this community, uh, in the real estate. Kind of guru space where it's like people buy into like annualized subscriptions or memberships for an education platform in real estate investment. Um, I actually know the guy who runs it, the guy who's selling it, because I took a webinar that he conducted like two years ago as an investor.

Not, I wasn't ever gonna join the community, but I wanted to learn around where he specializes in his asset class. And that's something that I'd looked at developing myself as an investor and a developer. [00:32:00] Um, and I was like, great, well he teaches this. Let's hear what he has to say. Uh, funny enough, one of my real estate investment colleagues did join his program.

And so anyway, we had these weird ties together and now he's selling the actual program that I joined the webinar. It's weird. Small world situation. Well. He is a, he is a guru. Like he is a social media personality. He's an influencer. He is, you know, that kind of thing. The entire business has historically been predicated on his personal brand.

So he is synonymous with his business. He's the face, he's all, he does content creation. He is all over social media and all the platforms. He's like in his space, he's well known. Um. And so it was interesting when they brought this to my attention 'cause I was like, I actually want, well, one, I know him or not know him, no, but like I know who he is, uh, by, by reputation.

I know his business model very well because I'm a, I am a part of some memberships and kind of think tanks in the real estate investment space. Not his space, but others. So I know [00:33:00] general how the model works. Um. It was curious to kind of peek behind the curtain and see how his operation runs. Well, because he's his brand, he's looking to get into real estate development and opportunities that are very large in scale.

He is got this like operation in Dubai that he's looking to, it's tens of millions, if not hundreds of millions. It's, it's substantial and it's taking a lot of his time where he looking to get out of this like community ownership business and really just go into the actual developer. Real estate side of this.

Um, and so he is offloading the business and the risk is as organic as it sounds. I mean, he is the business, his face is the business. It's, there is no other connection that the market understands. So how do you decouple? Not only is it key matter risk, but the key, like the only key man, the person in this thing, how do you run successfully a business that is so incumbent on the person's personal [00:34:00] reputation?

Um, and I asked him that. I go, look, that's my question. I'm gonna grill you because one, I've got nothing to lose. I'm not really, it's more of a morbid curiosity. Why? I'm into this, 

**Gil:** right? 

**Justin:** And, and so I was like, how do you, what's your counterpoint to this? And he said, well, he's taken, he one for saw this coming.

So he's taken steps to do. So he goes, if you've look at, looked at any of my marketing material, content, anything, he goes, I've released nothing with my face on it in 2025. 'cause I knew the sale was coming. So he, in 2024 and previously he was on every content. He was in the marketing. He was like, they did clips on YouTube, they did all that stuff.

He goes, you haven't seen a lick of that in 2025. And they said, and also, um. And I've also not introduced myself to members. Even as they come in as like the face, the guy you're gonna be seeing, he is like, I, I'm not a part of that. My team knows I'm not a part of that. We've got trainers in, in place to, you know, man the community, so to speak.

Um, and cryptically, he goes, I've got a whole playbook [00:35:00] for however, the new buyer coming in wants to run it. So if they want to be the new face, the new public persona. I've got a playbook for that literally, that we've written on step by step how to execute. Prepared to execute, uh, on that behalf. If you don't wanna be that person.

We've got that playbook. So if you don't want, and I don't, I told 'em, look, I'm gonna tell you right now, I'm not gonna be a public fa, like I don't want to be a social media personality. That the furthest thing from an area of interest for me. You'd 

**Athena:** be so good at it though. 

**Justin:** I, I, well, I was an actor. That was a life, I had a very public persona for the time, pre-social media.

So it wasn't that public, but, you know, public ish, because I was on camera all the time and I was used to it. I just don't wanna be that guy because your life is about content creation and this like facade. And I want to be a bi, I wanna run a business. I don't wanna be a personality. Right? Um, like I only Tony Robbins for real estate, so.

I told him, I was like, I have no interest in that. [00:36:00] So already I'm gonna tell you like it's, I, I'm interested as a business owner. And are the fundamentals in place? Like, is this profitable? How are you envisioning that? So they're holding that close to the vest. They said, I'll share that when we're like in LOI because, uh, he's ensuring that he's not spinning his wheels for no reason with tire kickers.

I get it. At the same time, I don't wanna spin my wheels. Run due diligence and model the modeling and feel these conversations if I'm like, this was all snake oil to begin with. Like you weren't, this was never a sellable business, you know? Um, so we're at this kind of like game of chicken on like where to go next.

Short of, they're like, basically we want you to submit an LOI, um, an interesting curve ball is yesterday the broker called me. Uh, they recognized by the broker fully recognizes like, there's key man risk to this. You know, that's, I think why they haven't sold it yet. And that is a major market concern, uh, as it should be.

And I said, uh, he said, Hey, just to kind of [00:37:00] sweeten the deal, there's 200,000 of accounts receivable that we'll convey with the business. So they're like making it, you know, like trying to give comfort and like you're gonna have runway. As you're stepping into this thing, um, I mean, debatable, that should have always been a part of the, you know, deal based financial Yeah, it's probably 

**Athena:** like working capital.

That was determined that, yeah, 

**Justin:** in the 

**Athena:** business contracts as well. Like if he signed up a bunch of people and you gotta deliver for the next. 12 months. Like the, is that the amount of money I'm gonna need to deliver for this? 

**Justin:** Exactly. I'm not taking on your clientele that you're gonna be reaping the financial rewards for and I gotta deliver on with nothing to show.

Like, no. So that was probably always gonna be part of my, actually, my offer anyway. Should I get to that point? But that's what they called to say. So they recognize this is a, a quirky one. Um, and that's kind of where we sit. So they're hopeful that I'll submit an o. [00:38:00] 

**Athena:** I am like, I just, uh, yeah. Interesting. I, it sounds like you're, you're out on it.

You were just having fun kinda exploring it. I mean, it, it 

**Justin:** was because I know the personality, I wanted to meet him and see what he had to say about it, because like he's got his social media personality. I'm like, is that really you? Like, you know, whatever. I mean, the, the upside is I believe he is an investor and knows the space, right?

So yes, he's monetized this educational platform to teach others and, and honestly it is credible. There's, it's. Complete smoke and mirrors. I mean, he does know what he's talking about. He has developed this asset class. He knows what he's doing. My, my, honestly, the value I see in it is, is there a way to do what a lot of gurus who run the, and again, I have, I know this world, so it's like, is what a lot of them do, will start these educational platforms, release content, bring in students, and then use their students as their own, [00:39:00] like.

Opportunity, like deal flow opportunity. 

**Gil:** Mm-hmm. 

**Justin:** So they partner, they end up partnering with their students and they say, look, I'll be your guarantor on the deal and you give me 10% equity. Right. Or whatever. It's like they, they cut themselves into some equitable position and they've now have investment opportunities because they've got deal finder.

They've now got hundreds of deal finders. More who are now in flow like flowing into their business model. I don't wanna, uh, by no means would ever wanna take advantage of anybody, you know, without actual partnership and actual value added. But there is merit to basically building this infrastructure of real estate investment opportunity because it's a very real thing that very real people I know do with their students.

And. Generational wealth off of that alone. Right? So, um, you know, there is validity there. That's a valid approach. Now to what extent that would be [00:40:00] capable, at least in the early days, probably lesser than where I be that personality who's already been around the block and whatever. But, um, he says he is got a sales team.

He say it's fairly automated. He only contributes a few hours a week to the business. Obviously I would be contributing more, would have to, um. But he is done as much as he can to make it sound like this is an automated playbook with sales managers and sales teams who run the motion. You just throw marketing dollars and, you know, kind of, you know, the, on the business stuff and it'll deliver what it's delivering or, or, or, or more.

So the, that's kind of the quirk of this. 

**Athena:** Yeah. But who's gonna make the content? Going forward. 

**Justin:** So he's, they've got a content team. I mean, he's been the guy, they've got like an in-house production effectively. I mean, it was his wife, it was his brother. Like they have people involved. But he says he's got a, he's farmed out a content team now that kind of will run that.

And it doesn't have [00:41:00] to include me as the face, nor would I want it to. Right. But like they'll create the content engine that's part of their strategic playbook that they're gonna pass on to the buyer. It. As far as like scripts, I mean, they have scripts written, they've got like, it's all scripted, you know, it's like a TV show that they're, they map out on socials.

**Athena:** Oh, okay. Yeah. The, um, we were, we were at Hormo e hq, um, are you familiar with the Hormoze? Yeah. Yeah. So a, like when they sold gym launch, Alex was obviously the, the face of that. So they, like, during their sale and during the transition, they had to like go through the whole thing of like, yeah, to get ready for sale, like transitioning 'em out.

But man, we were listening in on some of the paid ad, like, um. They, they go like with different business owners, they'll go through like deep dive and you get to like listen in on the stuff and just the way you have to do paid ads. Now the amount of content that you have to make, you have to change out the [00:42:00] ads, the copy on a weekly basis, like mm-hmm.

To keep it fresh and keep those leads coming in. Like it's so much work. So I mean, if, if he's been doing that all of this year without him being the face. And the numbers have like continued to perform well, that might be interesting, but then like, you know what, what about getting into the community? So, um, so I guess I didn't, I didn't tease out from that last, uh, thought you had was like, where, where are you at with it?

Are you toying with it or. 

**Justin:** I mean, it's like a distant third or fourth compared to the other deal. Right? Yeah. Which, not which 

**Athena:** I was gonna ask you about because um, I, yeah, you've got two. 

**Justin:** I've got two I'm far more interested in Yeah. That I, I would rather take down. So those are the definitely my priority.

Um, 

**Athena:** any movement on either of those. 

**Justin:** So I got the LOI submitted for the roofing company, um, great. And [00:43:00] waiting on feedback. I mean, the, the broker said, Hey, look, the seller is, was right in the heart of like the storms and the floods and all that. So he's responding to a lot of that. He goes, so he might be slow to like, evaluate.

**Athena:** Oh God. I bet, yeah. Roofs went nuts over the last, yeah. Okay. 

**Justin:** The properties swept away. I mean, who, whatever. Right. 

**Athena:** Our, our route. Like, I mean, I, I didn't realize we didn't have gutters when we moved into this place, and it was just like. Bucketing it down. Like it might have been a, it might as well have been a fire hose on the top of the roof, like coming straight down.

**Justin:** Yep. And it, I mean, it's an event like that that'll really highlight if you've got holes or like you've got leaks in your, like you're gonna know quick with the amount of rain. So he's 

**Athena:** catching back up. For sure. Yeah, he's gonna be busy. 

**Justin:** That's Claudio.

Run that for me, um, and, and get his attention on it sooner than later, I'm sure. So yeah, standing by on that. And then the other one is I talked with, I talked with Matt about [00:44:00] the non SBA coworking space opportunity. He put me in touch with his former boss from like 30 years ago. No kidding. Who works at a bank, but.

For those that don't. Uh, good guy too, uh, reminds me a lot of, Matt sounds like Matt, for those, uh, deals that don't qualify, SBA, he has kind of like freelancer has a side hustle where he is got like a, a private lending club where he's got just individual investors that work within these perfect deal size parameters for that.

Um, so I had a call with him and he is like. He goes, this sounds interesting. He's this, he's lent on coworking spaces, specifically the business model before, so he knows it well. Um, yeah. Good, good call. So I'm sending him the, uh, I gotta send him the sim, my bio, just like some general material so he can look it over.

But, uh, sounds like at least there may be a, I mean, I don't know, term sheet. I don't know anything on, on that, but. Um, you know, financial notwithstanding sounds [00:45:00] like there may be a lead to at least a group that it has the. They've got the funds sitting by to do so, like they're looking to place it. 

**Gil:** That was so cool.

**Justin:** So yeah, so that's, that was a fun chat. Um, yeah, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm trying to find that NDA that I signed 'cause I want to see if it covers my lending representative and I cannot, for the life of me find the NDA. Signed. Signed in any of my material. I thought he saved it. Eda, can 

**Athena:** you pull that out for Justin?

Uh, the work, work lodge one, and in the, 

**Justin:** in the meantime, I did ping the broker who's also really cool. I've got a good relationship with her. It's like, Hey, any issues if I were to like, share the sim with, and I haven't heard back yet, but I'm waiting to see what he says. 

**Athena:** Yeah. Good. If if not, you can have him sign one, but usually it does cover you being able to go out and seek investment.

Yeah. Yeah, if you, if you have happen to 

**Justin:** have access to the nda, that'd be cool. I can check it out. 

**Athena:** Yeah. Edita can pull that for you. No problem. And then we were just pulling [00:46:00] some resources for you all should you need it. We've got two I i, I just need to review it real quick that we've got two non circumvention NDA templates that like are example templates for you all to, to pull from, um, you know.

With these types of groups, they want someone bringing them deal flow and an operator so they don't normally circumvent, but like if you're going to individuals that are also searchers or investors themselves or whatever, or just to like actually cover yourself, um, you can use these non circumvention NDAs, which is like non-disclosure agreement, but also saying like you can't go after the deal once I reveal the details to you.

Um. So I will make sure to review that so we can drop that as a resource to you all too. Um, they're just example ones, so you probably wanna like run it through GPT or something or adapt it to yourself. But there's one from it's Sam Rosa's template, so that's [00:47:00] pretty solid. Um, and then there's a template that I used when I was raising capital also that's a little bit like less legally used, but gets the point across.

So. 

**Justin:** Cool. Yeah, that'd be helpful. Oh, and I did talk to Matt about the roofing company as a potential SV alternative. And, uh, he, well, I didn't talk to me, I told him that I had it and via text he goes, yeah, gimme a call. So I called him and I got his voicemail, but he said, uh, he'd call me back. 

**Athena:** Nice. Cool.

Exciting stuff. Well, um, sounds like some good movement on those things. Um, I'll be interested. Gosh, these like influencer brands are so interesting. Um, just like, I always wonder if you're so good at what you do, why do you start a community and sell it to people? So he's basically like so successful now that he can't do it anymore, right?

Like his, his stuff outside of this is taking off while he can't give it the focus. 

**Justin:** So he, I asked him [00:48:00] why he like what the origin was and he said it didn't, and he didn't even intend to start the business like that. Wasn't like a goal of saying, I'm gonna start this education. He had been investing in the space and developing himself just as an investor.

And he goes, COVID, he goes, and peak of COVID. I was bored. He goes, so I started doing TikTok dances. And he goes, and it's still on my page. He goes, you go to my history, it's there. You can look at me looking silly on TikTok and whatever. I did it because I was bored and, and he goes, and people started engaging with me on TikTok.

Then I had posted some real estate content not to be a guru, just because it was kind of what I was doing and people said, can you show me? Like, you seem to know a lot about this. Can you show me? So he goes, I started to help just a couple people informally that expanded more people. I asked him, he goes and he goes, eventually I'm just like, all right, well let's start a community.

He also knew, what I know and a lot of people in the space know is that you can get like partners and leads. Bolster your [00:49:00] portfolio if you are the guy that everybody brings your deals to, to inform. And he goes, so he goes, I wasn't stupid. He's like, all right, let's do it. And he's, he's like, got equity positions in a lot of his students deal.

**Athena:** That makes sense to me when it's for deal flow, you know? That's why like the hormoze too, because it's like they're just the coolest family office I've ever seen. Um, yeah.

Office.

Everybody knows their names, so they get first pick of like all the deal flow. Plus they've monetized it by like teaching people and getting access to their portfolio team, like on a paid basis, which is still deal flow for them 'cause they get to see how people interact with every it's, it's. Awesome.

They haven't let me down as far as the, the guru side of things, um, at all. Like there's so much legitimacy behind it, and their whole team is phenomenal. Yeah. 

**Justin:** Um, yeah, sometimes there are good ones, like there are, they're real deal people who are now, some of them are complete bs, but 

**Athena:** Right. But I'm always [00:50:00] asking the good one, a good one.

What's, what's the reason, right? Like when I can connect to the reason behind the community, like. Creating deal flow for yourself 100%. Like what a smart way to do it. You're educating people and potentially bringing great deals and they trust you. Mm-hmm. Because you've educated them and got it to that point.

Like that makes sense. But just doing it for the sake of like earning money. Um. Not, 

**Justin:** yeah, I mean the, the amount that he is getting in, in his personal take, like his SD on it, it's not, he's getting way more wealth from his actual investment. So this is not to make a bunch of money for sure. This was, he didn't, he didn't need it, frankly.

And that's honestly why he is also selling. He is like, look. It's just not worth my time anymore. 

**Athena:** Yeah. Um, but to make money, to get deal flow that gives you that kind of wealth is different than like 

**Justin:** why would, why wouldn't you if they, somebody will pay you to then also give you deal flow? It's like, oh, great.

Icing on the cake. 

**Athena:** It's [00:51:00] interesting. Super interesting. We looked at another business, um, kind of similar, um, but, you know, these, these folks that like build these businesses off the back of their. You know, likelihood and face and everything. It's such so dangerous when you do get to this stage where you don't wanna do it anymore.

So, yep. Anyways, all these kids that wanna be influencers, it's like, well, you're creating a little prison for yourself. You'll never be able to get outta. That's, 

**Justin:** that's the other reason why I told him, I go, look, I don't wanna run into the same problem you're having selling your own business. If I'm the face, then I'm going to run into the same issue.

I go, no. If I can standardize the way not to be the face and operationalize the business outside of the personal brand, then I'm setting myself up for a good sale when that time comes. 

**Athena:** Yeah. I will say though that um, not to keep bringing up the Ozzies, I'll drop the podcast link in the Buyer's Club channel.

Alex Ozzi did this podcast about [00:52:00] when his mind finally shifted about, uh, building a brand. 'cause he was super anti doing it for a while, and then realized like, attention is the new oil. And he is like, how is it that, what's her face? Jenner can drop a new brand and like overnight it gets a billion dollar valuation.

**Justin:** Yep. Yeah, it's true. 

**Athena:** So like, you know, it used to be energy, then oil and you know, like now, now it's attention. Attention is one of the most valuable things that you can have. And having people's attention allows you to do a drop and have a billion dollar valuation, even though you know, like you're without that, literally like not doing anything.

**Justin:** I mean the, I check the, I check, same thing, like personal brand, right? 

**Athena:** So that, that kind of got me thinking. Not that I've acted on it whatsoever, but I'm like, okay, I kind of understand and I'm like 5% less repelled by the idea of being, 

**Gil:** yeah, [00:53:00] I, I'll find 

**Athena:** it and dig it out. And you might, you all might find I'll listen to it.

I, I think it's for all of us that are very much like behind the scenes and. I'd rather be running around and just making stuff happen. It's, it's an interesting thought, especially where we're going in the future, like how having, having a platform or having a brand can actually be better for business overall too.

Um, so I'll drop it. 

**Polly:** Oh, sorry, I didn't mean to cut. Talk over you. Go ahead. No, no. 

**Athena:** Yeah, I was just gonna say, I'll drop it and we can have a discussion about it, see how you guys feel about it. 'cause I'm, I'm definitely like not on. It's not my first thought to make content about something. In fact, I like hate it.

You know, my mom can't even get me to take photos when I go on vacation. The team tells me like, okay, you're going to an event and you're going to meet so and so, like take pictures. And they're like, did you get it? You know, to like be able to pull? And I'm like, totally forgot. Yep. Like.

**Polly:** What were you gonna say, Polly? It's just interesting when you're talking [00:54:00] about, you know, influencers because that business that we looked at, um, a couple of businesses ago that were sent, that was sent to us, it was, uh, a business where it was a digital marketing agency and it was very niche to, um, women's only businesses.

And she'd done this amazing job building this business. All the numbers were really good. But she was it. She was the face of the business. And the two people who work for her, I mean, she had this incredibly strong connection with, because she had brought them on, I don't know necessarily we're friends, but she brought them on, had several years worth of this relationship.

And we were, I mean, we were, Steve and I were just like, this is a great business, but it, uh, it's. It's her. I mean, you know, it's her and if, if she goes away, what's that gonna look like? You know, I 

**Athena:** wonder if we're looking at an age where there like, 'cause we've seen [00:55:00] at least three, four of these, you know, examples, maybe even more.

I'm sure you know Luke and the team on the upfront and if seen even more that they haven't passed over to y'all. But this is gonna become a, a bigger, bigger problem. At the same time, we're getting slicker and slicker with ai and I wonder if we're like gonna be in a Black mirror scenario where if people want to sell their business, they also need to sign over.

I. Their likelihood or their, uh, yeah, likeness. Like, is that the word? Like likeness 

**Steve:** name and likeness like, like athletes, yeah. 

**Athena:** Their likeness. Yeah. So you can like, have an AI like still continue to generate content and like get all their channels and everything, but it's not actually them.

**Justin:** Yeah, not a 

**Athena:** lot. It's a 

**Justin:** weird future we live in. 

**Athena:** I know. I'm, I've been obsessed with AI lately. I've been, I've been binging all sorts of podcasts from thought leaders in terms of where it's going and, and what it is. So, um, anyways, on, on that [00:56:00] note, I've kept you a few minutes later, but, uh, good stuff. We'll catch up with all of you tomorrow.

Um. Gil, I know we didn't get a chance to dive deep, but I think you're away tomorrow or was that last week? I am totally, yes. I'm okay. Yeah. Have a good trip. Then tomorrow and, uh oh, let me plug Thursday. John Cipher, the author of Output Thinking, is gonna be with us on Thursday. I actually saw him speak at s and Bash a year, two years ago.

Just really amazing, kind of like. Former business owner and business coach specifically on how to go from operator to owner of a business and has some really cool like processes and things. And one of the things he helps people with is that transition into business ownership when you acquire a business.

So he's gonna be doing a talk or like a presentation and conversation on [00:57:00] are you ready to be an owner? So just some things for you to think of, like going through this process when you get into ownership, how to think about ownership, how to prepare yourself for it. Um, it's the first time we've had an author on, so that's pretty exciting.

So, and uh, I don't know if y'all saw Peter said, I'm actually reading his book right now, so. Um, please join on Thursday if you can. 'cause he is gonna give a really nice talk, but also there'll be plenty of time for q and a after that. He charges a ton of money to do consulting, so we get to pick his brain for free.

Um, so please join us on Thursday if y'all are around, that's gonna be a great one.

Cool. Well, great to see you all. See you tomorrow. Some of you, Gil, have a good trip. Uh, hopefully you see you on Thursday if you're around. Um, and I hope you all have a great evening too. I'll talk to you soon. [00:58:00] Bye.
