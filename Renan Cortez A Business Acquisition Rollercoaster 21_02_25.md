# AcquiMatch Buyer Club 21/02/25

[00:00:00] 



**Athena:** hello. Hello, everyone. Nice to see you. Um, welcome welcome. Hey, Gil. Hey, Justin. I think Polly is logging in, um, probably have a few more join, but like, this is going to be probably I, I, I just. I love Renan to death. So let me let me give you a little bit of information about him and then we're going to dive in because this is absolutely one you're going to want to pay attention to.

It's a nail biter. Hopefully it'll be a script for a movie someday because it deserves to be told. This amazing story. But this is Renata Cortez, who I now consider a dear friend. He's been a huge supporter of me and this business and our journey. Um, and we met in a community a couple years ago. Um, and I knew his story and when I heard his story, it inspired me to think [00:01:00] bigger and that is something that I credit to him is he absolutely swings big and does these unbelievable feats and so when I found out about him, he had, uh, negotiated 100 percent seller financing on an 8 million acquisition of a restoration business and, um, I was like, Hey, I'm gonna do this.

The story itself was unbelievable, but how he handled, um, the seller and the whole process was fantastic. So many of you might have heard his podcast that he did on Acquiring Minds, um, and heard where he got up to, but I feel privileged that I feel like I've had a little bit of a front row seat. And this is the story of what happens next.

And it's not necessarily the story that gets told very often. And it can be harrowing even when you have all the elements of success from the beginning. And I think Renan makes me think two things. One is that you can swing big. And there's nothing wrong with [00:02:00] swinging big and dreaming big and going for big things.

And number two, That resilience is what gets you through and his grit and determination and the way he digs his heels in when things get tough is an inspiration. And so I take inspiration from him both for how to dream big and how to get through it. So he's agreed to come and share today and we're going to tell you why it was a little bit like, we didn't know whether he was going to be here or not, but I'm not going to.

Spoil the story. Cause I, I think where we should start was like kind of in the beginning Renan. So tell us like before you even acquired this business, what were you doing? And how did you even find out about buying a business in the first place? 

**Renan:** So it's funny you say it's going to be a movie. Um, I think it's going to be ever seen the movie Titanic.

It's along on that lines. We'll see how the ending goes. So, um. Oh, man, no, thank you for having me at the end. So, yeah, I haven't done a [00:03:00] podcast or a meeting or just been out talking to anybody for probably 6 months now. Um, yeah, I've been going through some stuff. But we're going to talk about it all, you know, with the great highs come great lows, but we'll, we'll talk.

So what was the question there, Athena? 

**Athena:** Yeah. Like, okay, give us the, just a quick snapshot of life pre searching for a business to buy. What were you up to? What were you doing? And then how did you come across this concept in the first place? 

**Renan:** Oh, yeah. I mean, shoot. I mean, I was in the army for, you know, 12 years and I joined corporate and I was going to go med school.

I did all that, you know, so I did, uh, corporate stuff, uh, pacemaker rep, uh, top companies, and I just wanted to do something different. I felt like I had a bigger calling in life and I tried to figure out what that was. Um, at one point, I tried to start a, uh, cannabis operation in Puerto Rico, um, for a lot of reasons, and I'm, I'm going to keep everything brief because I don't, you know, I know we don't have much time and I want to [00:04:00] answer more questions than just kind of speak, right?

Uh, but I felt this calling, even, I mean, at the age of 44, 45, that's, you know, people are like, that's kind of late in life ish, whatever, you're doing good in corporate, why are you going to change the dynamic? But, you know, the calling for me to get back to the community was bigger. And so I tried to figure out what what that was and how I was going to do it.

Um, it led me through a whole series of things, which ultimately landed me meeting Cody Sanchez down in Austin, um, to pitch her, uh, the, you know, to invest in this cannabis because at the time she had a cannabis fund and that's how I met Cody. And this is before she really, you know, she was on the upswing really.

Blowing up before she she blew up. Um, I would say probably 2 steps before where Athena is for right now, you know, because you're on that upswing also there, Athena. Um, I feel it, but, you know, so that's how I met Cody and that's when I was introduced introduced to this whole concept [00:05:00] of buying a small business.

Which never really heard of before. Um, and once I kind of sat down and listened to it, I still thought it was out of my league. It wasn't for me, it was for, you know, Hewlett Packard, it was for IBM, you know, all the big companies, corporate entities. I never thought it could be on a micro or, you know, uh, lower middle market level.

And, um, once I started researching into it, I joined the community because community is huge. Like minded people, um, researched a lot into it. And found exactly the opportunity that I presented. So that's how I got into the whole business buying aspect. 

**Athena:** Yeah, like many of us, you know, we were doing the corporate thing and felt like there was, there was more available and that we could, we could do more and have more purpose and, and, you know, create things.

So, um, I think a lot of the people are familiar with your podcast and we shared the link, but, you know, in a synopsis, like you, [00:06:00] you found something and you did something. That like nobody I to date. I still don't know anybody that's been able to pull off what you do But you've inspired so many people. So what did you find?

What how did how did the deal come together? Like how did you pull this off? 

**Renan:** So, you know, I, I got just like a lot of people do, they, they get on, you know, Google how to buy a business, you know, I want to buy a business, you know, so then biz buy, sell pops up, um, and a couple other different LoopNet and all these different things start popping up.

You go through biz buy, sell, and you know, it hits you with all these terms, ebitda, you know, this and that, you know, multiples and you don't even know. It's like so daunting. But the thing is, if you dig into it, just like any language, it starts to make sense. And if you're around people and you're always talking about it.

Structuring a deal, you know, different ways of doing things. So, BizBuySell just got, it, it, it wasn't the greatest in, um, in the, the types of [00:07:00] businesses I was finding, I guess. Um, so I did hire, uh, you know, an off market, uh, deal sourcing, uh, uh, agent. And they called on my behalf. I gave them, um, what I was looking for, EBITDA, uh, frame, um, what kind of service, uh, kind of business I was looking for.

And they just went and searched for me, right? Um, they don't close for me, but they, they search and they give me opportunities. Uh, in the first couple of weeks, they found somewhere like 30 or 40 leads, uh, vetted out leads that they spoke to the actual owner. They qualified the revenue, they qualified a lot of the details.

And now it's up for me to go ahead and make the close. Um, I'm confident in my, my selling skills, my closing skills, and that comes from corporate. So that's where I, that's my attribute right there. So, I found, um, I was actually already closing on a dry cleaner, a 700, 000 dry cleaner. It was going to net 250, 000.

That was, you [00:08:00] know, the EBITDA was right around there. Top line revenues were about 500, 000, 600, 000. It was local. Um, and I got approved SBA and this is at a time before all the interest rates went through the roof. Um, my, my, I got approved for like 6. 25 percent APR right at that time. And, uh, it was great.

I was buying the property with it. It was amortized over 25 years. Uh, the payment was low cash flows were great. Um, but then I've the off market deals sourcing people found this restoration company that came up with about 30, 35 employees. Different levels of management, and it was scary. I was like, oh, my gosh, what is what are we doing here?

I wanted something with maybe 3, 400, 000 in EBITDA. This thing had like 2 million dollars in EBITDA. What are we doing, but I went to go look at it anyway, because looking is free get experience. I want to see what what this kind of operation is. And once I took a look at it. It [00:09:00] was just, just like the dry cleaner, except a little bit bigger.

That's really all it was. And, uh, coming from corporate America where I'm used to handling like millions of dollars and, you know, like I worked for Medtronic, that's a 60 billion company I used to seeing big numbers. But I was never responsible for big numbers. Um, like wholly responsible, but I'm used to seeing and finessing big numbers.

So the big numbers was kind of daunting and taking on their responsibility. Once I actually looked at it and saw all the opportunity, I was like, I, how do I get this? But it's, it was an 8. 6 million business. And so that's when I had to get creative on how am I going to be able to purchase this? Um, this business and my fallback if I couldn't structure anything was to get the dry cleaner.

Um, but at the time, I'm thinking 5 employees at a dry cleaner, 2 of them get sick. It's going to be this guy right here, ironing and hanging things up and taking, you know, doing the register. And that really wasn't, isn't what I wanted to [00:10:00] do. Um, I don't mind managing or leading or anything, but I don't want to be back there, sweating my butt off doing, you know, shirts that's just was, that didn't sound fun to me.

Um, so I opted to go and create, uh, a way to buy this business. 

**Athena:** And how did you do it, 

**Renan:** man? It was, it took a lot. So it just for reference, it took about 10 months just to get approved for SBA and to come to 100 percent seller financing. It only took me 3. 5 months. It was just going in, building a relationship with the owners trying to find out why they were selling.

Who am I? What am I trying to do with the business? What am I trying to do in life? And just building and it was not day one that I went in and said, Hey, look, I don't have any money, but I want to buy your business for no, you know, let's structure something. It wasn't that deal at all. I mean, of course, they were curious, like, how are you going to buy this business?

I said, well, well, who said I [00:11:00] want to buy this business? Let's, let's take a look and let's look at the books. Show me around. I want to see if this is even something I want to buy. And then we could get on to how are we going to structure it? And they're like, fair enough. So they spent some time. We spent a couple of weeks, you know, they, they would show me the books.

We built a relationship. And then, um, you know, I told him, I said, so then they, of course, a month later. So, you know, how do you think you're going to, you know, buy this? I'm like, well, look, you know, there, there's a lot of SBA. So it took some education because I had to educate them on. How to properly value their business.

Um, typical ways that people buy a business, you know, it could be SBA alone, conventional alone. It could be a little bit of equity here. A little bit of a seller note. There's multiple ways to do it. Um, and I'm going to try getting a loan. I'm going to try doing this. So they're like, okay, cool. So I said, so, you know, we're still going through the diligence phase.

We're doing all that. And then it got to the point of, um. You know, I made some [00:12:00] phone calls. I was talking to, you know, like a lot of SBA lenders and they're like 8 million. That's kind of past the 5 million mark. Then it becomes like a hybrid type thing. There's no real estate involved. And so it didn't look like I was going to get a loan.

So I spent probably a day or two just building this stupid calculator on Excel on how I would sell or finance this thing. So I could see it for myself really quickly. And two, so I can present it to the owners. Because if you just talk and you're just throwing numbers, people don't see it. They just, they don't see it.

So you have to put it on a visual. And so that's what I did. I put together this really simple Excel spreadsheet and I sat down with them. I said, look, all right, this is what I propose. And, uh, I showed him away. I said, look, uh, where I wouldn't be paying 8 million for their business, it'd be 11. 7 or 11. 6 million.

I'm like, what the hell are you talking about? And then, you know, we, I showed him how I factored in interest. So basically I told him, I said, hey, I [00:13:00] could go to Chase or Bank of America. I could get a loan, which that's a little bit of a, you know, bluff because I couldn't, but I said, if I go get a loan, now I'm paying a payment to Chase.

I'm paying a payment to Bank of America. That's it. You have your money. Boom. Transaction's done. One, what are you going to do with 8 million shot right there? There's a lot of tax involved, you know, that's very hard to address on your taxes. Um, so that's one. Two, they're getting all the interest. How about if I just, if you hold the note and you get the interest.

And right there, they were like, first off, can we even do that? I was like, that's the beauty of this. As long as we agree to it and we get a lawyer to paper it, we can do anything we want. As long as we all win on this deal. So of course they didn't just say, well, boom, you know, and shake my hand. They went and they talked about it for a week.

And I mean, like a week later, we put the final pieces all together at a [00:14:00] diner with ketchup stains on a piece of paper. Literally, I still have a picture of it. It's like all the terms handwritten on a page and a half. And, um, you know, we're, and we're like, all right, if we put this in there, put that in there.

And so we structured a deal, gave it to the lawyers and it came back, we're going to do this. And that's, that's how that happened. 

**Athena:** It's incredible. I have so many points. I hope y'all are making note, you know, because we're not just kind of glossing over some of these things, but the way that he approached it and how he went through this is really important.

Right. So Renan, if you were to guess how many times you met with the seller before you got to that point. How many meetings would you say you had? 

**Renan:** I would say about 7, 8 meetings where we would spend hours at a time. So, yeah, over a month and a half, 2 months. Yeah. It wasn't just like a brief meeting. It's we sat back and, you know, we were going to go to their P and L's.

Um, I wanted to know what some of these expenses were, you know, they were showing me how they could finesse some of the [00:15:00] money from the, the, the company to pay for spouse and kids and how they had their cards and how they were putting money in real estate inside projects because they had to show me what the ad backs were.

So there was a lot of relationship building there. So now I got to knew who the wives were, the kids were, you know, who my family was. Why are you going to leave corporate to do this? You know, and then it's. You know, are you going to get rid of everybody like private equity does? Do you want us to work it?

Or are you going to work it? So a lot of those conversations were had and it got to the point where they didn't want to sell it to anybody. But me, you know, that was the thing. It was like, you're not just somebody behind a computer in Connecticut at a private equity firm sending us a proposal. You're a real human being that we, we built a relationship with, so now let's try to make it work and it has bode well for the last two and a half years for a lot of reasons.

**Athena:** Right, we're going to dig into that in a second. Um, just on those seven to eight multi hour [00:16:00] meetings, were they all in person? 

**Renan:** Yes. 

**Athena:** Okay. Why do I do all of those in person versus I feel 

**Renan:** that's the best way to build a relationship. I mean, even I was talking to a company out in California and doing the same thing with them.

I was on a plane over there, California, Newport Beach on a fishing boat, structuring deals. I don't that's just me. Maybe that's old school, but that's the best way. The strongest way to do it. Can you do it over zoom or a phone call? Maybe, but it's that much stronger when you have the human connection. So, if you're serious about something, you're going to go meet a person and do the thing.

That's just how I. 

**Athena:** And I, I think it's important for people to pay attention to, right? Like, we want to get something to offer, like, within a meeting or 2, but, um, you know, when we're thinking about, like, a relationship, like, you date, you date, you date, you date, you know, and, like, you kind of get that vibe in person and it's the same thing with building relationships.

And if you [00:17:00] show someone like they pay attention, right? So if you're actually making the time out of your day to go and meet with them in person, not only do you have an opportunity to spend a lot more time with them and break down the walls that might come up in zoom because we're not able to just be humans with each other, but you're probably going to set the relationship up much better so that.

When it does come time to negotiating, when it does come time to choosing someone to work with, like they, they, what you said, they didn't want to sell to anyone but me. And I imagine if they had put this out to market, none of the other buyers would have made, you know, 14 to 21 hours of their time before even getting an offering.

**Renan:** And they had offers, they had offers from private equity. You know, because we're in an age now where everybody's cold calling, you know, these service based businesses. Everybody wants to buy them. So they. I'm getting calls. It's hilarious. It's I've been doing this two and a [00:18:00] half months and they're like, we're super interested.

I'm like, you don't even know who I am. Like, you know, it's just, you know, we love your business. We saw it online and we'd love to have a call to talk about buying your business. I'm like, it's, it's hilarious to be on this side of it, but that's what it is. And so for some people, it's a numbers game, but if you really want traction, you have to know what you want and go for it and talk to the people and, and really, yeah, yeah.

Build that relationship. 

**Athena:** So, um, I want to get into what happened next. But before we get there, if you can, without spoiling what comes. Yeah, 

**Renan:** I mean, there's no way. It's not that great of a story. It's a story, but I don't know. I feel like it's I think it's phenomenal, 

**Athena:** but. But I, I'd like sequentially, it just kind of helps us.

But if you were to look back, like now you have a couple years under your belt with this business and going through this process, so if you were to look back at how you handled those initial stages, would you have changed anything? Would you have done anything differently in the, in the lead up to [00:19:00] getting an offer inked?

**Renan:** No. No. I, I think it, it was done just right. It, it got us. Why did you say that? Yeah. I mean, I, I even quit my corporate job. Three days. I quit on a Wednesday before I, I signed on a Saturday. That's how I was just like ready to go, scariest three days of my life. I'm like, oh my God, what if this thing falls through?

What did I do? What am I doing? But yeah, it was, uh, yeah, on November, 2022, I guess. Yeah. 

**Athena:** So then you, you go through the process of actually buying this business. You're living the dream, right? 8 million dollar seller finance, 2 million EBITDA business. Tell us about day 1. What happened next? 

**Renan:** And then it gets even better or worse depending on how you think about it because I signed for it in November, but I had a little bit of a leeway.

I was officially going to take over January, but we signed for it in November. [00:20:00] So I had all of December to kind of decompress from corporate and just kind of be like, Okay, this is what I'm doing. This is, this is really happening. January 1 hits. And, um, that month I tested the theory of buying a business and having an operator and levels of management.

I went away for a week to Tahoe to ski with a group of people that invited me. I was like, you know what? Let's go did that and that month. We made a million dollars in restoration that you know, so it was like, holy shit. I'm sorry. Is this a clean pocket? I don't know. Yeah. Yeah. 

**Athena:** Yeah. Yeah. It costs all the time.

So, 

**Renan:** so I'm sitting down like, holy crap. We we're doing this. I'm out here skiing. Just living my life and. It's happening. And the first year, awesome. It was an awesome year. I mean, we made a ton of money. We did all the things. I put a lot back into the business. I put technology processes, we bought new vehicles.

I [00:21:00] mean, we, we, we moved in after 6 months, we, because they were operating out of like a house and I moved us to a professional building with a real warehouse. I mean, we are as legit as it comes. And, uh, the first year it was like. Yeah, it was, you know, I was, I was, it was just a really cool year. Um, and then, uh, do you have any questions about that, Athena, or just continue on?

**Athena:** Um, 1 of the stories, if you care to share, I don't know if you shared this on the podcast or not, but like. You know, first day in the office is the new owner and, and the team and . 

**Renan:** Oh, okay. So, so this was weird. All right, . So this, this was weird. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm, thank you for reminding me about that. We still joke about it to this day.

Uh, so I, I actually, um, as I was getting my MBA leading up to this, I remember that there, you know, there was a guy that was in construction because I don't know anything about restoration Construction. I'm, I'm cardiology, I'm medical, so I asked him if he wanted to do this, this. Thing [00:22:00] that we're going to take over this company.

And he did. So he quit his job as an accounting. He was construction accounting, but he knows the trades like the back of his hand. So him and his name is Nick. So Nick and I, we started day one. The owners never told the company that they were being bought, introduced us. I didn't know this at the time, but they introduced us as admin help.

So we're in the office and we're sitting down and I'm like getting social security numbers so I can get everybody benefits. And one of the VPs is like, I'm not giving you my social. Who are you? It was just the weirdest. So that right there, that's something I would have done different. I would have made sure that the entire company.

What was happening and you know, and all I guess, I mean, truth be told, I also showed up on the second day and they thought I was one of the, uh, the, the laborers that they pulled from Home Depot straight up. They looked at me. They're like, all right, come on guy. I'm like, I'm kind of like the new owner, but cool.

Whatever. Um, so transition. Of power needs to really be focused on, [00:23:00] um, luckily one of my, one of my strengths also is leadership being from the military for 12 years. So I rallied everybody up. We had a meeting. We told them what was going on. Um, and I told her, I said, like, I'm not going to pretend I know restoration that I know construction.

I don't know any of that. All right. You guys do. I don't, I know business. I know how to scale up. I know how we're going to win. I know leadership and I know, you know, how to negotiate and build networking relationships. Nick knows accounting and he knows construction, so he could be a person for that. And this is who we are.

We're going to come together and we're going to take this company to the next level. And everybody bought into it. It was a beautiful thing. Um, it was in two and a half, three months where the previous owners were gone and we had full control of the company. That's it. It wasn't that after we had that meeting, but initially, if I had to do that piece over again, very transparent on the transition of power.

**Athena:** Right. I was just so happy that I 

**Renan:** negotiated the deal and we were actually getting a [00:24:00] company. I totally missed the whole, you know, steps on taking over the, the, the business in the first place. But. 

**Athena:** So how would you would have planned for it knowing what you do now? What would you like? So all these folks are going to be buying businesses.

A lot are making offers or under offer. So when would you have started planning? What would you have planned for? 

**Renan:** Well, I would say two or three weeks prior to actually taking over the business, I would have sat with the and had a specific plan on, Who are we going to meet? Who are we going to roll it out to everybody?

I mean, we had the roles and responsibilities, but we would have had it like, once the paper was signed leading up, start having these 1 off meetings, setting expectations and having that transference of power. Instead of just showing up and then being like admin help. 

**Athena:** So, making sure you have a clear plan of action communications plan that you agree with the owners about, like, well, how are we going to tell everyone?

And what is this going to look like? 

**Renan:** Yeah, 

**Athena:** [00:25:00] um, and making sure that the key people are informed. So it's not just walking in and, like. Who are you? Why do you want my social security number? 

**Renan:** Here's another thing I want to touch on before I forget. Um, because one thing that I know is, is really pushed in a lot of these masterminds and groups and everything when they're talking about transition of power.

Um, they say, you know, talk to the previous owners and have them identify who the next general manager should be and all that stuff to a certain degree. Yes. Get their input, get their feedback, but ultimately it's your company, your vision and where you're going to take it. So you're going to put who you think.

It's going to be because if we put the who the person they thought was going to be, we ended up firing that guy 6 and a half months into it, not it's just he just didn't want to go along with our new processes or new technologies. He was good for them and what they were doing and he was their right hand guy.

And it's no harm, no foul. I love the guy still talk to him to this day. We still do business, but he could not have [00:26:00] the role that he had in that company anymore. He was getting paid a really good salary and he wasn't doing what we asked him to do. And he said it, he goes, I'm not going to learn these new systems.

That's just. I'm not computers. Well, we're kind of going there because for so, for example, they were doing about six and a half million dollars in revenue and what we do is we do restoration. So, you know, you get water leaks, fire, mold, whatever. It's kind of like a SurPro or Paul Davis. And for each job, they put it into like a green folder and they had green folder.

I have pictures of this green folders all over the floor and on the tables and everything. I'm like, what is all this? And they said, this is our filing system. This each represents a job. So somebody wanted to work on a job. They had to get the green folder, open it. And it was like Xerox. And they had to fill it out.

And so claims were taking months because it was, and if somebody couldn't find the green folder, it was just lost. So a lot of people would have been scared by that. But when I [00:27:00] was doing the diligence, I'm like, this is opportunity. If they're making six and a half million dollars with green folders, if we put everything on a centralized cloud system, you know, just so I saw that as opportunity.

And that's exactly what we did. First couple of months, I got all the managers together. I said, look, what's a good cloud based system for restoration? They all came up with one or two. There was a common theme, we vetted it out, and we ended up going with a system called Accelerate. So, from home, I'm home right now, I could get on Accelerate, I could get on Accelerate from my computer and see what's happening at the company.

It's a beautiful thing. I mean, it's, it's transitioned us until the digital age, um, but he didn't want to learn it. He didn't want to do it. He wanted the green folders. Well, guess what? We're not doing green folders. So, you know, you're going to have to leave because we're not going to pay you to not do what we're asking.

So, anyway, long story short. You don't take, you know, take their input, but ultimately it's your [00:28:00] vision for the company. And that's it. 

**Athena:** Yeah, it's, you know, you want to make sure there's a personality match that you get along with the owner, but also they got it to a certain point. Right? And you're the new energy.

And, um, Nash is actually going to come on next week and he's going to be talking about that too. Right? Like, the, the transition of the, you have good employees that were good with the previous owner owner had a certain way of working. Those people were used to it and. Some people don't like change, you know, some people don't want to go along with change.

So they might have been good before, as you said, but they might not be good for you. Um, so I don't know if this is appropriate time to talk about it because we haven't talked about what happened. First year was awesome. So actually take bring us up to speed what's happened since and then I might dig into different points on the timeline and ask you about those.

**Renan:** Yeah, so the first year was awesome. And then just to kind of. Add to this just to kind of give more [00:29:00] context. I had this idea of not only just buying a business, but setting up a private equity firm to build a conglomerate of businesses under 1 roof under 1 holding company. So that's why I was going out.

I was doing diligence on multiple companies. Um, I joined all kinds of investor clubs. I was doing marketing buying booths in New York City to try to really. And so I spent a lot of money on that. And, um, you know, we had a term sheet for 206M. Everything was just full steam ahead. We're going to put all this.

So I had at 1. 5 companies. We were going to put we had APA's drawn up for him all Barlow and, uh, and, you know, Bill Barlow. He's been he put together all these things. So he knows right? Um, and he's been awesome through this whole process, but, you know, it was an election year and then people got a little skittish for money and that term sheet for 206 million, it went away.

I'm like, all right, not a problem. We have other people that, that are, you know, are going to [00:30:00] invest and slowly, but surely everybody's got T Rex arms and they were like, I don't know if I'm going to invest. And we kind of put the cart before the horse. I was using a lot of the money from the company to also fund the private equity firm and employees.

And I had a C. O. O. a biz dev. I mean, I had a full C suite and I was finding it out of my pocket. Um, so I'm like, all right, cool. I mean, this is a strong company. It's going to do it's going to support all that barely, but it's going to support that. And then the second year, I don't know what happened, but all the restoration companies took like a 30 percent dip.

I mean, even the big ones in New Jersey, they, they were firing, they had to let people go because it just dried up. It was the weirdest thing. And I was like, okay, it can't stay this way for forever. And it just kept going and going and going. And I had severe panic and anxiety because this Juggernaut of a company all of a sudden was well, not all of a sudden.

It took a year and a half to almost [00:31:00] 2 years, but I saw it going out of business and it was very tough. And this is going to be a 2nd point. If you don't listen to anything else, I say this journey is tough. Have a good support system. You have no idea how important that's going to be. Because I got to the point where I thought I was gonna, and this person right here was one of the people I spoke to in person in Austin, when I was at my down, most down, it was, I've never, I've never been that way in my life.

Never had that. It was the weirdest, most irrational feeling I've ever had. But I felt like everything was just going down. I felt. I was gonna lose the house. I was, you know, kids weren't and all of it was going to just fall apart. I was gonna have to lay off 30 people. People, you know, these livelihoods depend on me and I'm letting everybody down and it's it's a real and if you hold that into [00:32:00] yourself, it's tough.

So you, it's so important to have that, that support system and like, for me, especially I wasn't reaching out. It's, it's Athena that reached and said, hey, what's going on with you? And I opened up because I went deep into myself, but it was a very, it was a dark, dark point for me. And that was like, what, 6 months ago, 7 months ago, maybe summer of last year.

Um, and then it was that 1 of those things. What do I do? Do I just fold up? Give up wave the white flag. Just whatever. Do I fight? And so I fought and I fought and I figured some stuff out. And so 1 thing I learned, it's easy to run a business when you have the money and it's doing whatever I learned how to run a business when you don't have the money when when things get tight.

What do you have to do to keep that business going? So, hey, we're still going. We changed the name, Syndicate Building Solutions. We're still going. That was part of it. It went from RestorePro to Syndicate Building [00:33:00] Solutions. We're on the uprise. One of the things I had to do to save everything that I have or whatever is, um, back in October, I went back to corporate America.

I'm a pacemaker rep again for Medtronic. Um, and it's kind of crazy because this is a job that a lot of people fight to get. You know, it's a it's a good paying job. It's a lot of people like, what the hell boohoo, you know, because it's a good salary, but that I have tasted what entrepreneurship is what it could be and I'm going to get back to it.

Don't get me wrong. I'm getting back to it. Um, but sometimes you have to take extra steps to get there and don't feel like a failure. If you have to. That's what I felt like I felt like, oh, you know, I'm supposed to be the poster boy for all this. Um. Yeah, so that I just support system is key. Have your people and have and check on your people.

If you know somebody that just bought a business and they're going through the first three or four months. Give them a call. And it's not, hey, are you crushing it? Because what if they're not, you know, just like, because they might not want to have to take [00:34:00] that phone call. Say, look, I'm just checking in on you.

You know, what are there any things that you're dealing with? Anything I can help you with? Because I guarantee you they are. Nobody takes over a business and everything is hunky dory. I've known plenty of people that buy a business and we are able to communicate because we've done it. And we're like, holy shit, oh my god, nobody says this part right here.

And I know it's glorified, you know, Cody talks about, oh, you know, you're not a business owner, so you're sitting there, how are you going to pay payroll? Yeah, that's a real feeling, but it goes deeper than that. It is, ugh, I can't even explain. And I've been there several times on how are we going to pay payroll, and I don't, it's amazing.

If you really want to, you'll find a way. It's the craziest dynamic and I was sitting with my business partner when I went at the end of called me the other day and we were saying how we defied the laws of economics that we're still it's it's but we're there we're there and we're doing this thing and we're going to have a good year this year and just to give a little [00:35:00] sneak peek at this we're actually in the running for 28 million in funding so we could pick up two of these businesses that we wanted so it's it's it was near but now it's starting to do this.

And now we can continue on with whatever we're doing. I'm sorry. I feel like I'm being long winded. I want to get to the questions and answers, whatever you got. It's all 

**Athena:** important. And, um, you know, your, your vulnerability and openness, you know, like, it's what every entrepreneur I know, like, feels, you know, and you're just good at sharing.

And it was, it was yeah. It was scary, you know, to like watch what you were going through and, and 

**Renan:** yeah, I got to the point where it was scary. It was 

**Athena:** scary because I knew I knew where your head was at, you know, and, and, um, what you said [00:36:00] about a support system. I think it's, it's so. Absolutely crucial, and I'm so glad you said it because entrepreneurship can be one of the most isolating things you will ever go through because people that aren't doing it, they don't understand.

And when you bought a business and people like, just assume it's all going well, and you don't want to let them down. Right. And then with your deal, especially you got made the poster boy of the biggest voice of business buying, right? So there's just so much enormity of pressure on top of your family, all of your employees and the seller themselves.

Right. And you were, you were carrying all the way to that and you felt the responsibility to all of that. And it was completely understandable where you were at. But it's like, man, in those moments, you really show yourself who you are as a person. Are you going to dig your heels in and fight? Right? And like.

You, you have those moments where you weren't [00:37:00] sure and, um, you know, but having those people around you that you're like, if you don't hear from me, I need you to check in on me and not not ask me if everything's going amazing and just see how I'm doing, right? Because it's like, if you're having a shit month and somebody's like, how's business?

You don't want to be like. I don't know how I'm gonna pay payroll this month. It's not like so you get those people around you that it's like it is not helpful for you to like celebrate the journey sometimes I just need you to check on me and and just be there and just let you know and it's like and and I I I was like You know, how you doing, you know, like, go for a walk, go, go roll and do jiu jitsu.

Like, you know, sometimes, you know, the things that will help somebody and it's like, they might not listen to you or not, but like, just having somebody be like, you know, and people do this with me to like, what can I do, like, go to the [00:38:00] gym, get a workout and like, I know I need that, you know, so, um. I guess it's all a rant to say my heart hurt for you and I didn't know what else to do apart from Just keep keep keeping in touch with you and letting you know I was thinking about you and pushing you to go for a walk or Go do jujitsu because I knew that was your thing and and just to keep going So like now 

**Renan:** here's the thing also, I mean, so I pushed and I'm luckily i'm making my way out But i'm telling you it's a reality though.

Sometimes companies go out of business all the time It's a reality. And that's something that you have to know going into this, something that you have to accept. And I also come from the world where people die, you know, cardiology, they die on the table where their last hope. And so, you know, I know people are out there and they're like, Oh, grandma will be okay.

We're thinking really hard, optimistic thoughts. Guess what? Sometimes it doesn't happen that way. Sometimes you have a bad ending. And so that's the thing that was in my mind. I'm like, this is gonna be one of those bad endings. This is gonna be, I mean, my house was up [00:39:00] for sale three months ago. I had people were in my house.

Looking and putting offers on and I had no, didn't know where we were going to go, where the kids were going to go to school and you could because I'm, you know, people like, oh, we're not, you have a strong resume, you could get a job anywhere. You know how scared corporate America is of a guy like me.

They're like, your story is crazy. You're, you're, you're not corporate, you know, and so I had to once again, that was another story on how I got a job with Medtronic again, but. I did. It stabilized me and now I'm still now I still have the business. So now this is where I win because now I'm gonna have the corporate job.

I'm going to have this awesome restoration company kicking ass and we're going to get funded and I'm going to get to do the pacemaker job because I truly love the patients and doing surgeries and doing all that. Not because I need the money, but because I want to. So this is going to be my fairy tale ending this year.

Hopefully, you know, but last year was a disaster for me, but it taught me. All [00:40:00] the lessons that I think I needed to learn. That's I, I really, I really do feel that, you know, um, yeah, 

**Athena:** when, I mean, you were staring down bankruptcy, not seller payments, having to sell your house that your four children live in, you know, it looked, it was, it was, and you told me the stat, like, just real quick, you, you said you need 30 jobs a month, 

**Renan:** Yeah, pay the 

**Athena:** bills, but you'd gotten how many and how many months 

**Renan:** we went through a period.

So we were doing 30, you know, averaging 30 or 40 jobs a month. And, uh, we average where we got 4 jobs in about 4 or 5 months. That's how bad the drought got. It just, it was, and we were like, when is it, is it gonna end? And then, you know, the bank account's going low 'cause we're, our payroll is like 60, 70,000 every two weeks.

Well, when you're paying that outta pocket, it's like, and nothing's coming in, you know, the receivables and [00:41:00] payables has, there has to be a balance there. So I saw all of this going down. You know, we, at one point we had 1.8 million in receivables and then we got down to like 400, 300,000 and we're like, that's going, we're gone.

We're gone in about a month. This is it. And so that's what we were staring on the barrel of. Um, another little PSA, we did get something called an MCA loan, Merchant Cash Advance Loan, the most loan sharkiest thing you could ever do in life. That was like super emergency type stuff. We knew we didn't know better.

We're still paying it off because interest. For a 550, 000 loan, we're probably going to end up paying over a million dollars. Right. So, but it got us through it. Did I learn how I could have done it better? Absolutely. But at the time I didn't know any better because I've never been in that position. So those are the things that I've learned.

Um, but if you could avoid an MCA. Just avoid an MCA debt, please, just, but we had [00:42:00] no recourse. So that was 1 way that we got out of, you know, going under not being able to pay payroll. Um, there's been a couple of other ways, but yeah. Yeah. 

**Athena:** So I, I, I might dig in and ask you to share those in a 2nd, but like, okay, you're, you're in that, that dark moment.

Like, what. How did you pull your socks up and decide to fight? And what made you even consider going back to your WTU? And then you talked about a fairytale ending. Going back to your WTU. That's most people's idea of like, that's the worst thing that can happen. So talk us through it. It is. 

**Renan:** And then that's the thing.

I mean, my brother, he's NYPD. You know, I kind of confided in him. And he came down and took all my guns. He was like, hey man. Until you're, you know, and I was at, when I was getting my house prepped for sale, you know, he came down because I just couldn't even do anything. I was like, literally shaking, anxious on the floor.

I couldn't, I couldn't do anything. I went to go see a doctor. They gave me a, [00:43:00] oh my God, Lexapro, I want to say. It didn't stop the anxiety. All it did was prevent me from feeling anything in the world because I'm generally a happy person. I like to joke. I couldn't feel happiness. I couldn't cry anymore. I didn't feel anything.

I didn't like it. I was like, this is nonsense. So I got off of that. Um, it was just a tough time. Um, and then it was like, what am I going to do? And it was, I have my business partner. I have people like you, I have people like Sylvie, And, uh, you know, I have the people that look, I mean, even Cody, we went for a walk and we talked about things and, you know, ultimately it's like, all right, look, file bankruptcy.

But did you die? Are you still alive to enjoy it? You have to reframe it. And you really, really have, cause I couldn't reframe it for myself. I needed to be reframed for me. So, once I had put into perspective, and then I kind of gave myself permission to say, okay, you know what, if the business goes out of business, it goes out of business because I was putting my own money into keeping it alive.[00:44:00] 

And a lot of the people, the entrepreneurs that I hang with, they were like, don't do that anymore. Business is this your personal make sure that you and your family take care of. And if the business has to go, the business has to go, you don't go with it. Your business and your personal is not interchangeable.

Um, so that was a big. Okay. So we did have to let some people go and we got leaned, but we had, that's when we found we had a lot of overhead. Still, the previous owners, they were making so much money. They were paying people just to do whatever. Right? So we got lean, we got efficient. Now we're at the point where, as we scale up with the same amount of people, our profit margins are just going to be ridiculous.

We're running so efficient and now we're doing like 40 or 50 jobs a month where we're, you know, we're getting it. And we're getting bigger jobs, different jobs. It, we're, we're a different company than what we bought. Um, I'm using my veteran status to, uh, you know, get into some contracts. We're we're. [00:45:00] It's, it's a beautiful thing of what's happening right now and we're seeing the perseverance come through, but there was a strong chance that we were still going to go under and there's still a chance where you're, you know, I'm not, I don't, I can't tell what's going to happen at the end of the year, but things are way more positive than it was last year.

We're doing, we're doing good. So 

**Athena:** what made you decide to get a W2 again? 

**Renan:** I had to, I had to, I, so in order to save the company, I pulled myself off the benefits. So I needed benefits. Right. That's a must for me. So yeah, going back corporate and having that stability, knowing that we're going to be okay, then I can focus on how is the company going to be okay?

That had to happen. And so I'm back corporate America. Matter of fact, right after this call, I got to go cover pacemaker implant at the hospital because we're going late tonight. So that's the things that make me angry because I'm like, man, I remember when my time was my time. If I did something in the evening, it's because I wanted to, because it was an investor meeting or [00:46:00] something.

Now it's like. I have to do it. I got to go, but 

**Athena:** that's why we didn't know whether, you know, I was telling everybody on Tuesday. I was like, we have a super secret guest and we're not going to know until day of. And this is, this is the reality, right? Like sometimes has to get pulled into surgeries. He works in the medical field again.

You know, we just didn't know what his schedule was going to be like. So really. I'm grateful that you were able to make the time and share all this. Um, you mentioned like, it was hard to go back to a W2. What did you have to do to convince them to 

**Renan:** work with you? So a lot of the people, I mean, so I started with Medtronic back in 2008.

That was my first corporate gig. And a lot of people that I was on the team with, they're still there. Like 20 plus years in the company. And so I told them and they've been following me on, you know, they know what I've been, and they're like, you know, rooting for me. They're like, so I had to eat a lot of the humble pie and go to them and say, look, all that Instagram bullshit and LinkedIn and all the stuff that I'm doing.

Yes. I got in some really cool rooms, met some really [00:47:00] cool people, did some really cool things. It's falling apart and I need a job guys. So they all came together and you know, made it is all like, once again, networking. It's the power of networking. That was, and that was ego, because before I went reached out to the Medtronic guys, I tried to get jobs like other companies and nobody wanted me.

It was like, you're you, no, you're a flight risk. As soon as you come on board, you're gone. You. So the guys at Medtronic that, you know, I pretty much have to tell them, look, you stick your neck out for me. I'm not going anywhere for three years. I'm going to give you three good years. I'm going to get the team straight.

So no matter, even if I get a hundred million in lotto tomorrow, I'm here for the next three years just because my integrity, I told him I'm going to do a thing. I'm going to do a thing. Um, but that's what it took. It took. And luckily I had that network. And so the manager here, he goes, I don't know who you are, but you got some heavy hitters vouching for you.

So yeah, we have an opportunity here. It's all yours. [00:48:00] And like I said, this is a job that a lot of people would really kill for in a lot of ways. So I have to be thankful for that. You know, I don't want to sound like, you know, a spoiled brat or just like I'm ungrateful. I'm very grateful to what I have in front of me.

So 

**Athena:** did getting a paycheck again, make you help you make decisions on the business in a different way? 

**Renan:** No, we're still, I mean, every Tuesday I have blocked off where I go to the, you know, we have our stand to meeting. I meet with all the VPs of the different divisions. We, we have strategy meetings there and we're figuring things out more from like 

**Athena:** a clarity.

Do you feel like you have better clarity and decision making ability because you're not worried about your mortgage payments? 

**Renan:** Oh, yes. Yes, but I don't know if I'm making different decisions, but I know I feel better. I do have better clarity. I don't have to force myself to think on what I need to [00:49:00] do.

It's just like, okay, well, think about this versus when I was going through it. I was just, it would take a lot longer to arrive at a conclusion because I was worried about so many other things. Absolutely. 

**Athena:** Okay, so something that you talked about is like when you want to find a way to make payroll you do and I cannot tell you all I don't I don't think most people here have actually like owned a business and had payroll before, but like that kind of accountability.

It's like nothing else in your life. Maybe apart from family. Right? And paying for your family. So you said there was a couple of different ways that you've made payroll. Um, you know, and partly it sounds like because of that amazing relationship that you've built with the seller. Do you want to, do you want to talk to us a little bit sharing what ended up happening there 

**Renan:** once it started happening with our jobs going down and the receivables going down and the payables going up?

Well, guess what? A big payable was that seller note. And so I had to talk to the [00:50:00] owners and say, hey, look, this is what's going on. We can't pay. What do you want to do? They're like, Oh, the business will come back up. Okay. Cause they, they've been doing it for 15, 20 years. They know. Okay. And it never picked up and we haven't paid them in probably eight, nine months now, and they actually come to the Tuesday meetings.

We're all coming together. To to, uh, resuscitate whatever is happening and it's a view. This is a beautiful thing. And this is pure transparency. They do not feel like we took the business. It sucked it dry. They know that we did our best under their guidance, and this is just, um, circumstance. And so we're all coming together to really.

Get this thing going, um, in a lot of ways. So if we would have taken a conventional loan or an SBA loan, we would have defaulted probably six months ago, or maybe we would have found it. Well, wait, I don't know. I would there's yeah, I don't, I don't know. I don't know what would have happened, [00:51:00] what resources would have been available at that point.

Um, but yeah, it's, they've been just awesome to deal with. And for me, the a hundred percent seller financing really allowed us to keep the business and. Not only keep it. So it's kind of crazy. Not only did we 100 percent seller finance, but in order to get us through some of the payroll things is they put another 300, 000 into it to give it CPR because they know they believe they believe in us.

They believe in the company. They believe in what this whole thing is. And sure enough, we're coming back up and this is something they never had to deal with because they always had that that cushion of money. You know, they didn't have a big seller note that they had to pay. It was their business that they built.

So they always had that just in case money that got them through that. So they're very bullish that we're going to get through it. And we are. And so they're like, Hey, here's another, and that was crazy to me. I'm like, not only are we not paying you, but now you're giving us another three. But that's, [00:52:00] that's where we are.

We even got to the point because now that we're two years into owning this thing, we could actually get SBA to refinance a portion. And they're like, no, don't do that. Because now they're going to be on second position. They're like, we will be, we're going to help you do this so that we can remain first position.

And then we'll just work out of this. I'm like, That's it. This is it. Yeah. 

**Athena:** I mean, it's incredible. They like to just rehash that, right? Like you stopped paying the seller eight months ago and instead of taking the business back, they're actually giving you money to help make it work and they're coming to your weekly meetings helping you figure out how to get it back on track.

**Renan:** They actually have another business that they have like a GC business or whatever. They hired a business development person on their payroll that we are going to use to do business development for us. So they're not even going to show up on our payroll on our salary. We're going to use their biz dev and [00:53:00] we're meeting that person next Tuesday.

So, I mean, this is all, we're very bullish of what's going on and it's, it feels good. I have, like I said, I haven't been able to talk like this in a long time because I haven't felt good. And so the only person I probably can do this for is Athena, right? Um, because I just did not feel like talking to anybody about this.

But here we are. 

**Athena:** Understandably, yeah. But I, I think it's. You know, you talk to anybody that's bought a business or that is a business owner and those dark nights of the soul are real. Right? And, like, especially when you're taking over a business and there's a transition, you know, hopefully no one, no one goes through what you went through, but there is going to be.

Issues with the transition and things that, you know, you're going to have to come up against. And even if you buy something that is highly profitable and has management in place, like yours, there are going to be problems when you take it over. So I'm, I'm curious if you, you did a lot of [00:54:00] things kind of early on, like you rebranded, you replaced a lot of capital expenditures.

Like, um, it sounds like you made changes maybe in the first 90 days, which some people say that you don't. So knowing what you do now and two years into it, would you have. Change things or done things differently or slowed down. Some of the changes. Are you still happy with exactly how you did it? 

**Renan:** We think we talk about that every other day.

My business partner and I, what could we have done differently? What did we do? Right? What did we do wrong? A lot of the upgrades that we did, we would never change like a big thing. Cost was moving from a 3, 000 a month, uh, rent place to an 11, 000 a month professional commercial building. But because we did that, that got us into a bigger, um, network.

So we joined a network that you could only be part of if you're truly a commercial restoration, not like a mom and pop truck with a truck type deal. So we professionalized the heck out of ourselves. The [00:55:00] rebranding, we had to do it because we're going on a national level. So there was a lot of the things, all right.

There's one thing that we wouldn't have done. And we talk about it. You know, we put like almost a hundred grand down to sponsor the Philadelphia of freaking Eagles and get on the, um, the, the radio and do commercials. What was the ROI on that? I don't know. I mean, it was cool that people were like, Hey man, we heard you on WIP with the official and I'm a giants fan.

So that hurt me especially to be on an Eagles radio. But Sequan Barkley. But anyway, um, but that's something it's like, did we really need to do that? But all we saw was like we had all this money coming in, and so, all right, a hundred thousand dollars, that doesn't account for all the other stuff, right? So I would've not built out my private equity team the way I did, right?

Because I had all kinds of overhead on something that wasn't generating revenue. But we had a term sheet. We had all these things. So I was like, Oh, we're going to be okay. I'm going to front load this now. And then when we get the capital in, we're going to be [00:56:00] fine. You do not have the money until you have the money and the check has cleared.

And then even wait a week after that and then you have the money because I actually had somebody invest about half a million and it was a fake check. So that was that was the whole other thing. Yeah. So that's the life I was living. You know, I was like, I was, I was, but a lot of it was business development.

Like, I was going to these big and like Fort Lauderdale, you know, big investor meetings, you know, you have like Jeff Hoffman, Mitzi Perdue, you know, Mark Cuban at these meetings. And so you have to pay to play. You get in there. I had a booth. We looked as legit and official as, as, you know, because I come from corporate, I know what it's supposed to look like.

So I put money in. I wouldn't have done that. Um, and I toss with that because if I didn't do it, I wouldn't know a lot of this stuff. I know now I wouldn't meet a lot of the relationships I have now. So that's the toss up. I would have been more careful and just a little bit more. Um, I wouldn't have done as much because I was doing like all the things, you know, to, to drive the [00:57:00] business I would have done really try to see what maximize my ROI and but I didn't know, you don't know until you start doing things.

I'm like, well, that didn't work. And now we know. And so we just my business partner and I just had this conversation yesterday. When we get funded because we will get funded, we're going to be so smart with that money and we're going to put it in the right places. We're going to acquire these businesses that we want to buy and we're almost thankful that we had the year that we had because it taught us a lot and that I don't know.

I don't regret anything to be honest. I don't like that. I went through what I went through, but I don't regret it. It's just part of the story. Learn from it. You either win or you learn. You don't lose like jiu jitsu, right? You win. I learned,

**Athena:** um, so I was going to ask you if you thought, you know, in hindsight was the private equity play. So early on [00:58:00] a distraction. 

**Renan:** Oh, yeah. 100 percent for me. Absolutely. And so I took my eye off the ball there. I was taking Nick with me to a lot of these meetings. We were putting together. You know, all these, uh, investor decks and, you know, proformas and everything, and we kind of left the business to fend for itself, which is it can, but we felt once we took our eye off of that.

That's when things kind of started falling. And once we really got laser focused on it, like, we're like, we're not going to get funded for get private equity. We're going to concentrate on this that it took about six months, but that's what we kind of willed it to. Let's go. And so we got on, um, like, preferred status for USA for NJM, which is a local insurance for New Jersey.

So, we got on that. So those are the things that are kicking that really are helping us. Um, once we got laser focus back on this, and so now, now that we have the 28Million dollar play back in, we're kind of nervous. We're like. We don't want to take our eye off the ball again to [00:59:00] chase that, but we're doing it responsibly.

And this is that's the lesson that we learned. So, 

**Athena:** so, you know, I think it's a thought, right? When people are like, I want to get a manager in place. Like, you, you had managers in place and it was going well, right? But, like, you weren't there being involved with the management and they will never 

**Renan:** operate.

Unless they have equity piece in it, unless you're, you're incentivizing them, like really, really incentivizing them. They do not have the, and that's, I kind of knew that, but my business partner, because he's younger than me. And so he was like, Oh yeah, we have manager, blah, blah, blah. Nobody's going to take care of that business.

Like the owners will nobody, nobody. So you have to keep your eye on the ball. 

**Athena:** Right. I guess, I guess it's to the payroll point, right? Like it doesn't have to be 40 hours 

**Renan:** a week. But like, like for me, I dedicate Tuesday mornings, I go there with the meetings and it's radically, [01:00:00] I take phone calls and I make decisions throughout the week.

That's it. And we're, we're doing well, so, and I'm the strategy guy, nothing happens unless, you know, so, 

**Athena:** and, but you, how, how, how involved is your business partner? Is he 100 percent on it? 

**Renan:** Oh, yeah, 

**Athena:** yeah, 

**Renan:** so I 

**Athena:** guess it's like, who stands. Who's going to be up at night, like, who's going to lose sleep if payroll is not paid.

**Renan:** Oh, we both still do. We both still do. But 

**Athena:** just for people to think about with putting management in place. The managers aren't going to lose sleep if payroll's not paid, right? Like, it's, it's you. It's the owner. And it's, that, that is the risk. And where it gets me nervous when people are like, I'm going to put a management order in place.

Um, you know, there's or like, not really having oversight of the things that are happening and how important that is. So there's somebody we both know, um, who's about to default on their [01:01:00] SBA loan payments because they thought sales was beneath them and they put it onto the text. While they were running off to London and stuff like that, you know, so it's like,

I know you were having problems with a salesperson at one point. How did you navigate that? How did you guys get back on track? You, I mean, you were slowed down to literally a halt in terms of the number of jobs that you needed. What did you actually put in place to write that? Me, 

**Renan:** I got in there. I was, you know, I, myself and my business partner, we had to get back to it.

And really get out there, go to the Chamber of Commerce meetings. You know, I tried BNI and I hate BNI with such a passion. I'm sorry if anybody likes it, but I do not like BNI. What is 

**Athena:** BNII, I don't know if I'm familiar with that. 

**Renan:** We'll talk about that. Well, I, we can talk about it now. It's like, it's an organization, it's like a weekly meeting and it's business owners or small business [01:02:00] representatives, and you have like a one hour meeting, a designated time every week and it's, you're supposed to support each other from a business perspective.

But I, I just, yeah, we can talk about it, but I'm not a big fan of being. I, I really do like the chamber of commerce. I think there's good. If you get into a good chamber, that's a great way to make business connections and just use your network, you know, your strengths. So, for me, you know, I joined, like, the veteran chambers.

Also, I'm part of the Princeton chamber Burlington chamber. I'm getting my company is a preferred restoration for 4 dicks in New Jersey. So that's me, personal, and what my strengths are, so you just have to figure out who's in your network, who can you tap on, and, you know, who could open doors for you. 

**Athena:** And, to be perfectly 

**Renan:** honest, the company's supposed to have a book of business that you're buying.

That's been the biggest thing, and that's how I justify not paying. I'm like, hey man, this is supposed to be doing 6 to 7 million every year. Where is it? And, oh, it's not that, [01:03:00] well, I, we can't pay you, because the book of business that we bought And so that's why we're all coming together to get that book of business jumping again, because they they're even confused.

They're like, we have no idea what's going on. So let's figure it out. That's all, 

**Athena:** but ultimately the revenue in the business and the responsibility of that falls to the business owner and like, And so then I, I just, I can't pull it out enough because a lot of people don't necessarily have sales experience, but like chief revenue officer owner, you know, regardless of there's an operator in place and like, you will, you will find the ways to find it and figure it out when it's on you and your livelihoods at stake.

And 

**Renan:** if you're not sales, find somebody who is sales. That's the thing. And so for me, and I mean, that sales has been my whole whatever. So I'm, I'm pretty good at it, so I went out there and, you know, [01:04:00] did the thing. Um, yeah. 

**Athena:** So one of the, one of the things with doing 100 percent seller finance, I don't think anybody's going to be making that play here.

But I guess the importance of a line of credit and when to get a line of credit. Yes. 

**Renan:** So, another huge lesson learned. When, you know, there's two types of, uh, acquisitions, you have your APA and then you have your stock purchase SPA, right? Difference there, asset purchase agreement, it's, you buy the business, so you're buying the assets, but you're not taking on the liability.

So that's why everybody kind of likes that, because, you know, if they killed somebody 15 years ago, you actually own that liability. It could come back to haunt you. Um, so people think APA is the cleanest way versus a stock purchase agreement where basically you're just taking on the same EIN, same everything, but now you also have any liability that they may have had over the last 20, 30 years.

Um, we did APA and we couldn't get a line of credit for anything [01:05:00] because all the banks and financial institutions view you as a brand new company, even if the company has been around 20 years. You are a brand new company, so that's why I'm like, we just made the 2 year mark back in January. So now we can start doing all these lines of credits and refinancing because we're official now, but that's for APA.

You have the stock purchase agreement, but there's a 3rd thing that Bill Barlow actually figured out for us is called the F REORG. It takes the best components of an APA and a stock purchase agreement. So you get to keep the EIN, but it's almost like an asset purchase. And it's and that's what we were going to do with all the other entities.

We're going to do something called the F reorg. So you have to be very, and I didn't hear about it in all the masterminds and all the meetings. Nobody talks about F reorg or, you know, everybody's like doing APA, APA, APA, APA, APA. No, sometimes it makes sense to do a stock purchase agreement, even if you're not going to do an F reorg stock purchase agreement, if you want to have line of credit power.[01:06:00] 

Borrowing power, things like that. Consider strongly. There's nothing wrong with the stock purchase agreement. You just have to do a little bit extra diligence, legal diligence to make sure you're getting a good company that there's nothing hidden, 

**Athena:** right? And there's, you know, you're not going to be able to depreciate.

Yeah, so that's the thing. So, with APA, there's 

**Renan:** goodwill that you can decrease. So we're depreciating like 7. 6 million or something. So, yeah, our taxes look really nice. You know, and we got a pretty good refund. Yeah. 

**Athena:** I think the point there is make sure you have advisors around you that can. You know, like your legal advisors, your financial advisors, like using people that do these deals all day long that can advise you on the different ways that you can do that and structure that depending it's so dependent on the deal.

So we want to go in and like, we want an asset purchase, you know, but in some instances, it makes sense not to do that. I think I just saw Lindsay's. But they, they had 1 of those situations when you have, you know, for [01:07:00] example, like, the contracts won't survive. Or you have a bunch of people. Or assets or things that is just going to be a nightmare to try to transfer all of that over.

Can't transfer the contracts or, you know, in your instance, so typically if you're going to get an SBA loan, they're also going to build in a line of credit, but it's one of those really important things to get that when you are doing your SBA loans to make sure like you're getting as much of a line of credit as you possibly can built into that loan because once, once you start, once you need it and you haven't negotiated that up front and the business isn't doing well, you can't get it.

That's it. 

**Renan:** That truer words have never been spoken. That's it. When you need it, they're not going to give it. They'll give it to you all day. If you're doing well, they'll be like, Hey, we'll give you a million dollars on your credit. Uh, we don't need it, right? Get it, take it, run with it and just put it aside for a rainy day.

Truly. Yeah. 

**Athena:** Um, so one of the funny conversations we had, uh, you know, and the things we [01:08:00] don't necessarily get in the places that we should when we're paying for masterminds or courses or whatever, um, capital. Like maintenance CapEx, capital expenditures and what that means in a deal, you, you ended up being okay on that front.

Um, but it was something you weren't necessarily aware of going into it. 

**Renan:** Yeah, because we, we figured it's making so much, we just reinvest, reinvest, reinvest. And, you know, we didn't consider taking the, as much of a dip. And then, like I said, we also spent money outside of the company for the private equity firm, so.

A lot of that. It's just the point being just get line of credit and make sure you have the working capital at least six months of working capital, like if no money comes in the door to pay payroll and just all your overhead for six months until you could get. And if you can't get your ship right in six months, then you have a bigger problem, you know.

Yeah, 

**Athena:** good lessons. Um, folks, if you have any questions for her, non [01:09:00] specifically start putting up your hands. I always, I always talk to Mike, but also I want to make sure there's no silence. So, um, I'm going to ask a few more questions, but if you, you know, you get open line of communication with him, if there's any burning questions, he is an open book.

And that's something that I love about him is he doesn't hide anything and he gives you the real truth. But Renan, you know, most people are buying businesses to get out of their W2. You're back in a W2. Like, do you regret going through this? Would you do things differently? Or do you think it was worth it?

**Renan:** I, I, I would quit in a heartbeat if I didn't commit to these guys that I'd be here for 3 years. Yeah, it's just because like I said, I know, I know what I can do in the entrepreneurship world and what I would like to do. I want to be better than corporate. That's, that's part of my mission. I want to get back to community and be better than corporate.

I want to, you know, I'm still going to do the private equity firm. The firm still is still alive. It's myself and Nick now, right? Um, and we [01:10:00] still have the business development guy that's ready to come over when we take the California company, but yeah, I do it again in a heartbeat. It's still it's scary.

It's the scariest thing ever. Um, I don't think I would have learned as much if I was still doing my W because some people ask me that all that. That's a common question. You know, can I buy a business and still do my W2? Yeah, but then you don't get to learn a lot about the business you just bought if you're doing your W2 unless it's something that that's in line with what you do already.

Like, if. If it's something you are very familiar with for the last 20 years, let's say your, your father was HVAC and you did HVAC as a kid and, you know, whatever, and you're used to it, cool, then, then, you know about it, but I had to immerse myself in the day to day and kind of see, um, and that's another thing that's funny when people are like, Oh, I saw, you know, there's a business.

This guy's had it for 30 years. He says he only does 6 hours a week on it. Okay. He does six hours a week because he spent the last 30 years doing [01:11:00] like 80 hour work weeks to get to that point. You don't know anything about that business. You're going to have to spend some time to get to know it and then you could maybe trim down.

So it took now because of circumstance, two years later, I'm like, I'm saying I'm dedicating half a day to it and my evenings, you know, phone calls, I still do some biz dev stuff, but yeah, I wouldn't would not have learned that business if I was still W2. 

**Athena:** Well, and you don't regret buying the business, I guess was my question, right?

No, 

**Renan:** absolutely not. No, it's still there. And everything that 

**Athena:** you've gone through, as scary as it is, What I don't want to see is people are like, Oh my god, this is so scary, I don't want to buy a business, you 

**Renan:** know? No, it's scary, but it comes with a risk, just like anything else. I mean, hell, I could get fired from my corporate job tomorrow.

Should I be scared of having a corporate job? No, just do the best that you can with it. Just know the rules of engagement. Know what you're getting into. Don't take things for granted. If you do it the best of your, [01:12:00] you know, best to your ability, you have, I mean, we have the opportunity to turn this into a 15, 20 million a year business in one location and then add all these other things on, you know, I mean, I'm 49 by the time I'm 55, this might be a totally different conversation.

Like, oh, this is the guy that turned it into a 500 million operation, blah, blah, blah, blah, that's how I think. So you can't do that unless you have the business to begin with. I'm not going to do that working my W 2 job. I had to buy the business in order to get into that conversation. 

**Athena:** Right, and buying the business, it's a bet on yourself.

So, you know, like, things, things, if you plan for things going wrong, but you believe I'm going to do Absolutely everything I can to fight my way out of it, then you, you are in control. I think a lot of people are so afraid of entrepreneurship and the not knowing what's going to happen. And it's like, things are going to go wrong, right?

It's going to, 

**Renan:** it's going to. Yeah. 

**Athena:** But like, do you believe in yourself to, to fight through that? Will you [01:13:00] fight through it when it, when it takes it, you know, and like I said, there's no level of accountability, like having payroll. 

**Renan:** Um, 

**Athena:** Joe, I see your hand up. Uh, what's your question for Ranaan? 

**Joe:** Thanks, Athena.

Hey, Ranaan. First of all, thank you for sharing your story. Uh, the, the very high ups and the low downs there for you, man. Um, but from one Action Academy member or former Action Academy member to another. Um, I know you were with the group over a year ago, and I wouldn't be here if you hadn't recommended, uh, Athena and AquaMatch.

So, it was probably a year ago, you and I, we either traded a message or a phone call, that sort of thing. You gave a couple of suggestions, and, uh, so it seems to be, it's working out, and, uh, what I'm under LOI, trying to get a second LOI. And, um, getting things rolling finally. So I do have actual questions [01:14:00] for you based on the business when you went into.

What the 100 percent seller note is what you had explained, right? So explain a little bit more and how. What turned the sellers on to that? And were they greedy in the way of, let's say, an interest rate? Were there any, you know, crazy customized specifics that they needed? Or was it pretty straightforward in the way of the terms and the numbers?

No, it's, it's very, they 

**Renan:** were very reasonable because not, so here's another thing I, I also say, I talk a lot about the, well, people ask me a lot about the 100 percent seller finance, but what I don't talk a lot about are the 30 that didn't get off the floor. There were a ton that I tried this tactic. I'm like, oh, and they were like, get out of here or they wanted too much.

You have to have your parameters and stick with it. Don't give into really ridiculous terms just because you want to buy a business. I've known people to do that. They just want a business so bad, they'll do [01:15:00] whatever. And they think I'll just make it work. Don't do that. Have the discipline like blackjack.

You know, you hold on this and you hit on that. So have your so for these people that that's why I built the excel spreadsheet. What we did is we were able to change the interest rate. We were able to change the term, the years of the loan. And so, um, by plugging that in, we got to see what was good for us.

Uh, for me and good for them. And we, we landed on 7% interest rate. And like I said at the time, the reason that we landed on that Yeah. Is 'cause I, I was conceding that to them. I was like, look, I actually have A-A-S-B-A loan with six point a quarter percent for a dry cleaner, so this is the going rate. I'm willing to give you 7%.

And they were like, oh, okay. And then we also, uh, uh, I conceded on multiple because on biz buy, sell, a restoration company goes anywhere from 3.5 to four x. You know, I'm sorry, 2. 5 to 3. 5, I gave them a 4x [01:16:00] multiple on their ebita. And so I gave them a higher multiple and a higher interest rate. The numbers still worked.

And so we're like, this is a win for everybody. And they took it. They will, this is, let's go. 

**Joe:** That's good. That you gave a real industry or company comparisons, uh, made it seem like they're getting a good deal, right? Yeah. You have to educate them and you, yeah, that's it. So was it just as important? I think you had said that you showed them what they'd be making over.

The term, right? And it was way above their selling price, right? Or asking price. So, okay, simple tactics. Uh, I'd like to just have those in my pocket. Try that more often with any sellers. Um, know them the numbers plus what the lenders is. It's just so high. Yeah, I mean, 

**Renan:** you should show them. Let me see. Well, 

**Athena:** we have the simple calculator or not actually, um, built the first version of that and [01:17:00] we've added to it.

So, um, in the bottom of your all's. Financial modeling is like, you can show them in 10 years what it looks like, but we can also give you access to the simple calculator. So, like, what you don't want to do is show what your profit and take home is because the seller will be like, what, what, what, but like.

So what we're not did, and this is what I really want to pull out is the education of the seller. So it was months of this relationship before he even had this seller financing conversation, and he was educating them throughout every part of the process, because I don't imagine the seller even understood what a multiple was, or EBITDA, or how businesses are valued, or, you know, And at the time, the interest rates were much lower.

So he was showing them the interest rate that he was going to get, which at the time was 6. 25 on a business loan. Now it's more like 10%. So, um, but we're not educated. He educated. He educated. He [01:18:00] educated. He was sitting with them and getting them comfortable with how these things work, et cetera, et cetera.

And when he tells the story of how they arrived at it, he was actually showing them how he bankrupt the business if the interest rate went too high. You know, can I show, 

**Renan:** uh, can I 

**Athena:** share here? 

**Renan:** Because I actually put, I haven't pulled this freaking calculator up in forever. And I'm like, I'm blowing dust off of this thing.

**Athena:** We're not, we're not causing his dumb calculator. And I think it's a genius calculator. Um, I think Anka can give you share access there. 

**Renan:** All right. So basically what we did, everybody can see that. The scenario one thing here. Yeah. All right. And this is where I put interest rate and years. So right off the bat, I was like, all right, guys, um, you know, six and a quarter, let's go 7%.

So that's the first thing we negotiated 7%. I said, how good would it be if I could pay you back in like three years? Right? So the way this goes down to is this is the net profit. This is the asking price, [01:19:00] you know, financing. So this is the full amount that's financed. And then this is the payment right over here.

And then this is what it nets out to be after debt service. So it clears a million dollars using these numbers. So at 7%, I said, what happens if I pay you back in like five years? So we put that in and look at what it clears 99, 000 that's literally the number that came up and and the owner himself was like, there is zero way I am going to sell you this business and you're only going to pull 100, 000 in profit.

That is not fair to you. I would that I wouldn't make me comfortable at night. That's how I knew I had a good person that I was, I was dealing with because they knew that they were making 2 million dollars and to sell a business where I'm only going to be pulling 100. That's wrong. I'm like, Oh, I'm so glad just because I would have never agreed to that anyway, but I put that in front of him.

I'm like, all right, let's put it out to 20 years. He goes, well, I don't want to be on the hook for 20 years. Well, let's see what happens. So I put it out to 20 years. We're at 1. 2. We're like, all right, let's trim that down. So we went back and forth, 8 years, whatever. We [01:20:00] landed at 12 years. We're still clearing over a million dollars and I showed him here that for 8 million plus the 3.

8 in interest. amortized over 12 years, he's really going to be making 11. 8 million. That right there is what sold. This is the thing that sold him. He was like, holy cow. So you're getting that. He goes, can you put anything down? I'm like, no, I can't. He goes, what? I'm just trying to, you know, I'm taking a risk.

What do I get for my risk? You're getting 3. 8 million for your risk. That's what you're getting. You're getting the interest payments because you're holding the note. So that's, that's really the talk track. And then from there, this is where I've, you know, I have all the other companies. I have Reliance, Marsh Creek, that I did the same thing.

And these are things that are under LOI. I have my venture fund economics. I mean, this was, we were, we had a big, a big thing going on here. But, um, anyway. This was, this is my dumb calculator that I built a private equity firm [01:21:00] off of and it's actually going to work. That's the thing. That's the craziest part.

Um, it's actually going to get off the floor and we're going to do this. But so for now, in today's economics. This is how I would flip the script and these are the conversations I'm having back then I conceded 7 percent interest because six and a half now you build a relationship, build a relationship.

They want to sell to Joe Joe. I really want to sell this to you. Now, Joe comes back after a month and a half of building this relationship was like, you know, man, I really, you know, I want this business. They're like, yeah, Joe, we know what you want this business. I'm having a real tough time with the bank, this 10 percent interest, you know, the, the numbers, whatever the asking price.

They're just, I don't know if they're going to approve it. Well, what are we going to do? Do you have anybody else? Because I'm telling you for a fact. And I talked to Bill Barlow, who is like the attorney, MNA attorney. He has tons of people buying businesses as well. Probably 20 percent are actually closing because they [01:22:00] are having trouble getting approved for a loan.

So using that talk track, I went to some of the other companies. And so that's, I got more part of seller financing built in with the other companies. They still want a down payment, right? So that's what I'm getting private money to do. But a good majority is being seller financed because. Nobody's getting approved for loans these days.

It's tough. And the interest rates are through the roof. You use that tactic, you're going to get a lot more seller financing than you think. Not 100%, but you could probably get a good 50, 60, even 70 percent seller financing. If you could come in with 25 percent down, and now you're in the game. Because the interest, use the interest rates to your advantage.

And the fear of them being locked into that. So I don't, I'm not saying, you know, gloom and doom, but now they're staring down the barrel. They're 65, 70 years old. They want to get rid of this business. They want to sell it, go off to the sunset. Nobody's buying because nobody's getting approved. But hell, if I just [01:23:00] come up with some good terms with Joe, I could sell it to them.

I'm going to get payment. And now I could just go off and retire and live my life. They just want to get rid of their business. You know, so if you have to find the right buyer, but that's the talk track that I'm going with and it's working like people are buying into it. 

**Athena:** I think it's like, there's something to be said for what you said earlier to about making you the only like, if you develop the right relationship well, before you get in this car, and you get to the point where you're the only person that they want to sell to, then this opens the door.

And I think what most people get wrong is they talk structuring. Too early on before that seller sees you as the only logical person to take over their business. 

**Renan:** I have a company in California that we want to acquire them for 18 million. Obviously we're having trouble coming up with the money. Half of it, I have 50 percent seller finance.

And the only reason is because it's two partners and one of them wants to get bought out all the way. He wants nothing to do with [01:24:00] seller finance. The one that's staying on is more than happy to finance his portion. So I need to come up with nine mil. They're going through some stuff. We've been talking to them for a year and a half.

And I talked to them maybe once every two weeks. And they're like, we still want to do the deal with you because we know what you're about. We know how it's going to be beneficial in the long run for everybody. They still have private equity coming, knocking on their door. And I still have them on the hook somehow.

It's the craziest thing. It's because I flew over there. I went there multiple times. We did a 10 hour fishing trip, structuring a deal on the boat. I'm seasick. I hate being on a boat, but that's what I did because they love fishing. Anyway, those are the things that you have to do. 

**Athena:** Love it. Joe, are you good?

I want to grab Andrew's question before or not has to run off. Yeah, go for it. 

**Joe:** Yep. Thank you. It's here.

**Andrew:** Hey, 

**Renan:** Andrew, go ahead. 

**Andrew:** Yeah. Hey, 1st off, thank you very much for sharing. I'm kind of similar [01:25:00] to Joe. I wasn't in that community, but that. Podcast was a pretty big anchor for me, and definitely the 1st time I'd ever heard Athena's name. So, um, which is this whole process has been the most has taken my trajectory and shrunk that timeframe quite a bit.

So, I owe a lot of that to you and the energy and honestly, the transparency that you brought to this process, both here today, then honestly, in the podcast and things of that nature as well. Uh, the, the question, I guess, you know, that seemed like, is there historical evidence behind why the business had that quick of a turnoff?

Was that, is there something deeper there within the insurance industry where they're not paying out? What, what was, that seems really took both parties by storm and that just seems like such an anomaly. Um. Yeah. And I just kind of curious if you guys have yet to uncover that, or if you've gotten any closer to what the [01:26:00] solution was there.

**Renan:** So, it's part of the normal ebb and flow of that industry because for that for restoration, they don't go by quarters. They go by years. They have their up years and down years. So we hit a down year cycle and we thought this might have been another down year, but where we're starting to come up a lot of the natural disasters that are happening around the country, California, Florida, you see what's happening with insurance.

They're pulling out of the states. They don't want to pay deductibles are going up. So customers are now having to make the decision of a 5 that they had a 2000 dollar deductible. And so it's easier to pay that and get your house fixed versus now it's like a 10, 000 deductible and they're like, I'll just do this myself.

So they're not calling the company. So all the companies are suffering for that. So we had to evolve as a company. And so we got more commercial facing. So we paired up with big construction companies and we're doing work with the construction companies, post construction cleanup. Um, you know, we're doing [01:27:00] warranty work for like Lenar.

And so it's a big home building, uh, natural. And, um, You know, so they have, like, all these communities. We did a one and a half million dollar mold remediation in their entire community. Like, they had mold rampant. They, they called us in. That's the kind of stuff that we've evolved to. And that's where we're, yeah, where we're excelling in.

And then now all of a sudden we're getting the residential calls again. And so it's like, all right, we're getting the commercial stuff. The residential stuff is picking up. We're going to turn on a couple of more things and then we're just going to take the, it's, we figured out how you have to evolve. If you stay the same, you're going to die.

So you have to figure out exactly what you said. What's happening in the market. How do I take it to the next level? And for me, I don't have a restoration. So I, I leaned on the guys who did, who sold me the company and they were like, it's, it was as much of a mystery to them. That's, that was the craziest part.

So it was like, so we're kind of all in this together. Cause I'm like, Hey, guess what guys, if our company, this company goes out of business, that [01:28:00] 8. 6 million, whatever, that's gone for everybody. We've lost the business and you've lost the payment, you know, and that's it. So yeah, we're, we're banding together and it's, it's working.

But yeah, 

**Andrew:** that's awesome. 

**Renan:** I hope I answered the question. You 

**Andrew:** did. You did it. The only other thing I was gonna say real quick, Athena, just for the sake, obviously, like I said, the vulnerability we're on. Thank you so much for sharing that. And as like a casual bystander to your story, um, that the down the valleys, um, has been just as encouraging because, you know, it's kind of like a don't meet your heroes thing.

Like, I'm super thankful to hear that story. Not thankfully. so much. Through it, but thankful to know that it's not all shiny roses that you hear online and be on forums. And it's good to hear the downside too, because that's a reality that we all have to come to terms with. So thanks for the vulnerability.

I appreciate it. 

**Renan:** Don't be afraid to have a big vision either. And because after I did that acquiring mines, you know, I know I had a big vision. I know how crazy it sounds [01:29:00] to have a 206 million term sheet and get all this money and buy all these businesses so quickly. I know how crazy that sounds, but that was our reality and I'm sharing it.

I got so much hate from that, and not so much, I would say 50 50. Some people, you know what I'm saying, go for it, go for it, and other people are like, dude, you're wackadoo, you're crazy, you're gonna fail, you're gonna Cool, you know what, and I'm out of the frame of mind, no, you would fail if you were to try this.

I'm gonna do this. And so you have to be strong for that. Um, have the vision. If you could see it, go for it. That's all I can say. You know, yeah, don't, I don't care about what other people think, you know, um, but I 

**Athena:** think that's a beautiful way to kind of frame it out. And Andrew, thanks for saying that, because it is, it is.

You know, taking what was a very harrowing journey and putting it into a positive, you know, and, and like I said about Renan, like, none of you would be here if it were not for Renan inspiring me to swing big, [01:30:00] because it was, it was after hearing his story that I went after my 8 million Deal where I raise money and those investors became my very first clients.

Right. And, and I wouldn't have even had them going after something. Had I not heard a story, how do you not inspired? Well, it's 

**Renan:** because of Athena that I even got on acquiring minds in the first place. And it's not like I was trying to get on quarter miles. It's like, it just. She made the ninja and I'm glad I did because I got to meet some really cool people through that podcast also.

So that's what I'm saying. It's the experiences that you go through, learn from everything. You either win or you learn. That's it. There is no losing. 

**Athena:** But another thing I want to point out about Ranaan is like he swings big. He has a big vision. But oh, my God, this man is selfless and his heart is so big and he brings people up and shouts people out so like you can have an amazing, big, crazy vision and also just inspire the hell out of people and do this with [01:31:00] heart and, and that's what makes us want to rally around you.

And so everybody here has amazing hearts and good integrity and you can do business and you can win. Being that way, so, like, if anything, this should encourage you that, like, when you do the right things and you are a good person and you have a big vision and you're willing to bet on yourself and you're going to fight your way out of anything that comes up, you know, there is a happy ending.

And I love that you started that off with, you know, it's like. I'm having my happily ever after you're in a W2, you bought a business, you're buying some other businesses. It wasn't at all what you thought it was going to be, 

**Renan:** but 

**Athena:** where you ended up is something you're grateful for and you've learned from and, and other people now can learn from that.

So I, I know we were taking you out of your W2 and we didn't even know if you could be here, but this is how much of an amazing person you are, that you're willing to take your time out and share. Really important life lessons and business lessons with, you know, all the [01:32:00] battle says that 

**Renan:** now I have calluses and scars to prove it, you know, speak from experience.

Now, you know, that's that's that. I think that's a strong thing. I couldn't imagine this 2 years ago being able to speak like this and I'm glad I'm kind of glad I went through the stuff and I'm sure I'm going to go through more stuff as the years go. But. Here we are. 

**Athena:** Yeah. But you only get to speak for experience when you take your shot, you know?

So That's right. Like we all get really scared about what this could all mean or what happens when we buy the business or what if we didn't see that thing. But you don't get the experience if you don't take your shot. So you know, you taking your shots and talking about it and being open and vulnerable about the real true experiences.

Hopefully inspiring everybody here to take a shot. 'cause I know you did. With me and I continue to take shots because of you, um, inspiring me that, that I can dream bigger and I can do things that I didn't, I didn't know I could raise 3 million in five days. Like that was insane, you know, [01:33:00] like, but it was the only way I was going to keep the deal.

Um, so, you know, thank you for inspiring us. Thank you for taking your time out to be here. Thank you for being so. Open and vulnerable about the realities of things and I might see if I can try to convince you to come back at some point and just do a deep dive on seller relationships and selling and how you I mean, what you did is exceptional and you see it as normal.

But, you know, 

**Renan:** 1 of the funniest things that happened and it was that contrarian thinking. I did a sidebar thing for Cody. She had me speak on that. And so one of the guys, I had like 30 people show up at my station and one of the guys came out gun slinging. He goes, I believe you did seller financing.

There's no freaking way I would have never done that. Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. And then I'm like, look, first of all, why are you coming in so hot? Second of all, why, why would you not sell a finance? If you had a business, why wouldn't you sell a finance? And so I had them list some of the reasons I'm like, well, if.

I addressed some of those reasons. Could it be a conversation like, [01:34:00] let's say I did this and then the guy literally paused. I'm like, well, I'm like, look at this. I've been only talking to you for 30 seconds. I already got you considering seller finance. Don't tell me it's not possible. And everybody's like, but that's it.

You address the fears. You address the concerns. You don't come in with your own agenda. This is what I'm trying to accomplish. How can we accomplish this together? How can I address your fears? Your concerns? Make sure you. And as long as you come up with, you know, a good thing, you'll be all right. But yeah, we can do that.

I can do that. Yeah. 

**Athena:** I love it. Thank you, Renan. Honestly, this has been phenomenal. I, I think everybody hopefully enjoyed it as much as I did. Um, but Renan and I can and have talked for like nine hours straight about deals. Like I could. Pull into so much more and ask you so much more, but I know you do have to go and go to surgery tonight.

So, um, thank you. Uh, this was exceptional. I really appreciate your [01:35:00] time and honesty. Um, and hopefully I can wrangle you to come back and, and share some of that secret sauce about how amazing you are at, at building relationships and win wins. And I don't even want to call it sales, but the, you know, like the way that you are able to, to, to.

Help people see the win win and working with you in ways maybe that they didn't think of initially to be able to get things done is is exceptional. Um, so thank you again. Appreciate you and we need to find a way to get back in person again at some point. Yeah, this is the year. Awesome. Well, thank you all.

Uh, thank you. Renan. Have a great rest of your evening and we'll see you all next week. Nash is going to be here next Thursday. Renan actually knows Nash and was there through the initial transition and stuff too. So he's got an equally phenomenal story and insights into how he took over his 6 million.

Uh, auto repair business and he's a year and a half into it. So he's going to be sharing all the nitty gritty for what he's gone through to, [01:36:00] um, not as nearly as harrowing, but my God is he had some incredible things happening. So, uh, that'll be next Thursday too. Thank you so much for non. We'll see you all later.

Have a great rest of your day. 

**Renan:** Bye.
