# AcquiMatch Buyers Club 01/21/2025

[00:00:00] 



**Ryan:** Hey, everybody.

**Gil:** Hello. Hello. 

**Ryan:** Hey, Polly. Just, thanks for growing into this call. I just got off a call with Polly, Gil, Andrew. Welcome in, guys. Hey, hey. And Justin, special guest today. Justin, how are you doing? 

**Justin:** Doing good. Yeah, I found some time, so I figured I'd jump on. 

**Ryan:** Oh, man. I'm excited. Great. Oh, perfect. Justin's got a lot of things.

I've been wanting to ask him. So glad we got him on the call today. Chris, how's it going

doing? Well, cool. So today, um, [00:01:00] I wanted to touch on a few weeks ago, or maybe maybe it's maybe it's over a month or so ago. We discussed. Buyer seller relationships, and today I'd kind of like to build on that conversation specifically towards the off market 1st on market conversations. We have a good amount of people right now, they're involved in both or off market.

And those conversations are a little bit different, and we have some people that are getting close to submitting some allies on some off market businesses, and it's a bit of a rodeo to get there. It's a lot different from the on market process. So, uh, wanted to kind of discuss the difference in those 2 processes.

I think a lot of us could take a lot away from that and, uh, open up to anyone to share their experiences as well and just talk through. Uh, what you guys are working on at the [00:02:00] moment, maybe some hurdles you're running into with, uh, on market sellers and off market sellers. And, um, and then, yeah, I'd love to also just kind of, I'll kind of start off here and kind of my thoughts, and then I'd love to just jump into some actual scenarios that you guys are going through.

Justin, I'd love for you to maybe share, because yours is a very unique position. Also, kind of where you're at in the process right now is it's developed from just making an intro to, you know, you're now trying to get it across the finish line. So I think you have a lot to share there. Um, but I'll just start off by saying that.

You know, in the past, I worked primarily, uh, getting sellers to list on market. Uh, so some of those sellers that I worked with, they either came to us because they had heard of our brokers before and they were interested in getting a valuation and interested in the possibility of getting listed on our marketplace, [00:03:00] or we had done an outreach to them and contacted them and wanted to learn more about their business and see if they might be a good fit.

So, so my experience and what I did is I, I focused a lot of building relationships with people who want to sell their business. And kind of had to walk like the tightrope of building that relationship and also getting them to accept the valuation that they'd be happy selling their business for. Right at a brokerage, if we're going to list the business, there's a lot of work we have to do to work with the seller to get them listed.

Right. And if they want to list for an extraordinary listing price, well, then we're just wasting our time. Right so there's this, there's this balance of working with a seller who wants to sell and getting them to a reasonable multiple when you're getting listed. Um, some brokers, they want the business so bad.

They'll let the seller just pick his price and you will find that [00:04:00] sometimes when you look at multiples, it's a little bit higher. Maybe the business is that good that the, uh, that they listed that high because the broker really wants their business, or maybe it's just the broker needs business and he doesn't have a lot going on.

So he just gave the seller the price of the old floor. So, when I was working at a brokerage, um, I was walking this line of, I tried to get everybody on the marketplace at a reasonable price that I thought, We could get a transaction and a lot of that comes with just how you start the conversation and engage, uh, the person selling.

So. When someone's not listed yet, and that's that's going to that's going to be the profile for an off market seller. Someone who's not listed. Uh, Gil, uh, he'll be, you know, we're going to be working on scheduling him with an off market. Um, start hopefully this week, um, just in the, the, the business that I've been referencing [00:05:00] to that's an off market seller as well.

So, uh, with the off market, something I want to touch on right now, is Jason on the call today? Jason's on. 

**Jason:** I'm here. Just got here late. Awesome. 

**Ryan:** Jason's also, um, really getting close with an off market opportunity. So I'd love, um, Jason, if you're open to sharing some of your experiences as well on the call.

Um, there's a lot of, uh, there's a lot of discussions I had with sellers to try to get them on the market. And I, I put a valuation together for, which is just like, this is what I think your business will sell for and what you need to be open to to selling your business for. I've seen people say, let's go immediately.

And I've seen people go back and forth with me for months about what that price would be. Um, and I've seen people. [00:06:00] This business is so out of line. 

There you 

**Ryan:** go, I've seen people want a price so out of line that I literally had to say I don't think that's gonna be a fit For us at this time. It's just I don't see buyers paying that they'll go silent for three six months And then they'll come back and they'll say let's go with what you got.

So A lot of this is part of, uh, the education process of when I'm speaking with a seller, educating on them. What's a reasonable multiple? What's a reasonable price for a business like yours? And this is the first time they're having this conversation. So, someone like Gil's business, Justin's business, uh, Jason's business that they're all working currently, uh, there's an educational piece that you kind of, uh, you have to treat it a little bit differently.

You have to build the relationships a little bit more. Um, [00:07:00] actually, I'm sorry to go off a little bit. Andrew also, uh, we're speaking with someone who's he doesn't have a broker representing him. Um, so it's a similar situation, um, but, um, the difference is, but the on market, they have a broker, the brokers already told them everything to expect.

Maybe they have 5 interested parties. So the relationship piece is a little bit less important. Not that it's not important. It's just not as. Critical as the off market. Um, so I just kind of want to. Start that with the discussion and maybe just start off by saying, you know, Justin, can you share your experience?

Tell him a little bit about. The business that you're interested in right now and kind of talk through. Maybe start where I made the handoff to you of. Of the seller and how you kind of started building that [00:08:00] relationship and started building that conversation. 

**Justin:** So, uh, you guys had reached out to me about the off market deal here.

I'm in, I'm in the Northeast, New York, New Jersey area. Um, it was a business owner that wasn't currently looking to sell. You just had reached out, I guess, cold email, whatever it was, uh, got on the phone with them and he really. Thought about it and considered, Hey, maybe, maybe it is time to sell. Um, I jumped on the phone with them and introduce myself, told him what I was looking for.

Uh, so we kind of just created a relationship there, uh, invited him out to lunch, um, got to know him as a person, get to know his business. Um, so he's the sole owner of a, uh, landscaping business. He does irrigation, pesticide application, those types of things. Um, we started this conversation in October, I think, maybe, [00:09:00] maybe September.

I would say October. Um, it is now January 21st. We're still, we're still talking back and forth. Uh, but we've been working on an APA for probably over a month now. Um, so yeah, creating the relationship with the sellers, especially, uh, if it's off market is absolutely key. Uh, you, you can't go anywhere without having some type of rapport with them.

Uh, especially cause they don't have a broker on their side. Uh, especially if they're not already looking to sell you. Like you mentioned, there is a lot of educating them on, you know, what that purchase price may look like, uh, what comes along with the business. You don't get to keep the vehicles, um, you know, those types of things.

Um, so it's just a constant, uh, back and forth and educating them on how the process works. And that's been, it's been fun. It's definitely completely different than when you have [00:10:00] someone that's on market with a broker in the corner, um, telling them. Things that may or may not be true or, um, you know, um, match with the market may say your business is worth or what you should do with it.

So, yeah. 

**Ryan:** How would you say, how would you say your relationship is with the seller today? 

**Justin:** Oh, I can call 'em, I can text 'em. Um, right now we're at the stage where now that turn both of our attorneys are doing their lawyer thing. So the lawyer, your attorney, their attorney, they're obviously gonna look in.

You know, for the best interests of their client. Um, so me and him on the same page and then him and his lawyer on the same page, me and my Laura on the same page, kind of, uh, for both of us, I should say, um, so it was just trying to get the, all the legal out of the way. I know they're looking to protect us in each and every way.

I mean, me and the seller are just like, let's get this thing done. And, um, you know, if anything arises, [00:11:00] we'll, we'll take care of it as you know. Person to person. So, uh, yeah, 

**Ryan:** absolutely. So when that's a good. That's an interesting point. Okay. So the lawyers are talking when was at what point did he get a lawyer involved?

So you first had the conversation there was there was no lawyer involved. It was just an introduction. At what point did he say? Hey, I'm gonna need a lawyer. 

**Justin:** So I told him about the concept of an LOI. I told him hey, this is just gonna be a document that says I'm interested in your business. Uh, And that documents can outline all the following steps.

Um, he reached out to an attorney and I'm pretty sure it's just his, his family, a business attorney, whatever it is, they aren't well versed in M and a, which is a downside. Um, and something that I've learned is very important. Um, having your seller have a, an attorney that's well versed in an M [00:12:00] and a, but, um, I actually, I want to 

**Ryan:** pause it.

Why do you think that's important? 

**Justin:** Because there are a lot of things in there, uh, that his attorney thinks is Correct. Um, for, for example, um, you know, they didn't, they didn't understand or didn't agree with like reps and warranties. They, they believe that the seller should be compensated for his time during transition, uh, at a pretty high price.

Um, and there's a couple other things in there that just, uh, if, if you were talking to a business broker or a business, um, or MNA attorney, they'd be like, yeah, that's, that's just standard practice to have a, B and C in this, uh, contract. So fighting those battles, but we're, we're working through, it's a little bit slower than what I anticipated, but, um, learning day by day.

**Ryan:** Okay. Gotcha. So, so the [00:13:00] first thing was you. When you sent when you introduced the did you submit the yellow first and then he asked questions or did you explain kind of what was to him and kind of 

**Justin:** yeah. So, educated them on it's going to, you know, identify purchase price is going to say allocation of equity.

If you're going to be given equity to maybe an existing employee, you know, along with the business. Uh, purchase becomes or comes along all the assets of the name, the vehicles, all those types of things, uh, just, just whatever your typical says, right? Um, I told him that's what it was going to be. Gave it to him.

I had it signed. I signed it obviously. Uh, and that's when he got in contact with his attorney and, uh, They wanted to go straight to an APA, which was totally fine. Um, in this case, it's off market. Um, I wanted the business, [00:14:00] um, business made sense for me. So we skipped ahead to the APA. But, um, hindsight 2020, the attorney is not well versed in M& A.

So, uh, we just have rough drafts going back and forth. So a bunch of red lines and things like that. Um, yeah. That's why that's when they got introduced. 

**Ryan:** Okay. So, okay. So, uh, having them in a lawyer, as you can see. What Justin's referencing to here can make a huge difference. Uh, you know, they're, they're outlining or talking about things that should be standing practice standard practice, like a transitional time.

And, uh, 1, another 1, I'm seeing come up right now. Actually, a deal with me and Jason are working on is working capital. I don't know what about working capital just ended. 

**Justin:** I'm going to, um, I'm not taking any accounts [00:15:00] receivable or anything like that. I'm just going to bring my own cash to the table. Um, 1 thing I'm just going to have, like, an example here, like, they redlined, um.

They wanted me to pay the, the tax sales tax on, on a business, which is not standard practice, um, uh, just, they wanted a hard sell date, um, like it's going to be the state or, or, um, you forfeit your deposit, those types of things, just, just a bunch of things that, uh, you know, just a well versed MNA attorney would be like, yeah, that's just not how that works.

Um, so. 

**Ryan:** Is there anything you think that could have been done? Like you said, hindsight is 20 20. Is there anything you think that could have been different in that submission of the LOI, or like, educational piece that could have, you could have prevented some of the back and forth you're going through now?[00:16:00] 

**Justin:** Um, I guess there's two different things. I probably would have pushed LOI just because. It's not like I understand his side of it. It's like why go through the non binding LOI? Let's go straight to the APA. I understood why he wanted to do that. We both wanted he wanted to sell it. I wanted to buy it.

Let's go skip straight to the chase. So I say I would have pushed harder for the LOI because I would have kicked off a lot of different parts of the process like due diligence, legal, And financial due diligence. I would have kicked that off a lot sooner, but, uh, through the back and forth, there were times where like, oh, maybe this is not going to close.

So I'm not going to start, uh, financial due diligence. I'm not going to have the lender, um, start running credit and, and, you know, putting the deal together. So, um, yeah, I, I guess, uh, on the second part of that is I probably would have had my attorney, uh, I would have pushed for my [00:17:00] attorney to draft the APA.

Um, they were insistent that his attorney do it. So we kind of conceded to that. Um, both me and my attorney now know that we, we probably would have, we sh we should have pushed a little bit on, um, on my attorney drafting the APA. Um, well, we conceded to him. He's a seller off market. The only, That his attorney is the only person he has in his corner.

Um, so kind of just to make him feel better about the whole process. We kind of gave in there. 

**Ryan:** So, that's interesting, like, you're coming to the table with the 1st offer, which is the right. But then ultimately, somehow him and his lawyer for whatever they discuss, they end up drafting. What should be your offer?

**Justin:** Well, yeah, yeah, essentially. So they, they boiler plated it, did whatever. I don't know if she wrote from scratch or she chat GBT did. I have no [00:18:00] idea. Uh, but yeah, it, it cost me a little bit more than I would have liked just because of all the red lines and all the revisions and all those things. But, um, yeah, I mean, let's learn.

**Ryan:** Yeah, so, so, yeah, 1 of the things that kind of, I guess, that's that's interesting here is just kind of about before you get started with the yellow. I, um, there's, you know. Building that relationship with the seller can go a long way. It sounds like you guys are texting back and forth. You have a pretty good relationship, which will be good and important during a transition.

Can you talk about how did you get there? How did you get to that? Like, kind of comfort level. Uh, with the seller, uh, what we're, you know. What do you what you got you guys to that relationship? 

**Justin:** I think it's just a constant open lines of communication. Like, I, I don't have, uh, I don't believe he's told me anything, [00:19:00] uh, untrue.

Um. You know, I know him as a person. I know he has a family, his daughters, his sons. I know he has a house in Florida. He's there now cause he escapes, uh, the winter in, in New York. Um, just having those conversations, I think we've talked on the weekend, uh, like Sunday morning, like several times already between, uh, when we first.

Um, when you first handed him off to me, uh, to now, so just building that rapport, whether, uh, mostly we set up the calls to talk about business and talk about, um, you know, what he's looking for, what I'm looking for, those types of things. Um. What is just a slow over over time kind of relationship that develops 

**Ryan:** is it when you guys talk like you said Sunday mornings?

Is that like an agreed upon time? Where you guys like, let's kind of check base once a week or 

**Justin:** no, it's just as [00:20:00] need as needed. Right? Um. Again, like I mentioned before, like the lawyers are doing their lawyer thing and I kind of I told like this happened recently. I think I talked to him this past Sunday.

Um, I was like, let's me and you talk and let's hash out whatever we disagree on. And then just tell lawyers. They can write it in their legal terms and then we'll just sign it. Um, but, um, yeah, usually if we set up a call, it's to understand, you know, what his revenue cycles look like or, um, talk about his team members, um, what he sees, how he wants the business to, uh, succeed over time, uh, post transition, just, uh, just add basically anything we think of, really.

**Ryan:** Nice. Um, I remember you talking about maybe playing golf with them. Did you guys [00:21:00] ever get to that? 

**Justin:** No, we ran out of, we ran out of good weather up here. I mean, maybe, maybe when, when the spring hits, um, we should be like, I just talked to Leonard this morning. I think realistically, um, a closing could be in mid March.

Um, so, you know, we go through the transition. We continue to grow the business. Maybe we go off on a Friday. It usually takes Fridays off anyway. So we go off on a Friday, play around the golf, catch up. Yeah. 

**Ryan:** Okay. Nice. So, so then, yeah, I guess just, I mean, that's awesome that you're where you are. The off market opportunities are challenging for these things that we're talking about.

Now, you know, lawyers, no broker. Uh, building that rapport so that they feel comfortable, you know, when we started the conversation with him, he wasn't shopping his business. It just started with [00:22:00] fielding an opportunity. Um, so to get them to where you are now. Uh, that's really awesome. Anything would you be open?

Anybody maybe have any questions for Justin? Why he's up here? Just. Open up about an experience. Anybody have any. Questions? I know, Andrew. Andrew's got a question. Andrew, yeah, go ahead.

**Andrew:** Yeah, hey, Justin, thanks for, thanks for sharing, man. I, you know, it's such an interesting dance, especially when you're Or it seems like, and you've shared, that's the case that when you're dealing directly with a seller, I mean, when you were kind of walking into that struggle that I've been having in regard to, you know, if we were to come across the same situation would be, you know, what if me and that sellers personality don't exactly click right?

And how can you develop a rapport with somebody? Who's literally the polar opposite of you and garner a kind of trust that you've obviously built with him where you [00:23:00] guys can kind of have a, uh, a no BS kind of a conversation. Um, can you kind of speak to how you were, you know, I don't know if you guys personalities matched or not, but I'd be curious your takes.

I mean, you've got obviously you guys are talking and your attorneys are battling behind the scenes. So you guys both know that that's happening. Right. And how that, you know, how that relationship kind of played out and how you approached it. Maybe you just, you know, I don't know, just kind of curious your thoughts.

**Justin:** Yeah, I would say our personalities are, are pretty aligned. Um, so I can't really speak to having a battle, you know, someone polar opposite. Um, if I were, I would try to get a sense of the culture in the business. Because one, the transition is probably going to be a little bit tougher. I would imagine if you guys are just clashing a little bit.

And then like, how is he taking care of his team? Um, how do they feel about him? Maybe, maybe it's a really good thing that you step in. Uh, or [00:24:00] maybe they're just Totally checked out. I don't know. Uh, just, that's just something that pops into my mind when I think about that. So luckily I didn't have to deal too much, um, with that.

Uh, what was your second part of the question you asked about? 

**Andrew:** Oh, I mean, you, you kind of answered it. I mean, it's, it's, I guess it was just more of a genuine concern. You know, just looking at the personality measures and like, when, like you said, he didn't really have anybody in his corner. I mean, it seems like the 1st conversation you have with anybody who doesn't have representation, their arms are up, like, they're against the wall and you're, you're pinning him to the wall and that relationship and how that kind of gets launched.

Is uh, they're they're totally uh showing you their world and yeah, it's just a it's a finicky relationship And it's just a really interesting I really appreciate you sharing because that's unique approach. It doesn't happen all the time but it seems like your answer too is Great, because if you if [00:25:00] you don't match the likelihood of that business meshing with you is probably pretty slim too, you know Probably in most cases so that is just most of it 

**Justin:** Yeah, I was, that's just pops in my mind is like, what's the, what's their team like if he's, if he's like this, like who wants to work for this guy, but I don't know.

That's kind of like my pessimistic side. Sometimes it's the best of me. Um, yeah, it's just building that rapport. I just try to be super genuine. Like you mentioned, you know, this guy's opening his door and his books to you. He has no one in his corner. You got someone probing him with financial quote. Like this is, this is his sacred stuff, right?

The business he's, he's been in business for 26 years. Um, he's got some random. Stranger poking around his business. So just being open, honest, genuine, um, And really show an interest in in the business, right? Like I really want to grow this family grown business that has his last name in it. [00:26:00] Um, And, you know, I, I made it clear that I, I need to keep the name and I need to grow the business and continue that, that legacy, um, for his sake, for my sake, you know, I got, you know, a house or my family riding on it, whatever it is, um, you know, it has to be successful.

**Ryan:** Awesome. And, um, yeah, sometimes just, I mean, build on that a little bit, Andrew, sometimes it just takes more than one call. Right. So that first call, even if maybe you just don't, don't connect on that first call, just following up, just setting up a second call to build more rapport will kind of give them a little bit more confidence.

Right. So, you know, Justin was saying, like, all right, you're just some stranger. And so the whole time they can look at you that way. But then after that 1st call, he said, hey, how's it going? Love to jump on a 2nd call, have another discussion. It's like, okay, this now it's, you're not as much as a stranger and, and you're showing some genuine interest.

Okay. Now, let me feel that 2nd [00:27:00] call. So, it may take some time. Um, you know, you don't have to blow it out the water on the 1st call and just become best friends, but just. Just kind of just try to connect with them, try to build that relationship and then have that continue to a 2nd call. If you like the business, unless you get a completely gut feeling for the 1st car.

No, this isn't going to be someone I'm going to work with. That's 1 thing. But, um, I don't think you need to be super reliant on that 1st call. It's it's definitely a process. I think, 

**Justin:** yeah, our 1st call was all introductory. I mean, he maybe gave me a super high level of the business, but the, the goal, the first call was to get to know each other, uh, and then set up a second meeting, like in-person meeting, uh, if it's possible, if you're local, um, then to understand the business.

But it, the, the first call is me getting know him, super high level of the business, and then for him to know who I am and what I bring to the table, my background. That was, [00:28:00] that was my goal out of the first call. And that was it.

**Ryan:** Jason, I see you got a question. Go ahead. Jump in. Jason. 

**Jason:** Yeah, my question, you know, I have a similar kind of off market deal. And, um, the report has been good. And, you know, I think when Ryan and I had the initial conversation, he was like, how do I turn video on on zoom? I was like, okay, we're going to have to meet in person.

So, you know, that's kind of what I've continued to do. You know, as, as we've, you know. Text back and forth. Uh, I usually try to meet him in person. Uh, and I think he has really appreciated me kind of coming to his office every time. To have conversations and that has really has build our rapport, you know, small things like found out his kids and myself with the [00:29:00] same schools.

Like, we grew up in the same areas. Same same as I did. So, the report is there. I think some of it is a lack of. My understanding of this process, just cause I've never done it before and he's off market. So he's never done it before. So, you know, as we're going through conversations of like structuring the deal and, uh, talking about AR and, uh, one of the biggest point of contention for us right now is working capital, uh, where he's not really willing to, uh, provide any type of working capital from the business.

Basically everything in the bank account is his, uh, but, you know, I've got a good example of. You know, what working capital is, it helped me understand it, right? It's the analogy of the gas in the car. So, you know, I even use that analogy with them, right? You're selling a car and then siphon out the gas.

And then take it with you. Um, and he essentially said, uh, yes, [00:30:00] correct. Uh, so, uh, I, I'm just curious, you know, Justin, if you have any thoughts about how to approach that, or, you know, is it worth continuing to have a conversation around working capital? Cause I feel like it's honestly our last hurdle to get over before I think we have a, a deal structured.

**Justin:** Yeah. Um, In terms of working capital, specifically, obviously, yeah, I mean, you cannot operate without working capital, and if you don't have it in the bank, then you need to, um, either try to get some from the seller, or you can potentially finance it through SBA, um, or get it through the SBA, you will be charged interest.

But, um. If I, if I try to get it from the seller, like if I needed to get even a little bit, a portion of it from the seller, I I'd kind of, and I don't know if this will work [00:31:00] because I haven't had to do it, but I would just try to get them to understand having to go through this process again, either with another Seller that's somehow finds them off market, or they have to go through the whole song and dance with a broker.

And then they also have to give up a percentage of their sale to set broker. Um, so kind of like shorten in the process, like I can get this deal done. I like, I want this business. I can get this deal done. I just need help with working capital. Now, what that arrangement looks like. I I'm not a. But I'd kind of try to see if you can kind of get on the concede on just a little bit.

Um, again, you can get it to SBA if you need it to. I don't know if it's still cash flows. Um, but that's kind of the approach I would take. Um, like, I try to go in, At a lower purchase price on my on my business knowing that he wasn't gonna have to pay a broker Uh, he didn't really go for it. [00:32:00] Um, he he was flattered but um, he didn't really go for it So I kind of conceded there but um, 

**Jason:** yeah that that's kind of the situation i'm in where T's of the opinion that you know, people have approached him before and he hasn't sold he's he's in he's in no Position where he needs to sell right now.

**Justin:** Got it Yeah, maybe, maybe your only way is to, are you going through SBA? Is that how you plan to find out? Yeah, I mean, 

**Jason:** that's the plan. Uh, I just am trying to continue to reiterate that if you don't include working capital, the price of the business is going up because, you know, I'm going to have to ask for it.

Well, it's like I have the money, but I rather not, you know, to me, I'm trying to get him to the point to understand like part, like working capital is part of the business. It doesn't operate without it. 

**Justin:** Right. Yeah. That's a tough, tough conversation to have. 

**Jason:** Uh, yeah. We've continued to have it in multiple different ways and just [00:33:00] hasn't made that much traction.

So, uh, we're gonna have a, a final conversation here. Oh. Hopefully it's the final one tomorrow. 

**Justin:** Yeah. Let's know, 

**Ryan:** did you, uh, I'm curious, Justin, in terms of where you got to in terms of purchase price mm-hmm . Was there a lot of back and forth there in terms on, on the purchase price? 

**Justin:** Well, I kind of, so I originally told him what my lender was willing to lend.

And I guess they, they kind of low balled it too. So I told him, yeah, I can give you X, X amount of dollars. And he was Very appreciative, flattered. He never thought he can sell his business for X amount of money. Um, but then he started talking about equipment and said, well, equipment's worth X amount of dollars.

So I gave him a bunch of scenarios. I gave him straight SBA. I gave him SBA with seller financing. I even tried to pitch 100, a hundred [00:34:00] percent seller financing. Um, and the only reason why I did that is because he. He takes home a decent amount of money every year. And honestly, if he just held onto the business for several years, he'd make what he's about to make on the sale of his business on, and he's working Monday through Thursday, half days off Friday and is off.

November, December, January, February. So he, he works like nine months or was that eight months, eight, nine months out of the year, let's say. Um, so I try to pitch the a hundred percent seller financing. Um, so he came back to me with the, with the equipment, um, value and all those types of things. I had to educate them, you know, without the equipment, there's no business.

Um, For S and G's, I went back to the lender and they're like, yeah, we can, we can meet him at this price, which, um, so I said, Hey, here it is a hundred percent. Uh, SBA Finance, you don't have to do anything. Let's just get it done. If you would have asked me a couple months [00:35:00] ago, um, I would have told you this would have been closed.

But, um, it's still gonna close. We're, we're still alright. 

**Ryan:** Well, I mean, I think that's a, an interesting, like, tactic is. To come with the multiple offers. Like just give them options so they have something. 

**Justin:** Sure. I think I give 'em four, 

**Ryan:** four options all at one time. Not like one. Here's one offer, here's the second.

All one 

**Justin:** class. All at one. All of 'em had a little bit of advantage on both sides. Right. Um, but I was really hoping you would go for the seller financ. He did not 

**Ryan:** the financing ultimately, did he select, did he select one or did he Dr. Like, did he mark one up? Of one of those that choose to go with that. 

**Justin:** Um, I think he just straight took one of them I'm, pretty sure that's what happened.

I just like let's just go with this one. I was like, all right, okay Let's go. Let's go. Yeah, 

**Jason:** I would say I I did something similar I gave them three options, but then you know, he took the options and he just marked it all [00:36:00] up, right? So it's like Not even the same option I provided. Right. So then we're kind of taking a couple steps back because, you know, the way he's structuring the deal.

Um, you know, this is the education piece, right? He's asking for a higher interest rate on the seller node. He wants to amortize over like 3, 4 years, right? He's a, he's a boomer, right? So he's like amortized over 8 years. He's like, I'm, I might not be here in eight years. Like, you know, I'm trying to get paid now.

Like these are the things I'm kind of up against. 

**Justin:** You just always have the SBA be the bad guy there. Just be like, Hey, these are SBA guidelines. I, I can't really do too much wiggling. Um, and just let them be the, Fall guy.

**Ryan:** Yeah. Um, that was awesome. Uh, yeah, Jason does, he's, he's kind of firing all weapons [00:37:00] or all missiles at this, at this seller. The seller is kind of stuck on this price and, uh, it does feel like he's a little bit, um, he wants to challenge everything to kind of make sure he's not being taken advantage of. Uh, it feels like a little bit that like, that's why he's challenging everything.

Um, because something like a simple as like a seller note. He's kind of marking it up to the point where it's, there is no point of taking a seller. Now, if, if he's going to change, like, the interest rate in the terms as much. So, um, it looks, it feels like it's coming from a place of. Of fear a little bit, but, you know, Jason, you've been doing a good job of meeting with them and having these conversations.

I feel. I feel you'll get them there. I'm interested to hear just with Jason kind of talking to the situation if anyone else. On the cause any other thoughts or advice, or, uh, on this situation that Jason's going through deal with.[00:38:00] 

But, yeah, anything anything else Jason anything else you want to discuss talk about. 

**Jason:** No, I think that was a good advice and continue to talk it through with multiple people in different perspectives. I think it's helpful for me. 

**Andrew:** Okay. I was going to say something real quick. I'm sorry. Right? Um, I don't know this.

This is just something from back. I used to. Lead a lot of, uh, training and coaching classes around difficult conversations. And I, this one, there's this four quadrant thing I used to use all the time. And the way I say, it's going to sound like you would never use it, but I promise that it can be beneficial.

Um, there's something called, it's called negative president, positive president, negative future, positive future. So we all live in the positive president, you know, right. But I can. At the same time, sellers are definitely living in a positive present because [00:39:00] they are, you know, they have the control, they have the thing that you want, right?

But at the same time, you know, maybe your seller's got grandkids that live two states away and he hasn't made it to a soccer game in a year. Whatever, you know, insert whatever issue there. That's the negative present. That's the real reality of what their scenario is. The negative future is what happens if you never make it to another soccer game.

Okay, so what I'm trying to do is make sure that you can get to as many soccer games as you possibly want. My goal here is to buy your business. So effectively, I mean, that's a whole conversation worth, right? You can't just take somebody through that step by step because I think you're psychotic, but you can walk somebody through.

Taking them. You're the whole reason you're even entertaining the idea of selling this business because you want a different future for yourself, right? Whether that's buying the house in florida to get away for the winter like justin was saying or whatever And [00:40:00] maybe a little bit of that because this guy's I mean, this is his baby, obviously Maybe there's something leverage point you're going there meeting him in person Which is probably the only way you could have those kinds of conversations in person but walking someone through that I can't remember what that's from.

It's someone, I did not come up with that. Um, it's definitely NLT stuff. Um, but, uh, or NLP, but the, that was, that's really helpful to get people to realize what we're actually trying to do here and maybe that might help Jason or it might not help at all. But that's the 1st thing I thought of when you said that.

**Jason:** No, that's helpful. Yeah. What, you know, his big objectives, right. You know, he's in his mid seventies. Was to see the world and spend time with his grandkids. You're trying 

**Andrew:** to help 

**Jason:** him do that. Yeah, good point. 

**Ryan:** That's great. I mean, there's an opportunity cost right to it apart from just, [00:41:00] you know, some of the things I just mentioned, like, he's saving on the broker fee, but if he, if he doesn't.

We know that if he doesn't go, if he wants, doesn't want to play ball, we know he wants to sell. He says he's 70 something years old. It's actually touches on exactly what Andrew said is that he has family in another state that he wants to move and go spend time with. Um, so there's kind of multiple angles there, um, but because we came to him, he's just kind of playing hardball to see kind of where you draw the line.

And so, uh, we It may be just some of this kind of like meeting kind of just take on a sales tactic of just being you know Meet me in the middle a little bit and seeing if you can get them Uh, you know to sign on the dotted line that way

awesome All right. Well, we got we're coming here until last, you know, justin jason. Thank you guys for sharing andrew Thank you for the advice. That was helpful Um anybody else have anything they want to [00:42:00] cover? I know everybody here has has Things are looking at right now. Uh, Gil, Chris, anything you guys want to cover in the last few minutes here?

**Chris:** I'm good. Thanks. I, um, I don't know if we have enough time, but, um, so I, the broker postponed our call, but perhaps, um, maybe we can have a little on the modeling. I could have a quick, uh, like, 5 minute review that be appropriate. I don't know if you're open to sharing. Absolutely. Yeah, I covered. Uh, yeah, I don't know if I'll bore everyone to that, but, um, but, uh, yeah, I put the speaker here and

there was me and I'll share my screen. 

**Ryan:** Okay, so he, so he canceled today. Did he reschedule with you? 

**Chris:** Yeah, I'm meeting with him Thursday. [00:43:00] Can you see my screen? Yes, let me make sure. No, this is not the 1. yeah, this is the 1. and I guess just for the benefit of all, I won't go through all, but I always do this summary page.

So business I'm looking at is a roofing company. Been in operations for over 20 years. It's in Florida and it serves like the southern part of Florida. So Miami, these counties, um, it's cool or it's interesting because it has this. I don't know anything about roofing, but it has certification that it's.

It's pretty hard to get apparently only 3 percent of the roofing of the US roofing companies have it. So that's pretty cool. Um, and then I always do this, like, many SWOT and then I, I, then I compared to what you guys gave me as well. Just so, um, I won't go into details just to maximize time, but the reason it's [00:44:00] interesting.

Well, let me take a step back. This listing, as I understand it, doesn't have an asking price. So that's part of what I need to ascertain that the broker, hence why I, like, we, you know, he, he said he was unavailable last week. He's not feeling well today. So I, we're due Thursday. Um, in the meantime, I think strength of the business, it's had rocky earnings or, you know, up and down, but the trajectory is up.

And, uh, trailing 12 for, uh, 2024 was close to 9 million. It's eight, 8 million, 740 change top line. So that's, that's really good revenue. Um, and it had roughly like a 20%, um, margin on that. So, um, we repeat customers, so uses technology. Um, so all those stuff. And then, and then making it to today's sessions of communication, how I, they seem to be looking for [00:45:00] someone to grow the business.

So where I think I can come in is like, I know about technology. I know about relationship building because of my prior time in consulting and I have business experience. So hopefully I can build some report with him there. And sort of like I speak Spanish and, you know, being in Florida, that should be helpful in my Hispanic heritage and me being from Puerto Rico.

So hopefully all those things are ways that I can find it in, but I'm like eager to get that seller call and that just. Um, hasn't happened yet. I'm now going to the part that I, because I haven't, I haven't had those calls. I haven't adjusted this, but basically, um, I've done a basic. Here we go, perform a, and, um, what I think, I guess, question number 1, before I get into the details is you, um, on the sheet, you are, um, I think it was Luke or the team has shared.

So we can do like an average of the last three years [00:46:00] or potentially like another option, but I wanted, I think maybe a weighted offer might be better and then just take the last three. And then we use 2021 was a, was a bad year for them that they had negative revenue, but then that should be. So maybe the question number one, is that something that you guys see as a, as a good, um, strategy perhaps, and then we can discuss the waiting at some point, but.

Um, Ryan or, or anyone in your experience that comes up or any, any downside to approaching it that way? 

**Ryan:** No, I would not say there's a downside. Um, I would say, you know, when you don't have a listing price, any offers it could offer. Okay. So I would, I would, when they kind of don't put a listing price, I would start with an offer that works for you.

Yeah, it's not with something that doesn't work for you or doesn't make sense to you or, you know, isn't ideally what you want and they just accept out of the blue your immediate response. Like, [00:47:00] I should have done better on that. Right so, if they don't have an asking price, um, you know, when the brokerage I used to work for, we used to not do that.

We don't do no asking price. You need to have an asking price because we felt it just, it took things, it took too long to, to, to kind of get things started. So, I always like the idea if there's if there's no asking price put together to offer that works for you, and that can be a weighted average, uh, the using the last 3 years as the average of last 3 years is just an example, but you can absolutely get it.

**Chris:** Okay, so I probably I need to need to play with this. I've assumed, like, 70 for last year, 20 percent for 2023. And then just 10 percent for 2022, but you know, I'll look into this and then I'll, I need to add myself like some salary. I'm going to look at like, what the standard is, but that could be like 100 K and even then, like, it's still a pretty high EBITDA, just assuming that so I think I would start like a [00:48:00] three, like a three X or.

2. 9 multiple so that it's a more reasonable it works for me and I'm saying that so that's how I Sorry the one uh, the model looks pretty healthy, but I I have no sense, right? So if we were to get something along those lines, that would be the so i've rounded it to four, you know 4. 3. So that would be the purchase price and then um the sim States that the seller is open to a purchase A note, so I've put it and it gave the range 10 to 15.

I know 10 is standard. So I'm just going to assume 15, like you said, working for me. Um, I know the J curve, so I've just put 2%. We could, we could argue if it's 0 for us here or not, but. Um, the owner has said that he's interested in, like, retaining either equity or being involved. So, um, maybe then maybe that will mitigate the J curve.

So we'll see. And then, uh, [00:49:00] this, you know, just rough stats, like, this seems to be the average or, you know, of, um, whether depreciation has been. Um, so it looks pretty good. I just want to make sure that because I feel with the purchase price being ambiguous, I, before I go heads down that, uh, just want to make sure that I'm on the right track.

Then I'm assuming that I'll put 10 percent down. And, um, our fee, I haven't had a discussion of working capital. So I, hence why this is blank, have a, and I haven't looked, I have a trailing 12, but I haven't really gone deep into it, um, with assuming a 10 percent interest rate. And, uh, would a 5 percent seller, 5 percent interest on the seller note be reasonable, or am I being too stingy there?

Um, no, it's the 

**Ryan:** first offer. I would, again, make it work for you, and they can always mark that up. That's not, that's not, that's not going to [00:50:00] make, uh, make or break a deal. 

**Chris:** Okay, so, um, if that were the case, then there's, there's healthy DSCR according to, to the model. I guess what I probably should spend some time this week is Playing this with another standard.

So for Rex, so that pens why I, I want to use the. Have, like, whatever I end up with the way that it being, and then having a few numbers, like, maybe at 3. 54, et cetera. Um, but other than that, um, yeah, that's just okay. So short and simple. Any, any thoughts or suggestions as I finish this, um, the analysis, obviously, I need to plug this here, and that will change the numbers, but.

I don't know enough, like, I always like to add, um, Like, if they didn't have a bookkeeper, like, what I think the rate is gonna be. If they, you know, if there's anything under my ownership, so that to lower that even a bit. [00:51:00] I don't know enough yet to, to do it. My main, not a concern, but my main maybe negotiation point or discussion on the, on the numbers is that they, they want to grow, right?

That the objective is to grow the business growth takes money. Right? So how much, um, there's evidently money left, but understanding what percent we want to distribute and the various avenues and can we sustain growth. 

**Ryan:** Yeah, and that's not something you're going to definitely get to once once you get to a seller, right?

You get to sell our conversation, talk about marketing efforts and what percentage of revenue he's currently doing to get an understanding of that. I, I've always gone off. This is that 15 percent of revenue is a good number to look at for marketing. So, uh, if you're looking at, if you're looking at the finances of the business, and you see, they're doing [00:52:00] way below 15 percent in terms of.

Their revenue for marketing. It means that they're just Mainly taking incoming orders, uh inbound sales, uh, not focusing as much on compound and marketing If they're doing over 15 It can often be a time to to think about that and think about are they Are they in a bit of trouble and they're they're kind of overspending on marketing to try to get up For the business that they previously had so you'll see When you're looking at financials, one of the things I always look at is if they're growing uh In sales dollars, but their marketing or ad spend is going up on a percentage basis.

It means that they're losing, they're losing on their, their referrals and their income sales because, but if it's the opposite way, where. The revenue is going up and the marketing expense is actually going down on a percentage basis. It means that they have just a lot of organic. Clients coming in, so [00:53:00] I kind of like to start there.

If you're going to ask about marketing or growth and just kind of look and see how much they're spending there. If you see it's below 15. Yeah, how much time you're spending on marketing? Do you think there's an opportunity to increase that? If it's below 15, they probably say, yes, if it's above, they'll probably say.

I'm doing this, I'm doing this, it's just not working and you can kind of talk about opportunities to. Uh, okay. What are you doing? Okay. You know, maybe. Maybe I could have some different ideas of things I could implement to, uh, to improve that. So, that's kind of like, uh, like, uh, a way I like to make it tangible.

That 15 percent rule. 

**Chris:** Well, 

**Ryan:** no, that yeah, I didn't know that. 

**Chris:** That's that's very useful. Thank you. 

**Ryan:** I think everything you have there in the model is great. Maybe I'm also just. Uh, shoot that over to me, Chris. I just want to make I looked at the. It looked like a multiple. And the sheet was coming at two point something and you mentioned that you want it to be around three [00:54:00] Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, that is true because that might be that might the DSR, the service that 2.

something may be a little bit inflated there. I can double check that for you just 

**Chris:** to 

**Ryan:** just to make sure. 

**Chris:** No, yeah, just put this to, yeah, to get hence why I wanted the quick, uh, like, review because I just played with it a little bit earlier today. Um, I usually like to do it after the broker call, but I figured let me just get to it.

So 

**Ryan:** yeah. Yeah Well, it's just curious. Why did he reschedule the broker? 

**Chris:** He Think it says he wasn't feeling well. Um Yeah. Oh, yeah, chris. I'm not i'm sorry for the late notice, but i'm not feeling very well right now You can't take the call. Uh, I moved the meeting to thursday. I hope you understand. That's the message

**Ryan:** awesome chris. Thanks for sharing Thank you. Okay [00:55:00] Anybody, anybody else, any, any last minute comments, questions, or anything as we wrap up the call.

**Joe:** Hey, this is Joe. Sorry, I'm not on video. I'm on the road on the interstate here and I called him late. So apologies. More of just my quick update. This time, Thursday, I hope to have under my belt a, uh, first in person meeting with a potential seller for an AC company, the one that I think I showed the model on last week, and just like what Justin was talking about right when I called in, um, the idea is just, you know, a lot of rapport building, a few more, or a handful more questions, but early Um, I guess, uh, handling early, uh, any stress or objections he may have around topics of an LOI and having in my back pocket some of those scenario [00:56:00] models, if you will, and finding, you know, some thresholds between, uh, SBA loan versus seller note so that he's kind of better educated and possibly, uh, more willing to, uh, Look at a substantial seller note, uh, versus not when he sees maybe some of the numbers that he can make.

So trying to have those numbers on my back pocket. Address the topics on the and say, we're at after, uh, that Thursday morning meeting. 

**Ryan:** Yeah, I think if you start thinking of maybe some multiple scenarios, Joe, you can kind of use the. The tactic that Justin kind of alluded to, which is just just making sure on that, that meeting that you're just really well, educating on all the possible scenarios.

Get how open he is to seller financing. If he understands what it is.[00:57:00] 

Working capital, maybe touch on that, you know, have a very simple way of explaining it. How Jason discussed on the call, like, current gas in the car. And just trying to, in your best way, uh, Bring them bring them up to speed on some of the terms that might be in the offer and gauge how many is to some of those things before you submit the why.

Yeah, so I, just to just to bring you up to speed, I did speak with him and he was. He was like, am I going to have to sign this at this, you know, when we meet and I was explaining no, this is this is just to make sure you're on the same page before Joe construction offer for you is just to make sure that, you know, a big scary legal document that might be getting sent to you is less scary and a little bit.

You have a good understanding from Joe himself before you receive it. So I made that clear.

**Joe:** Very cool. Let me ask a [00:58:00] question, um, if this has or hasn't been asked and addressed in our group, when we talk about a seller financing, no, is that what are the, what's the actual document or contract that governs that if someone were to buy a business, is that addressed in the APA? Is it a separate agreement?

What governs that 

**Ryan:** that's addressed in the 

**Joe:** APA? Okay. So it's like an attachment or an exhibit or whatever you want to call it in the APA. It's not a separate. Okay, I figured, but worth asking. Absolutely. 

**Ryan:** All right, so that calls on Thursday. Awesome. I'm excited for that, Joe. 

**Joe:** Yes, I'm here. I gotta get through this, uh, current W 2 work trip overnight, and ready to go on Thursday.

Thanks. 

**Ryan:** Awesome, man. Thanks for jumping on the call. 

**Joe:** Yep. 

**Ryan:** All right, guys. [00:59:00] That'll do it for today. See you guys next week. Athena will be back then, so looking forward to it. Have a great night, everyone. Thanks, 

**Jason:** Ryan. 

**Ryan:** Bye, guys.
