0:00 - Anke Jordaan
  It still gives you guys a chance to collaborate on some deals, maybe have, you know, things have been moving so fast.  We don't have the check-ins in the morning between me, Charis, and Cash anymore, and you guys barely have any time together just to like collaborate on questions, specific questions on deals and such, even though Athena is not here.  So, yeah, that's why I thought it'd be best if we still kept this goal. So, with this week, we can, you know, throw around some deals to each other, ask some questions that you guys have for each other.

0:38 - Luke Gillespie
  Sounds great. Charis, I saw you just sent the link to the recording of that deal that came from Barlow and Williams.  I'm going to check that out today.

0:46 - Charis Siau
  Thank you so much for that. Cool. Yeah. Any questions, just let me know, Luke.

0:51 - Luke Gillespie
  Thank you. Well, you guys have any deals you wanted to talk about? much. Are there anything you've been running into?

1:03 - Ryan Cash
  Oh, yeah. I've got the greatest deal. I've got the greatest deal that's ever been presented to the company. Is it the cat thing?
  SCREEN SHARING: Ryan started screen sharing - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/392818712?timestamp=74.838818  So I've got this deal, and it's the best deal that's ever been on the market. And, you know, I've got to get this out to a client.  Yeah. The Quiet Light broker, the Quiet Light, so this is a Quiet Light deal, and the numbers look pretty awesome.

1:34 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah.

1:35 - Ryan Cash
  But this broker is smashed. Like, this broker has no availability to be able to get on a call. He's like, I'm happy to talk to your buyer about it.  Like, I'm underwater with this deal. Given that it's a Quiet Light deal, and they do such a phenomenal job with their Q&A, is there any way that we could skip the broker call?  No. on this one and be able to get a write-up out using the Quiet Light interview that they do.

2:08 - Luke Gillespie
  That's definitely doable, and we've done it in the past. I think I know you're talking about this broker that says he's slammed.  At least try to ask him some of the most important questions over email. Be like, hey, I understand. Excuse me.  Be like, hey, I understand you don't have time for a call, but can I just ask you a couple questions here that I need to get cleared up before I can put it in front of my buyer?  And you'll really only ask the important questions like, has it been asked very pre-qualified? Although Quiet Light already answers that in the sim.  Ask if there's any other offers on the table. Ask if there's an offer deadline or anything like that, right?  Just those really important questions, things like that. Things about the deal, because normally things about the business are already all included in Quiet Light sim, but questions about the deal, like pricing, offers, deadlines, that important stuff.  You can try to get that answered over email, and then you can do a write-up. At least that's what we've done in the past.  Anke, do you have any thoughts?

3:02 - Anke Jordaan
  Yeah, my only thought on this was I know Athena would prefer to have a broker call, but if Luke says you've done this in the past, just make absolutely sure you're covering all of your bases.  Make sure you have enough information to fill in that gap. Who's the client you want to put this in front of?

3:25 - Ryan Cash
  Yeah, question. Let's figure that out. Who's the best client for Love Meowth? I'm thinking about sending this directly to Peter Jackson.  I'm thinking about getting this straight in front of PJ. Like first internet related deal. I'm coming at you hard and fast with Love Meowth, Peter.

3:47 - Anke Jordaan
  Luke, what do you think?

3:50 - Luke Gillespie
  I don't know. I'm trying to think if it would work for any of my clients. Because what exactly does the business do?  How does it make money? By selling ads?

3:58 - Ryan Cash
  Yeah, ads. It's all ads, like a million a year, it's like a million a year in ad revenue. Okay.

4:07 - Anke Jordaan
  You're spamming us, is this a legit business? You're not spamming us?

4:12 - Ryan Cash
  No, no, this is like super legit, like 100%. Like the numbers look awesome. Yeah, the price, not concerned about him, Cash?

4:24 - Luke Gillespie
  I mean, it could work for Justin, but yeah. Yeah.

4:31 - Anke Jordaan
  Oh, well, Justin is the priority.

4:35 - Charis Siau
  That's true. Do you really?

4:38 - Ryan Cash
  I mean, if you have a client that you want to roll this with, go for it. I was either going to send it to Steve and Polly, because Steve and Polly have been exploring a lot of like, I don't know, content sites in general, we've been throwing a lot of digital stuff their way anyway.  where the Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But if you've got a buyer that you think is actually a good fit, I'm trying to find just the HubSpot link for you.  Right now, Charis, I've got a million things pulled up right now.

5:12 - Charis Siau
  What you guys can also do is not only think of your current clients, right?

5:16 - Anke Jordaan
  Because in two working days, you have new clients as well.

5:19 - Luke Gillespie
  So think of them.

5:21 - Ryan Cash
  This deal is not going to be around for that, right? That's also kind of the reason for urgency here.  Like, you know, I get that we want to have a process and go through, like, channels and, like, have these broker calls.  At the same time, like, we're losing deals, right? Because of how lengthy our process is. And I guarantee you that this one's not going to be there.  So it's kind of a matter of do we want to just lose it because we have a process or, like, actually try to get a deal.

5:56 - Anke Jordaan
  Why is Charis like? I just...

6:00 - Charis Siau
  I you like sniff flowers like twice and I was really confused.

6:06 - Anke Jordaan
  I got some flowers for my husband. Aren't they beautiful?

6:10 - Luke Gillespie
  Aww.

6:12 - Charis Siau
  Cute.

6:13 - Anke Jordaan
  They smell very nice. Um, Cash, if it's a good freaking business and there's no red flags, there's nothing worrying about, it fits clients, deal boxes, put it in front?  See those cute cats?

6:25 - Ryan Cash
  What red flags could possibly be listed along with those cute cats? They're adorable. Did you see them? The website's literally called Love Meow.  Like, come on, what could go wrong?

6:39 - Anke Jordaan
  What could go wrong?

6:40 - Ryan Cash
  Alright, about, um... Can we keep it, Anke? I'll feed it, I'll take care of it, like, I'll clean up after it, can I please keep the cat?

6:51 - Anke Jordaan
  Gosh, you're so  funny. Um, what's the ASDE looking like? What sort of clients fits the ASDE?

6:59 - Ryan Cash
  A million... A a million in SDE, four million in SDE, dude, I'm sorry, but is four million dollars asking me?

7:12 - Anke Jordaan
  A million in SDE? Who looks at that many, that many, what's wrong with Americans?

7:18 - Ryan Cash
  Dude, where in the world is it? Anyway, that's all I got, guys. Yeah, if y'all have a client, if you really think Justin or whoever would like the profile, go for it.

7:44 - Luke Gillespie
  I wouldn't want to put a cat on me, love meows.

7:46 - Charis Siau
  He'll be so pissed off, he'll be like, this is what you mean? Like, aligning our deal box?

7:53 - Ryan Cash
  Yeah, hey, dude, Justin, hear your concerns, bro. Like, we've re-evaluated, we've got you one that's-

8:00 - Luke Gillespie
  Perfect for your deal box.

8:02 - Ryan Cash
  Up the tee.

8:03 - Luke Gillespie
  Up the tee. Like, like after our previous conversation, I wouldn't want to be this, this be the deal that I put in front of him right after that.  Maybe, maybe, maybe a couple of write-ups later after we have him in a good place, he has some deals he likes.  I could throw this at him. But right now, I, I think Anke would agree. We don't want to put this in front of Justin like tomorrow or next week.

8:25 - Anke Jordaan
  Okay. There's no way. There's no way in hell. Okay. Let's, let's talk. Let's talk our clients who need something, right?

8:33 - Ryan Cash
  Sorry. Cause it's literally just called something dumb. Okay. Pulling it up. No, like my thoughts was like, so here's the deal.  Me and Peter got into a flow on our last conversation. Sorry. My computer just froze.

8:48 - Anke Jordaan
  Can y'all hear me? All right. Oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

8:51 - Ryan Cash
  So me and Peter, I got him to open up. Super excited. Luke was there all, you know, Peter's like, yeah, I want to like explore a lot of different.  Opportunities like three months ago, I would say like no to everything, but I kind of want to jump in and look at some more stuff.  I think Peter would also think it's freaking hilarious at the same time. And I think he would appreciate the process of going through an opportunity like this as a learning opportunity, Anke.  Talking about growth minded mindsets here. I think that we can do this. And we've already put so much effort into this.  Like it's not up the alley, but it ends up being a learning experience for us anyway. It's a great opportunity.  should get in front of them.

9:43 - Anke Jordaan
  Okay, here's my question. Luke, Athena is in this room with us. Is she saying yes, you can put it in front of Peter or not?

9:57 - Luke Gillespie
  You might other... You might also have other...

10:00 - Ryan Cash
  Deals that will be going out to Peter. It's not like this is the only deal that will be put in front of him.  I've also got an e-commerce deal that will be on his desk by the end the week, right?

10:09 - Luke Gillespie
  Given that, Cash, I think what Athena would say is, I'm trying to channel my inner Athena. Okay. She would probably say, the deals that you have that you can get a write-up first that are kind of more quality businesses, something that would be more his style, put that in front of him first.  And then maybe on your next deal or over a Slack message right now, you could temperature check it to him.  Or she would probably say, yeah, get the good deals out first, like the e-commerce, distribution business, something like that.  And then you could throw this one on his desk, like, is I think what she would say. If you have other options, go for the better options first, and then throw this one on the side once you're able to get him, get other deals in front of him.

10:59 - Ryan Cash
  And I would... Say, Athena, I hear you. I hear you, Athena. But we both know Peter doesn't have any style.  He's got no style. And he's got no deal flow, right? So he's in an experimental phase of looking at his style.  So we want him to try on the bell bottoms. We want him to try on the cowboy hats. want him to try on the Love Meow content newsletters.  See him get a feel for what he likes out here.

11:29 - Anke Jordaan
  Paris, what's your thoughts on the cat thing?

11:36 - Charis Siau
  Honestly, I need to know a little bit more like what the current owner is doing. So what would Peter need to like replace?  You know, like does he need to be on the techie end or?

11:54 - Luke Gillespie
  I'm a quick question.

11:59 - Ryan Cash
  No, great. question. And frankly, like, I don't want to dive deep into this until I get, like, some sort of clearance that this is something that I can put in front of them in general, right?  Like, I'm not going to do a deep dive on the sim without, like, getting some sort of green light that I can do this at all.  There's just too many other uses of my time here.

12:25 - Anke Jordaan
  I think I agree with Luke on this is something that is just so weird and random. I would do it as a tape check, like you say, before you dive into this.  You know, tell them, like you said, this is a, you just open up your box to, what is it, this e-commerce or just this fall under, what is this fall under?  What's the industry here? This is This is A1 internet content with advertising revenue. So tell them, you, you, you think this is an amazing business?  You think this is a real cool opportunity? You just, oh. Open up a steel box. You want a temperature check with him, test the waters.  What is thinking about this before you deep dive into this business to get some more information on it? And if you're saying that you don't know what the actual, what the owner currently does, was that going to be like part of the questions that you would email over to the broker like Luke said?

13:23 - Ryan Cash
  No, because it's going to be in the sim that Quiet Light put together. So I'm definitely not going to ask that one because it's going to be covered already.

13:32 - Anke Jordaan
  Oh, OK, great. So you have this sim. You just haven't deep dived into this business.

13:37 - Ryan Cash
  Yeah, I know the like rough estimates of like what they're making, like how much the deal costs. Like, is there anything I see that would kill it?  No. Have I like deep dived into a deal where I've even talked to the broker or since it was like a weird situation, like even gotten the green light from the team?  I can do this. No.

14:08 - Anke Jordaan
  Yeah, I would I would agree and say if you want to put this in front of Peter, I would put it in front of him as a tame chick.  We're tasting the waters. We're seeing what you feel about it. You know, Peter can be like, dude, I'm allergic to cats.  Like I don't even want a business about cats. Or he could be like, I am the biggest cat lover in the world.  I love this. Put it in front of me. We don't know.

14:34 - Ryan Cash
  Yeah, 100 percent. Right. Like, I think that's definitely the play is to like use it as calibration and as the very least thought experiment and do a new vertical for sure.  Yeah, like it.

14:53 - Anke Jordaan
  Open up the open up his thoughts. Like, I just don't want this business. you then ý for To close down the avenue that we just got opened, right?  So I don't want this to be too scary. like, oh, , is this what you meant when you had me open up my industry list on our call today?  Like, if this is going to turn into excitement, then yes, do the team check. And crawl back into his mind.

15:23 - Ryan Cash
  Yeah, and I think even the words you're using are, like, a lot more serious than it actually is, right?  It's not like me and Luke had, like, a conversation to open up his industry list. It was a lot more of a casual...

15:41 - Anke Jordaan
  Just a chit-chat. Chit-chat, right? Okay, sounds good.

15:51 - Ryan Cash
  I'd rather have PJ have a lot of deal flow right now in general, because he's still doing a lot of...  He's still doing a lot of soul searching, a lot of trying to figure out what it is he actually wants to do, so.

16:07 - Anke Jordaan
  Yeah, so then do a team check, do it as a calibration situation, like, you know, came across my desk, thought immediately of you, Peter, after our conversation today, what do you think?

16:22 - Ryan Cash
  Yeah, no, I think he'll have fun with it, so.

16:26 - Anke Jordaan
  I'll have fun with it, I love cats, I'm a very big cat lady. So, okay, sounds good, I'm excited about it.  I love that we're having, actually having deal flow that we can be like, guys, this is a great deal, who wants it, right?  That's freaking, that's freaking the ideal, who has more of these?

16:52 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah, I don't have any right now, when they come up, I send them in the channel, but yeah, it's exciting.

17:00 - Charis Siau
  So I currently have like one off-market deal that might come to surface here. I just got the contact connected me to the owner.  And so just wanted to feel through the deal. It's really high level. They have a five, like a five location child care center in DFW.  And they're open to like whether they sell it all together or if they sell them like individually. They just sell like one or like two, et cetera.  They do, I think for the most part, own the real estate. And I think they're also looking to sell the real estate.  So is, I know, I think Luke, have, do you have some clients? in Dallas area?

18:03 - Luke Gillespie
  Justin, open a DFW if it's something that he would only have to go in person once a week, right?  So if these guys were just operating like at a high level oversight and they weren't like one of the teachers or something that it could work for him.  Let me see if he's open. Yeah, he's open to daycare businesses. Yeah.

18:25 - Charis Siau
  Oh, only have one client in Dallas, huh? That's surprising.

18:30 - Luke Gillespie
  Well, Morgan's open to Dallas. Justin's open to Dallas. There might be a new client coming on open in Dallas, not that I know, but yeah.

18:40 - Charis Siau
  Okay, okay. So depends on like the needs for him kind of on site. don't think she's like the teacher.  She actually has like a CPA background. And she's older. The husband's like in his late 70s, I think, and they own like a bunch of other businesses.  So they're, he wants to free up her time.

19:04 - Luke Gillespie
  Interesting.

19:05 - Charis Siau
  So essentially it could work depending on the, the onsite needs.

19:12 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah. Depending on the owner's role. Exactly.

19:15 - Charis Siau
  Okay, cool. Awesome. And what, what is, um, what is, I guess, both of their deal target max?

19:27 - Luke Gillespie
  Um, for Justin, he can go high. He's willing to go up to 10 million. He wants bigger deals. He says, Morgan can't go very high.  He's only going up to like three, four or 5 million.

19:36 - Charis Siau
  Okay. So Justin, is he also open to doing real estate?

19:42 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah. He loves real estate. He's a real estate guy on the side.

19:45 - Charis Siau
  Oh, perfect. Okay, cool. Great. I will, I'm hoping to get connected with them next week. So I'll update you after I have an owner call.

19:59 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah. Yeah, please do. Thank you. Glad to roll that up.

20:08 - Ryan Cash
  One thing I just remembered that I wanted to bring up, like, here's also the sim for the cat thing, but, dude, that Falcon deal.  Like, I feel like if we're going to hand off deals that clients have actually spoken to, we probably need a better process for handing those off, because there was a lot of information in that Slack channel that would have made us look pretty bad if we weren't aware of it going into another call.  And gave a lot of context as to why the owner of the company was frustrated when we reached out a second time.  Yeah. Definitely would be good to have, I don't know, whether it's like making sure we get like the Slack messages, like into the deal card or something.  Luckily, we were able to get the right information, but yeah, I mean, definitely like the new clients who are talking to the seller, like should probably be aware that whatever the conversation was that was already had.  But that way they don't go in and just like kick a hornet's nest and have a bad experience.

21:52 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah. There's a lot about structuring and offers of stuff that. You can pass to Stephen Pauly from Gil's experience.  There was a lot of info there.

22:04 - Ryan Cash
  Yeah, there was a lot of stuff there, which was good. I was able to update the write-up after being able to get that.  But because HubSpot didn't really have anything in it, I had just assumed that Gil... I didn't know that Gil had even had a deep conversation or back and forth with this guy.  Like, assumed that he had just, like, passed on it, because that's just what the HubSpot looked like. So, I had reached out to the owner under that assumption, and there was obviously a lot more that had gone on.

22:50 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah, that was just probably a communication lapse on our side. We should have told you that. But I thought when we talked about it, you...  No, I think it's just something like in the future, there's probably going be a lot more of these.

23:07 - Ryan Cash
  So we should probably just keep that in mind. Like going forward, there's probably not going to be a complete set of information to who the deal is getting passed to.  So we should probably make sure we just take some extra steps to make sure that even if it's just like a note in HubSpot, like detailing like how the call ended or like, you know, even if it's just like the slacking it off, just getting like some kind of update on like what happened with the deal.  Especially, I don't know, it's probably also like a one-off, like you talked to that owner, Luke, and he's probably one of the least pleasant people to kind of interact with.  So it might have just been. A rare case of, you know, a strange situation.

24:07 - Anke Jordaan
  Luke, did you talk to me about that? Yeah, yeah, I did.

24:11 - Luke Gillespie
  He was like, all right, on the call with me, I guess, yeah, like Cash says, he wasn't necessarily the most personable person, but it looks like Gil didn't have a great experience with him.  Charis knows a lot more about that, but yeah, it looks like Gil, this guy, like, this guy thinks his business is worth way more than Gil was willing to value it.  And he kind of got mad at Gil for low-balling him and told him, like, no  way out. Well, I mean, I think Gil was also pretty well aware of it, right?

24:39 - Ryan Cash
  Like, he looked through the email and Slackchains, Gil was like, I really don't want to send this offer over.  Like, it's actually pretty embarrassing for me to even send this, and it seems really condescending for me to even send this offer over.  And, but he did the math, it's what worked for him. So, he did. And obviously, the seller was offended by the offer.  So, yeah. I spoke to Gil today about it.

25:20 - Charis Siau
  And I asked, was like, you know, did you have like a rough time with the owner? And he said, like, he was really just like a short, a short, like communicator type, like all of his emails was like one, one, one and a half sentences kind of deal.  And so, you know, a little bit of a more rigid personality. But I think ultimately for Gil, Gil's not looking for a business that has like no owner workload, which felt the like amazing strength with Falcon is that.  doing that, It's like almost zero like owner workload or minimal at least. And so for Gil, he's like, I'm not looking for that.  He doesn't want anything like semi-passive. He wants to put in like a full like 40 hour a week and wants to be like super involved in the business.  So the multiple that the owner for Falcon is looking for, I don't think is absurd by any means, but it depends on like their preferences on what matters to them in terms of like the value of kind of that low workload.

26:35 - Ryan Cash
  I mean, frankly, I think that the terms that the seller came back with were more than fair. You know, he's willing to come down to 1.8, including inventory and working capital.  And he was like, he was upfront about the revenue decline. He said, I expect a 5% decline in revenue next year.  I'm willing to do a seller's note at like a forgivable note at the 5% decline that I expect. He's like, I'm not going to do a forgivable performance-based note for today's revenue because I'm telling you it's going to decrease by 5%, but I'll hang my hat on the 5% decline and you can hold me to that.  I thought it was pretty fair, to be frank. But I get that he wanted more of a workload. That said, did he really not think that he could find work to do to grow the business?  Because I feel like he probably could, right?

27:35 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah, I guess now that we're talking about it and rethinking it over, I'm taking a look back at the numbers on Notion.  I remember Gil saying the big thing was that they had an increase in performance, TTM, and that this was a big outlier number or something.  But when I'm looking at it, it's not that much of an outlier. In 2024, they did 447K in SDE, and then TTM, they supposedly did 527K.  7K, which isn't that huge of a jump. And then the asking price based on their TTM SDE, his asking price was only a 3.6X multiple.  I would say this guy even undervalued his business. Interesting. Now that we're kind of going back to it and thinking it over and talking about it.  Yeah. Interesting. I think there was also a problem, Charis, with like some of the ad backs probably weren't going to be recognized that he was trying to acknowledge.

28:31 - Charis Siau
  Yeah. And he said like, you know, because he knew he was going to sell this year, that like he was a little bit more aggressive on the ad backs to get his valuation higher.  And, you know, for Gil, that rubs Gil the wrong way, you know, because he's pretty like dry and doesn't like the nuances, but like every business owner does that, you know, it's the name of the game.  Um, but I, yeah, I think, I think forgetting. There was just too many things. Sometimes they'll make excuses, right?  On like, why I don't want the deal, even though like the valuation makes like total sense, right? I think there was things that bugged him about the owner.  And just like, it didn't matter. I don't think it mattered what price, unless he was getting an extreme discount, that he would take it.

29:28 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah, yeah, I think you're right. Gil is a sensitive guy. I mean, a lot of our buyers are because they're just like, upstanding, honest people.  But the thing is, sometimes these business negotiations, like it's rough, and you better just not give a  sometimes. And sometimes that's what succeeds in these business negotiations.  And I totally hear you there. I think you kind of understood it well, Charis. The guy just rubbed him the wrong way, and he didn't want to work with him.  And that's what Athena says all the time. What we do is it's all about relationships. And we're not trying to be that businessy rough negotiator.  We're trying to match the right. I buy it with the right seller, have good relationships and all that good stuff.  Yeah, because yeah, I mean, as we keep going over this and I'm looking at the multiples that Gil was offering, like, I think the seller might be right, .

30:17 - Anke Jordaan
  It's good business and it would work for Cash's client.

30:29 - Ryan Cash
  Whoa, am I the one breaking up here?

30:32 - Luke Gillespie
  No, you sound good. Oh, I can't hear you. seems frozen to me.

30:38 - Ryan Cash
  Is she frozen to everyone else?

30:40 - Charis Siau
  Am I frozen? Yeah.

30:42 - Anke Jordaan
  Oh, there you are.

30:43 - Ryan Cash
  You're back now.

30:44 - Luke Gillespie
  Okay.

30:48 - Anke Jordaan
  So there was a lot of information, if I understand it correctly. I've been in meetings all day, so I haven't checked all of the Slack channels yet.

30:54 - Ryan Cash
  But there's a lot of information. in meetings all day? No way. We don't believe you. No way.

31:03 - Anke Jordaan
  There was a lot of information on the Falcon deal stuck in the Slack channel that wasn't in the HubSpot deal.  Is that kind of like where we're at? then so Cash didn't have the entire picture of what went wrong with this deal.

31:16 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah, and then we've kind of just been gossiping. After that, we've just been like talking about the deal itself.  We kind of crossed that bridge like 10 minutes ago.

31:25 - Ryan Cash
  We've been just discussing the deal itself at this point.

31:30 - Anke Jordaan
  No, I know, but I mean, are we talking about you need more information or are we just like, just gossiping?  Okay, all right. We're good.

31:41 - Ryan Cash
  I think it probably is some kind of process that we'll want to think about because we just don't want that.  I think that we should probably have something of a process. Yeah. That's this. That be Make sure that we're just not leaving out information if we're going to hand off a deal that a client has already, like, spoken to.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.

32:12 - Anke Jordaan
  Yeah, so did the owner get back to you, Cash? Because I see the email in HubSpot you sent out to him, but I was wondering if the owner got back to you.

32:21 - Ryan Cash
  Because you guys were talking about frustration. Yeah, we texted last night. He sent me a text at, like, 10.40 p.m.  And I was actually online.

32:31 - Luke Gillespie
  So I was like, dude, I can actually do fly. it, too. I saw it, too, yeah. You want to read the text what he says?  I guess it was only, like, 8.40 for him.

32:40 - Ryan Cash
  But, yeah, no, anyway. Like, yeah, he said he'd be open to talking to our buyer. He was like, but you should know.  Like, he was like, but you should be aware. Your other buyer lowballed me. Like, we're really hard.

32:58 - Luke Gillespie
  And I was like, dude. Dude. I actually don't know anything about what you're talking about.

33:07 - Charis Siau
  The problem, too, with that is that, like, he wasn't, like, there was a little bit of a stick on the budging, and he said, well, if you take in these considerations and, like, and I won't do the, I can't remember if I'm getting all the details right, but something about the seller note, the performance-based seller note.  And he was like, well, you know, if you consider it without that, what would you offer? Like, he said, he wanted to hear, I don't think, I don't think Gil really wanted to share what his offer was, but when an owner asked, like, what are supposed to do?  Like, oh, no, it's too, it's gonna be too low, you know? I think, I think when you ask, you kind of open yourself up to seeing what that, what that low number is.

33:54 - Ryan Cash
  Yeah, no, that's fair. No, and I agree, like. Frankly, I did the little valuation scorecard, and it came in closer to 1.5 on just that little back-of-the-envelope valuation when I did it.  So I don't think Gil is wrong in what he's saying, but there's a valuation, and then there's what people are willing to sell and willing to buy at.  And I don't think that the sellers meeting him a little bit was unreasonable, right? Like the 1.8 and throwing in the inventory, the working capital, and willing to de-risk it with a note.  What are we arguing about at that point? The difference of $200,000? So at that point, it's just kind of like, do you actually like business?  Okay. Okay. Bye.

35:04 - Luke Gillespie
  Now that we keep talking about it, we hear things from our client's perspective, and we always feel like taking our client's perspective side, and I'm thinking like, oh, this sounds like an  or something based on what Gil's saying.  I'm looking at the model that he did for the offer at $1.6 million, and even in his no-change scenario, his debt service coverage ratio is above a two for nine years out of the 10-year SBA loan.  Even in his worst-case model, his debt service coverage ratio for the first five years looks better than some of our clients' offers in their best-case scenario.  Yeah, that's a good insight.

35:42 - Ryan Cash
  I didn't look at that, but that is interesting.

35:47 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah, this is really fun being able to about this.

35:51 - Charis Siau
  Like, you don't have to do anything, and you need making so much money. What's the feeling? that feedback guy is of crazy.  Like, I, no.

36:00 - Luke Gillespie
  I want to workload.

36:01 - Ryan Cash
  It's kind of like, dude, you don't think you can find something to do at this business? Like, find work to do?  It's like, dude, you're the owner. Like, you don't think you can't find a way to give yourself 40 hours of work to do?  Like, have that. It's it has to be an excuse.

36:17 - Charis Siau
  It's just an excuse.

36:18 - Luke Gillespie
  Like, yeah, it's such a benefit. Yeah, I'm loving this conversation. We never get the time to, like, gossip about the deals like this.  This is, something that you get when you're working in person in, like, a bank and you talk about the deals.  This is fun. And it's really opening my eyes. Like, holy . Gil was, Gil was, he did  over this seller.  Like, he low-bought him like crazy. This is insane.

36:42 - Charis Siau
  Oh, my God.

36:42 - Luke Gillespie
  And I think as a learning opportunity, like, Karis, because you're going to be working with Gil in the future.  And I think this kind of happened because the ball had kind of got dropped. I feel like all of this, this, these negotiations were all happening when we were onboarding U2.  And so I was working with Gil. I was doing Gil's deals and Karis was also doing. And then Athena was still the advisor.  it was one of those like when no one takes responsibility, no one does it type of situations. Because I realized if I just would have like taken the time to think harder about what Gil was saying, I mean, I just opened up this model and one minute I could see like, oh my God, this guy's low volume and like crazy.  Yeah, that's so interesting. So maybe now we know this about Gilcare. Maybe something to learn about future deals. Yeah, for sure.  That's something you guys learn and something that I'm learning this too now that I'm doing a lot more of the client calls is like, sometimes you like our job a lot of the times is to push back on our clients, kind of give them feedback and try to guide them towards the direction that we want them to go.  But sometimes like they just feel so personally so passionate about something that they will refuse to like go in the direction that we want them.  And like this might have been like case with Gil and this guy, this deal. Yeah.

37:59 - Charis Siau
  Yeah, I think so. So because even I was like, I think I said something to Athena. I like, I don't, I don't, like, I feel like the valuation he's giving is like low.  I don't get, I don't get it. And so I had, I pointed out like all the strong things and like the multiple wasn't much.  And at the end of the day, Gil was like, oh yeah, like I'm not working. I'm not looking for those benefits.  That's not like the type of business I'm looking for, even after pointing out all those strong points. So I think it was really like a personal preference at that point.  And I was like, I mean, and it's so weird because you would think it would be perfect deal for Gil.  Like trading systems, you know, so much about that industry.

38:43 - Luke Gillespie
  I know. And I'm looking at the cashflow right now. It's so good. Like it's way higher than his minimum that he's looking for.  It's right. Wow. I'm, I'm really confused here. Another thing that I've run, another thing that I've run into working with these clients sometimes.  And obviously, like, we're biased because we're our perspective. We want them to close on the deal. And we're not the one for the personal guarantee on this SBA loan and everything.  But sometimes, like, I think about how rare it is to find a good business and how hard it is to close on a business.  And these clients will reject a deal just because they didn't like the broker or didn't like the seller. It's like, just because you have to deal with an , you just don't want to work on this deal.  And I'm like, you know how rare and like high quality this deal is, something like that. Although for the seller relationship, I understand you're a little more because you want to have a good relationship there.  But, but yeah, this, this one is a real eye opener to me. I hadn't thought about it until we started talking about this today.

39:38 - Charis Siau
  Seriously.

39:39 - Ryan Cash
  Hey, Anke, like, Athena doesn't actually need me to go buy Apple gift cards for her. Does she? I'm getting like some Chinese scammer saying that they're trying to get me to go buy Apple gift cards right now.

39:58 - Anke Jordaan
  Yeah, I guess that was one of the ones. I think, Luke, I think you all sent me once, like, is this really Athena, like, asking me to buy something?

40:08 - Luke Gillespie
  What am I going to do with these $500 in Apple gift cards now?

40:13 - Anke Jordaan
  You want me?

40:21 - Ryan Cash
  Okay.

40:22 - Anke Jordaan
  Well, I mean, the Falcon deal is still alive, then Cash. And I just took a look at the sim for the Meow Meow thing.  I want to buy that business.

40:31 - Ryan Cash
  Right? Like, I want to buy this business. Like, it looks awesome.

40:39 - Anke Jordaan
  I quite a lot wouldn't put that, like, sim, like, don't put the website in front of the client. Put the sim in front of the client.

40:47 - Ryan Cash
  No, no. I'm going to put, like, my entire Luke video is just going to be me playing around with the website, going to the different links and exploring my favorite cats.
  ACTION ITEM: Conduct broker call for Love Meow deal @ 8:30am tmrw. Prep key Qs - pre-qual, offers, deadlines. Get deal info for write-up.
 - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/392818712?timestamp=2456.9999  That's... that are live on the site. That's all it's going to be. All I'm going to send Peter.

41:03 - Luke Gillespie
  I'm trying to think Anke, like who of our clients have cats?

41:07 - Ryan Cash
  I want to say, no, for real though, if anyone actually has, like, I have a meeting with the guy, the broker at 830 tomorrow, but if anyone actually, I was, you know, was able to get it on the calendar.  So I'm not talking about their cat deal.

41:21 - Luke Gillespie
  I want to say Destin and Lindsey have cats. They look like they have cats.

41:27 - Anke Jordaan
  Look like they have cats, right? It feels like that.

41:30 - Luke Gillespie
  was going to say that about, about Gil too. I feel like Gil would have a cat.

41:35 - Ryan Cash
  I feel like, I feel like Gil keeps like a pet, like cheetah. He's probably got a pet cheetah in a cage.

41:43 - Anke Jordaan
  No, no, it probably keeps like a pet. With bars of gold stack around it. No.

41:49 - Luke Gillespie
  Gil's a reptile type of guy.

41:53 - Anke Jordaan
  Is he really?

41:54 - Charis Siau
  No, I was just dodging.

41:56 - Luke Gillespie
  Making jokes.

41:58 - Charis Siau
  No, we should really like the . Asking these questions in our buyer discovery call, like, what pets do you have?

42:04 - Luke Gillespie
  This is important. Like, if a pet person or a dog person, like, that will influence the way that we look at deals.

42:12 - Charis Siau
  Yeah, if we would have had a pet question on our questionnaire, we would know exactly who's a great fit for this deal.  Exactly, guys.

42:22 - Luke Gillespie
  Gil did say before about, like, pet groomers and pet stores and stuff like that, that he's opening up because I feel like pets bring people joy.  So I want to take part in that. Oh, well, good news.

42:33 - Charis Siau
  I sent him a pet deal today and he's, like, pretty interested in it.

42:38 - Ryan Cash
  We're going to shove four by four cages down Gil's throat. We're going to get him revved up on four by four cages.

42:45 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah, make sure he doesn't lowball again.

42:49 - Charis Siau
  I know, seriously. Got to watch out for him.

42:54 - Ryan Cash
  That was a really solid point on, like, pointing out the differences between, like, accrual and cash. Yeah. Thank you.  And being able to understand how those can reflect different statements. Because I feel like that's something that a lot of people, even experienced people, lose sight of the differences on those.

43:14 - Charis Siau
  Yeah, that would, I mean, if they, what did you say, Anke?

43:20 - Anke Jordaan
  The difference they can make on a deal is massive. We had a deal last year working with a client and the entire deal almost fell apart because in the diligence, the numbers didn't add up.  eventually we realized that the clients were sending P&Ls over years, some accrual and some cash basis. And it just, it completely screwed up the QV and the lending, the lender financials and everything.  It was a massive, massive, like I had to sit with the client and I'm like, okay, pull this month, make sure it's a...  Pull that month, make sure it's accrual.

44:02 - Charis Siau
  And that was the one that you suggested, right? Like hire like a CPA and then, or like a service to be able to convert it all?

44:10 - Anke Jordaan
  Or is that a different client? Different. was a different one. Was that also accrual in cash or no?

44:18 - Luke Gillespie
  That one was nothing. That one was a notepad, a boomer.

44:22 - Charis Siau
  A notepad. There was no accounting system.

44:25 - Anke Jordaan
  He had an account system that got discontinued in 2003. So he was just running his own thing from an accounting system that got discontinued in 2003.  So it was like, you know, freaking DOS. That's how old it was. But the freaking client just needed, and I sold it for him, right?  You could pay a company $450 to convert the financials into the new system that kind of like bought that.  God. Thank Outdated, discontinued 2003 model software. It got converted to something new. It's not QuickBooks, but, you know, equivalent, Sage or something, you know, something equivalent.  He could have just put somebody to do the conversion and two lenders would have taken that deal and it would have gone through.  But he just didn't want to. He just didn't want to. But Luke will be happy we don't have that client anymore.  That was just like a nightmare client.

45:30 - Charis Siau
  Going back to the first example you gave, Anke, did you say it derailed the deal?

45:40 - Anke Jordaan
  It was a different situation. Athena was doing consulting on that deal. So it wasn't a client we were searching for.  We pulled out of that. But the deal eventually went through, like, at the end of the day. So, look, I'm glad for them.  I'm glad for them that they were able to buy that deal. But it took... I think they were in that deal for like a year and a half.  They were trying to get that deal pushed over.

46:07 - Ryan Cash
  Do you remember if they got a Q of E on it?

46:11 - Anke Jordaan
  I don't remember at all. Oh, they did. They did work with Chris Barrett on it. Yeah, they did get a Q of E on it.

46:17 - Charis Siau
  Okay. But I think they did the Q of E after I got them all their financials sorted out. Oh, damn.  I remember it was crazy.

46:30 - Anke Jordaan
  But I think the biggest thing was with the lender, right? It just wasn't making sense to them with the different.  That due diligence sheet that you guys see on the client's dashboards, that's what I used with them. I built it for that deal for them to get the right documents for each different lender.  Okay, so we have a couple of minutes left. Anybody else want to... Throw a deal in the air and see if we can catch it.  Okay. A deal in the air?

47:12 - Ryan Cash
  Oh, is that a South African thing?

47:16 - Anke Jordaan
  We have like a, if you say you throw up, it's like with sports, if you throw up the ball in the air and then the first person who can grab the ball.  I don't know if you guys have a sport that does that. Maybe basketball? Basketball, maybe? Yeah, so a throw up?  Will you throw up the ball and see who grabs it first?

47:34 - Charis Siau
  Luke and I are still in.

47:36 - Luke Gillespie
  Cash just missed her. Don't worry. I'm just losing the load.

47:41 - Ryan Cash
  Good American stuff.

47:42 - Luke Gillespie
  That was good.

47:43 - Ryan Cash
  My bad. My bad.

47:46 - Anke Jordaan
  You stuff like I'm a five-year-old Anka.

47:48 - Ryan Cash
  That's something you got to understand. Just assume that I'm like, you know.

47:53 - Anke Jordaan
  Well, the other thing is you guys need to know that my knowledge of America, right, comes from... from... A lifetime of movies and Netflix binges.  So it's like everything I know about America is what I learned from Netflix.

48:07 - Ryan Cash
  So if you see me throw up.

48:11 - Anke Jordaan
  It's all true.

48:12 - Ryan Cash
  It's all true. All of it. Believe all of it. Every little detail.

48:18 - Charis Siau
  Anke's little binge bucket is Jersey Shore. Oh my goodness.

48:24 - Anke Jordaan
  Throw me under the bus, Charis. Oh my goodness.

48:27 - Charis Siau
  I have to share this.

48:31 - Anke Jordaan
  Yeah, I'm sorry. It's like it started at Jersey Shore and it went over to the British one. What's that one called?  I don't remember. Something else. It's like the British one they did. Jersey Shore. Jersey Shore and then it was over to Geordie Shore.  And I like the British one. way. Yeah, it's it's my guilty pleasure. I'm sorry. It could be worse. I could be watching Kardashian.  Okay. Guys, me and Ida will be reaching out to you probably not tomorrow either, but then on Tuesday, to be getting you scheduled in with onboarding sessions for the next batch of clients.
  ACTION ITEM: Block out Fri AM slots in calendar for new client onboarding sessions (2hr + 1.5hr). Await Ida's scheduling.
 - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/392818712?timestamp=2963.9999  So what I need from you guys is to, it's with these onboarding sessions, it's really like hard to just give them a link and have them choose a time, right?
  ACTION ITEM: Block out Fri AM slots in calendar for new client onboarding sessions (2hr + 1.5hr). Await Ida's scheduling.
 - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/392818712?timestamp=2963.9999  So I think it's better to have a bit more control on the onboarding sessions because then you guys have control on prep for those sessions to then just block some times out in your calendar that Ida can use when she's suggesting the onboarding sessions for the next batch of clients.
  ACTION ITEM: Block out Fri AM slots in calendar for new client onboarding sessions (2hr + 1.5hr). Await Ida's scheduling.
 - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/392818712?timestamp=2963.9999  So I'm just giving you guys a heads up that that's coming. So that'll be session one, two hours, session two, one and a half hours.  And Athena used to do them on a Friday because the rest of the week was just so full of client meetings and everything.  So she used to do these onboarding sessions on a Friday morning, but it's kind of like dependent on your workflow and your client's availability.

50:15 - Luke Gillespie
  All right. Sounds good.

50:17 - Ryan Cash
  Dude, I was completely wrong. This cat business is 2.3 million delivering an 820k cashflow. It's got a 95% profit.  So literally any client here can afford this and it's SBA.

50:37 - Luke Gillespie
  What does the cashflow look like in the past though? Is it smaller? It's probably a bit on a growth trajectory.  Yeah, probably.

50:47 - Ryan Cash
  Let's see. What numbers are they using? So their number that they're using for SDE is trailing 12 months. Oh, 2024, it was actually higher.  So for full year, 2024, it was actually 866, so like 40K higher. 2023 was around the same thing, 869,000.  2022 was at 744, so. Wow, very consistent.

51:33 - Luke Gillespie
  Consistent.

51:35 - Ryan Cash
  And there's no ad bets.

51:40 - Luke Gillespie
  No ad bets. Did you ever hear back from the Brokers Association in Pittsburgh about that broker? Okay. I did send a follow-up email, Luke.

51:48 - Anke Jordaan
  I don't know if you want to pick up the phone and call them.

51:52 - Luke Gillespie
  I mean, because I spoke to Jenny about her today. She's so, she has very strong feelings of not working with that broker.  she's she's so, She doesn't even want to meet the seller. She says, if he would even associate with that lady, I don't want to meet him, right?  So she's a big pass on that and any other deal with her in the future. So I guess it's kind of a dead point.  But I told her, like, I wanted to call that lady and just ask her straight up about it. But I mean, I don't know.  I was just gonna wait to hear whatever you and Athena. Did get red-pilled on that?

52:22 - Ryan Cash
  That sounds juicy. What happened?

52:25 - Luke Gillespie
  Oh, man. You guys missed it. We had submitted a write-up to a deal for Jenny. And you know how  bad Jenny's deal flowing is, how hard it is to get a write-up.  I was literally chasing this deal for like a month. And it was finally, actually, if everything added up, it was actually a really good deal.  We found it in Pittsburgh for Jenny. And then, you know, obviously we don't run background checks on the brokers we work with.  We just have the call, talk about the business and put it in front of our client. Jenny, I don't know what gave her this idea, but she was suspicious, didn't trust this broker.  She had that tingly feeling. Googled the broker. Found her mention in an FBI conviction for mortgage fraud in the past, like 13 years ago.  She was defrauding tax returns to get people to get higher mortgage loans, to qualify for higher mortgage loans. And she was convicted of a felony and did like two, three years in jail.  And yeah, Jenny found that out. And so that was like a whole  show for us. So I'll go is, was, was like doing background checks, reference checks, making sure like if she, if other people have worked with her before and, and we haven't, we heard back from the lender.  He said, yeah, we've closed deals with her, but I feel like the lender's in on the take if she's doing anything suspicious.  And then the more we reached out to the brokers association and just haven't heard back. then Jenny did the call with the broker on Friday and just really doesn't trust this lady and just refuses to go any further with the deal, which is understandable given her past.  But yeah, that's, that's kind of the lowdown.

53:52 - Charis Siau
  Well, yeah, so, um, Helen burger, Helen burger. Oh, that's.

54:00 - Ryan Cash
  I kept seeing her text blow up on SMS. Like every day there was new Helen Berger text on the SMS channel.  H-E-L-E-N-B-E-R-G-E-R, Helen Berger.

54:13 - Anke Jordaan
  So she was like putting up on her BizBuySell profile and website and LinkedIn that they're associated with the something something broker association.  But if you go to that broker association, we couldn't find them listed as a brokerage under that association at all.  Try to reach out to the association, haven't got her back from them. On the change, their brokerage name like three different times.  And it's one of those on their BizBuySell profile, they list like reviews of how they helped people inside of the BizBuySell profile.  Like not a very good business profile, but just like reviews. So it kind of feels like you're buying something from Tim.  And they're just putting fake reviews up in it just to make the product look good. It feels really shady.  It really, everything about it feels like, why are they, if they really are turning over a new leaf and they're trying to, you know, do things the right way, why not do things the right way and not have these weird websites and LinkedIn profiles and things just, I don't know.  Everything just looks really shady.

55:29 - Luke Gillespie
  It was crazy. After I finally got a win for Jenny, just sucked the joy out of me.

55:38 - Ryan Cash
  I mean, we work in a world where there's not really like a licensing or an agency requirement, you know, it's not like these people have to go get a Series 7 and register with FINRA, you know, like, it's kind of just the risk that you play in with small business acquisitions.

55:55 - Luke Gillespie
  The felony that she got convicted for was like falsifying. don't know. And then I went and I looked at the tax returns she gave us for that deal.  And all of a sudden, my mind obviously had a bias, and was looking at it, and was like, I don't know, something's fishy here now.  She gave us tax returns.

56:11 - Ryan Cash
  This is so suspicious. Yeah, I mean, literally got convicted of a felony for falsifying tax returns. And how do you think, dude, what a crazy set of decisions, though, to serve time for that, and be like, I'm going to get into business brokering.  That's the next move. No one will figure out that I was falsifying tax returns. It's like, dude, I feel like you should probably get into something a little different.

56:44 - Luke Gillespie
  But my thing is like, but what if Jenny potentially did buy that business, she would have a Q of E that checked out the numbers and made sure the numbers added up with the bank account, right?  And then I don't know if there's a way for like to send the tax returns to the IRS. Hey, are these valid?  But because the QOVs, QOV accountants check the bank account transactions to make sure it's valid.

57:06 - Ryan Cash
  It's still going to be like a cost sink to her though, right? That she might not, like if the deal ends up being good, she can roll that QOV into like the down payment.  But if that doesn't work out, then she's just on the hook for that money, right?

57:22 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah, exactly.

57:29 - Ryan Cash
  No, that's crazy though. mean, it totally makes sense though. mean, how many brokers do we talk to on a day-to-day basis?  Like, you know, odds are that you're going to run into someone who's not a good actor.

57:48 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah, well, there's a lot that aren't. They might not be committing felonies, but they're not acting at the best standards.  Yeah.

57:58 - Ryan Cash
  Okay.

58:00 - Anke Jordaan
  Um, anybody need anything from each other? Any other urgent questions that you guys have? How's the peer review going for you?  Um, the write-ups not holding anybody up in terms of getting them out to clients, but also not completely overloading you with just giving a quick eye to each other's write-ups.

58:19 - Luke Gillespie
  You all good on that? Yep. Yep.

58:25 - Anke Jordaan
  Okay, perfect. I'm happy to hear that. Um, All right. Sounds good. I'll see you guys in, uh, tomorrow morning's deal team.

58:36 - Ryan Cash
  Keep cats top of mind. Anyone thinks of a good client for this cat deal, don't let me know. Otherwise, otherwise I'm just doing nothing but trying to sell PJ on cats.  The only deal he's going to get from me until he submits an LOI for this.

58:54 - Anke Jordaan
  Do you think, do you think,, because Ida built bots for each of the clients, that that's what. She uses for the external profiles.  Do you think AI will be able to tell Ida if there's a possibility of this person being a cat person?
