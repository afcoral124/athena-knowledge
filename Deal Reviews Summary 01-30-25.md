  So there's million things that could be talked about there Yeah, I didn't I apparently didn't sell it well enough to Josie only one that turned up though I was like this is so important Like you guys need to watch this Yeah, yeah, I guess Jason couldn't make it He's usually they would have appeared I think he went along this one, but actually he messaged us and said he couldn't make it Yeah, well when when people get close to L.O.I You'll have to give him a little homework list like hey you need to watch the insurance thing because that's gonna be a big one for you to understand You know so at least we have these these things to be able to like direct people to because Anka and I were talking about that earlier like we now have so many buyers cause meetings that when new people come in We want to try to give them the like here's the priority for you to watch these in because something Like today, it's not really relevant until you

1:00 - AcquiMatch Team
  you're staring down the barrel of an L.A.I. just signed an L.A.I.

1:04 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  as opposed to like the seller meeting conversation, right? some of the discussions that we've had are more relevant earlier in the process, but I'm loving these.

1:17 - Luke Gillespie
  What'd you think of that, Luke? Well, yeah, it was awesome. was just gonna add in and maybe periodically like client by client, for example, when say Jenny's about to do a seller meeting or something, we have Uncle Hop in the channel like, hey, check out this buyer's company when we went all over this.  But yeah, that was great. I think we should like clip that two minutes of Andy saying the oil spill is not a contamination and send it to Brian.

1:40 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  And there he is.

1:42 - Luke Gillespie
  It's not a deal-breaker. We should send that to Brian.

1:45 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, good idea. So cool. Well, Brian's got to go in like 15 minutes. So if you want to go through your stuff, and then if Luke and I need to stay on a little bit later, I've got an appointment I need to get to tonight.
  ACTION ITEM: Find emails w/ Joe & Matthias re: equity injection language. Compile for referral process doc. CC Anka. - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/222217304?timestamp=122.9999  So it wouldn't keep you too late, Luke, but if it will be useful, then okay, cool. Yeah, so let's let's give me give me the highlights then.  What's the 15 minutes worth of stuff that I need to know or you need my help with?

2:13 - AcquiMatch Team
  Okay, so the first thing is just one question. Jason's asking, what's the best way to frame your consultation as an equity injection to lenders?  He's thinking to we talked about the cylinder who doesn't work with her, so he wants to be able to pitch it correctly as terms of like, can this be included in his equity injection?  I thought it an interesting question. thought I would ask you.

2:36 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, so you should be on the emails with Joe. There should be some language that I wrote up and gave to Joe when he was talking to that lender that didn't know us, so see if he can dig that out and then send it back to me on and then we'll just add that to the referral process document.  Remember, and also get with Anka to, because she sees it on emails where Matthias and I talk to one of his lenders.  So basically what they want to see is our service agreement. And then we're the way that to me described it is we're the architects of the deal.  So it's really important that they don't call our fee a success fee. That will basically null and void it.  So they need to call it a consulting fee. You know, it's a transaction expense. We're part of the deal team that's consulting and advising them as part of the process.  And then the fee is business specific. So if they think that we were just sending them a bunch of deals and then they're adding it in, it won't necessarily be.  Then that would kind of negate it, but the fact that we're finding them a specific business and advising them on that specific business.  Then we're, you know, this deal wouldn't. exist without us. Tuni's like, you're essentially the architect of the deal.

4:06 - AcquiMatch Team
  And then that broker that you're referencing to that conversation with Joe, when was that? I could just build everybody else.

4:13 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  And you were on it. Remember when Joe was speaking to his local lender on one of the earlier deals that he was looking at getting financing for?

4:26 - AcquiMatch Team
  Yeah, if I'm on it, I can find it. I'm trying to think about which deal I was on.

4:30 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, I was the first one, I think that he was excited. can't remember what deal it was. I just remember he was speaking to a local lender.  And there was like panic stations about our fees and that sort of thing. So, you were CC'd on all those emails.  And then there's a pretty good explanation in the email that went over to Matthias and the lender that we were talking about.  And the copy of our service agreement usually is what they want to see. And then I'll also say, Like Live Oaks Head of Credit has already approved this.  They've looked at it usually if they know that the larger banks that are top SBA lenders are okay with it, then they follow suit.  But you also need to tell Jason this is the risk of you going to a lender that's not familiar with us.  So we'll give you the language, but it's on you, you know, we're not going to like go in there and negotiate this.  So that's one of the risks of you going to your local people that don't know us. We don't have that established relationship.  So, yeah, get with Anka, she'll be able to dig out that email and your CC'd on an email, compare the two.  think I broke the exact same thing for both of them, but you'll just have some language there to be able to give them and then add that to y'all's referral process.  So you have that that you could just copy and paste and send to the clients. the main thing is like tell them not to call it a success to be it's really important.  And you should be coaching clients on that. tell them like. Early on, but they'll probably forget by the time they get to the lending process.  So just also make sure that you remind them of that when they're at this stage. hey, don't call it a success fee.  We're an advisor to you, just like a lawyer. We're part of your deal team. So you need to like position us as such.  Cause even with lenders that know us, you just need to be careful. if they, if it's success fee, then it can cause problems.  Cool.

6:26 - AcquiMatch Team
  Um, then just updates, uh, uh, a coach who encourage tomorrow morning.

6:35 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Great.

6:36 - AcquiMatch Team
  let me speak in with her and talk about something. We discussed on our last call. That was really ended up last time.  was like, see if we can get her on call. got her. So she sounds optimistic.

6:47 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Great.

6:48 - AcquiMatch Team
  Yeah. That was her language. Um, Brian in, I got him on the call today. I call with him and just, uh, yeah, it would be discussed just like kind of.

8:00 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay. So that's what he's working on right now.

8:03 - AcquiMatch Team
  That's what's distracting him is transition there and that business. He says that it is but when we talked about it the first time he was saying that things were really slow because it's seasonal business.  So he gets slow right now. It's way too slow for me. do need to have somebody else that's going to work but I do what season.  It's out of season. It's been a sad season. So they're okay. like, well, I got like, take your time and do these two businesses.  Get all your questions and get back to me. That's just a little bit about how he has been.

8:39 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  said he would get better. Okay. Great. Nice work.

8:46 - AcquiMatch Team
  And then JB, let's submit it to the law. I think both doctors look really good. First told us he wanted to have $2 million, right?  Then he checked it for $2.5 to $3 million. plan. Then we reviewed the financials and it's an hour adjusting based on that off the most recent information.  And the two offers that Joe put together was a 2.1 and a 2.5 complete dollar deal. And I think those are really, mean, if the seller, if the seller may, he can't ask more for that.  He got you both deals, fast work. One is literally 5% no, all cash, SBA. And the other one's 2.5 with a big seller, no, but that's for 2.5 million, right?  So I think it looks really good. And the seller, I've been sending me email last night, are we? So I know he's anxious, like he's nice.  So we'll see what happens, right? So I got my fingers crossed about.

9:48 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, nice work, congrats.

9:51 - AcquiMatch Team
  Yeah, thank you. And yeah, JJ is still working through her. She's about to follow him in the volume side meeting with them.  Talk to me about L.O. by sort of her structure or a lot. I went over the model with her.  She's been pretty close to submitting on that one. think she's going to get back with Barlow and Loya. really nice time before she submits.  And then she even like, she's also drafting a book, drafting a book, of what it would look like to sit on this washing business as well.  In case that's a work she's just and then we'll talk about it. So we'll talk to that. But she likes both the children.  So she seems pretty happy. She has to get businesses that she is interested in submitting an offer on. And you know, those are pretty much the people that are most important people to cover at this time unless you have any questions about me by specifically.

10:53 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  No, I don't think so. I think with just one thing to note with Matthias, because he is a SBA.  Broker. We need to be careful on that one and I'm seeing him get really pissed off on social media that people are coming to him after they already have term sheets.  He's like, don't waste my time, you know, if you already have a term sheet. So I think just keeping Matthias in our back pocket, if people are having issues with lenders or getting lending and or if they just want someone who's also going to hold their hand through the process, right?  So that's kind of what Matthias is going to do, but he's very much like one at a time. So Tuesday, Lindsay's going to come on and we're going to talk in detail, SBA process, going to seven different lenders, pluses and minuses of working with a broker and not working with a broker.
  ACTION ITEM: Update lender ranking sheet. Move Matthias down. Add Wendy, Tuni, Matthias. Note when to contact each. - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/222217304?timestamp=704.9999  So just encourage everybody that's at that stage, especially Jason, to join that one or watch that one afterwards.

11:55 - AcquiMatch Team
  So then what I'll do with Matthias is I'll like rank on the shape that I'll put together in terms of lenders, I will write them accordingly.  So I'll move Matthias down and I'll just put like Wendy, Tuni, Matthias, and found out when one of each one should be contacted.

12:12 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, it's like, if Wendy and Tuni can't get a deal done, then it might warrant going to a Matthias.  They already have a relationship with Wendy, so you know, it should be easy for her to look at it.  They just need to be really careful with her that they don't tell her their shopping around because she in particular gets very pissed off because she spends a lot of time with people.  Lindsay loved working with Tuni. She said he was fantastic. So you know, he's a good reference. I have another SBA lender call who was at the event last week.  I'll to you all about him. He's really well known. going to meet with him next week, but Matthias is also very effective, but he's more of a I'm going to walk you through the process kind of thing.  We get much less of a reference. for Alfie because Matthias works off the lending referral fees. not that it's like a huge drop in the bucket for us for that, but Matthias doesn't like, he's like, if you're going to like other lenders.  So and start with those two, maybe we add a third in direct to lender with Jared, if that feels good after I talk to him and kind of tell him our process.  And then Matthias is like, we're having problems getting term sheets for somebody in particular, it means a lot of hand holding, then Matthias is a good person because he's a broker and he's that kind of buffer between the person and the lender.

13:43 - AcquiMatch Team
  Okay, cool. I'm there. Everybody else is pretty good.

13:50 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Amazing. Cool. Luke, do you have a couple minutes to update me on the other clients? Then Ryan, know you're going to get kicked out of there.  So if you need to jump off all good. you and I obviously will have time tomorrow too if you want to dig in deeper on anything.

14:04 - AcquiMatch Team
  Absolutely. to you guys tomorrow.

14:06 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay, thanks Ryan.

14:08 - AcquiMatch Team
  Bye guys.

14:09 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Bye. Yeah, I don't need to leave for my appointment until 45 minutes so I got all the time for you.  Okay, cool. Yeah, I was thinking max 15 minutes over so I've got to get ready and get down the road.  The traffic here is unreal.

14:26 - Luke Gillespie
  Here we go. How long are going to leave Miami for?

14:29 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  I'm coming back on Saturday. Okay, yeah, it was kind of a wash as far as like getting sunshine because I didn't realize but the antibiotics that the doctor gave me caused like burning and rashes from the sun so I couldn't figure it out.  I was like literally only going out for like 15 minutes and I'm like red and I feel horrible and yeah even though I told the doctor and we talked about Florida, he decided to give me antibiotics and not tell me.  Oh, but I should not go in the sun at all. It's just like a lot. Do you like getting a lot of sun and getting tan?  That's why I came here. Well, why I was like, oh, you know, I was coming for the event I went to yesterday, but I was like, I'll book for the whole week.  So I can at least get some sunshine because normally over Christmas, I'll go somewhere hot, but I stayed with my boyfriend and his son this Christmas.  So I'm like, I need sunshine. I'm dying. So I was like, oh, I'll tack it on to a work trip.  the intention of this was like a working holiday where I was like, at least going to get some sunshine.  And then the day I here, it was like pouring rain and really cold. I had like my big jacket on.  was hilarious. but business-wise, it was really successful. So I'm really happy. Like the event yesterday, you know, I since since I'm kind of the founder and the leader.  of the business, I don't have anyone that's managing me and mentoring me. So I look for opportunities to go and learn from people or put myself in situations where I'm getting coached and I'm getting mentored so that I can be a better leader for you all too.  And there's a real estate agent called Real, a real estate brokerage called Real. And I found the president who's this guy, Sharon, and he was on Layla Formosi's podcast.  just the way he was talking about the values, ethics, culture of the brokerage that he like managed and how he, know, the brokers being like independent and just everything about how he is the leader and manages his life and like, I don't want learn from him.  So yeah, the event yesterday was for real estate brokers. marketing, like how all to get buyers and get sellers.  So I was like, I'm sure there'll be some like transferable stuff for how we can get off market leads, but also I want to I want to see how he you know interacts and what the company culture is like and that sort of thing.  So it was really cool. Like the people that are part of the real brokerage are like, they're obsessed with it.  They're all really exceptional content and it was meant to help all these folks like be better at running their independent businesses, which is what real estate brokers are.  It's what all the brokers are that are even the trans world and that sort of thing are still considered independent contractors running their own little business under the brand.  It's not a W2 job. So the content, I mean, like if I were a real estate broker and I implemented  printed everything that I learned yesterday and we earning seven figures like easily, you know, like, if you actually, it was really good, really tactical, but also inspirational mindset, like, it was awesome.  And I went up to him at the end and I was like, I have a confession to make. I was like, I'm not a real estate broker, not part of your company.  I just wanted to learn from you is like, I'm working with, you know, Layla and Alex, I've been going through their scaling process right now.  he's like, they're my best friend. So I like, I know that's why I wanted to come and learn from you.  But when he did the interview with Layla, he was like, talking about how when he wanted to learn from people, he'd offer them money.  he's like, I want to offer you $20,000, please, can you just answer my emails every now and then? And so I told them, I was like, it's on my vision board to get to the point where I can offer you money to get you to answer my emails.

18:55 - Luke Gillespie
  And he's like, you don't need to do that. You can just DM me. And I was like, really? So cool.  So Oh, good for you. Yeah, that's what you hear from all the most successful people. They tell you when you're young and up and coming, they say, just go try and work for people for free.  Don't even ask for job. If you have someone that you want as your mentor, just do free work for them before you even tell them anything.  Just send them the work that you've already done before you even have a working relationship and eventually you'll catch their eye or something like that.  So I see you.

19:22 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  I mean, but you know, when you're also a business leader, there's nobody giving me performance reviews. don't have a manager, so I need to surround myself with people that I aspire to, that I can learn from, can mentor me and give me feedback, right?  And it's like if you don't have those people, you can still get in the room with those people. You can learn from those people.  So, you know, I will spend money to get that kind of mentorship and that coaching and that guidance because I won't get it otherwise.

20:00 - Luke Gillespie
  And Yeah. It seems like a big expense on paper, but actually when you look at the return on investment in your business, when you do that sort of stuff, you know, the sales coaching that I got last year, the stuff I'm doing with Alex and Leila and their acquisition.com stuff, like it's, you can see the impact that it's already had on the business and the impact that it is having on the business.  Yeah. Well, I can give you some feedback, even though I won't mean that much, but I think you're doing great.  I love the way you're carrying our business and all the directions you pointed us toward, you pointed us toward the market, and now we almost hopefully are going to have two signed L.O.I.s on our, on our belt coming into a buyer's club meetings and talking about their deals and then, yeah, the buyer's club meetings are amazing and just everything you come up with.  I like the way you're running our business.

20:49 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So I trust you and I think you're good. I really appreciate that. I need to hear that stuff sometime too.

20:55 - Luke Gillespie
  So thank you for telling me. Yeah. Yeah. We all need to get told we are doing a good job sometimes.

21:00 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  uh absolutely and you know when i'm not doing a good job too i hope you come to me and give me that feedback you know like i truly like me putting that on the strategy talk that i want us to be rated the number one place to work like it's not necessarily an ego thing like i just want people to love working here and feel like they get a lot out of it and they're learning a lot and developing a lot and enjoy it and it's fun you know like Fridays are my favorite day because they get to hang out with all you guys so really awesome i love that that's a priority for you and i know it is like the way you're doing the bootcamp for us and and you put your money where your mouth is i never got to thank you one-on-one that i never got the chance but thank you for that christmas present that you deposited into our bank accounts you don't have to do that but i i very much appreciate that thank you yeah i don't know like my own needs you know my success your success is my success and vice versa and i can't tell you how cool it is to be able to like just break down from illness  this and then be out the rest of the week in an event and I get to go to this event and I'm like and I've got this amazing team that's doing all the cool stuff and finding clients businesses and they're making offers and it's like and I just have to stand on a stage to talk to you about it like you know it's awesome it's awesome to be able to go out and be like I have this amazing team that's doing amazing work you know that feels so good and also to I don't I don't take sickness very well you know so and I'm still not handling it very well because I'm still sick and it's just like it's okay you know they've got an amazing team that are they've got it you know that feels really good I view with you you were kind of saying it last week you take sickness it's like you were defeated like no I should be winning and not get sick like because when if I'm eating healthy and living healthy I almost never get sick if I'm eating my veggies right like living healthy but sometimes when I'm you know maybe I've been drinking

23:00 - Luke Gillespie
  I've been on vacation. I've been staying out late, not sleeping as well, then I get sick, and I take it as a defeat.  oh, sickness beat me.

23:09 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  It pissed me. I'm like, I should not call my boyfriend's like, Athena, sometimes you get sick. And I'm like, not me, know?  anyway, yeah, no, it's good. I'm really happy to hear that. I'm so, so blown away by what you all have been able to achieve.  I mean, it seems normal to us because we're all really high performers, but if you compared us to another early stage business and I was going to tell you and Ryan that remind me to tell you all in the team meeting tomorrow.  One of the sales calls I had today was with a guy who worked with Aquira, which I've known about, but I've never actually talked to anybody that like went through their program and use them for deal sourcing.  But he's like, yeah, they were sending me like one deal every two months and like, no off-market deals and then they did send me off-market deals were completely out of my deal box and I'm like are you serious like and they charge way more than we do really yeah I think I'm looking at their website right now I had another program I mentioned these guys to me before I think I took a look at their website the website looks great but I guess they're not really doing that very good work one deal every two months yeah I mean that's horrible ah you know but it's it's kind of cool to hear that too because like we feel like two is a little like we want to get more than two you know but that's like what for X what they're providing yeah exactly more more than that should one deal over a two month anyway I can't do the math this late I I've got to go in a few minutes so how how are you looking or how can I support you do you need any any feedback from me feeling good I can
  ACTION ITEM: Complete 2 write-ups for SP business (commercial fencing). Follow up w/ broker for NDA. - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/222217304?timestamp=1490.9999

25:00 - Luke Gillespie
  Give you a quick summary. Let's get into it. So I have a SP business. I'm going to do two right ups after this call after my appointment later as well.

25:07 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Thanks.

25:08 - Luke Gillespie
  It's a commercial fencing business. I know SP are going to love this. They love commercial and it's fencing. It's like 70% recurring revenue, like 39% profit margins.  It's this guy. He has to go away out of the country because he inherited some land. He's got to go develop.  And his mom is the one who actually started the company. And she's not some old lady. She's like an active 60 year old woman and she wants to stay on with the company.  So she basically knows everything there is to the business. So yeah, I did the broker call this morning. I'm going to do the write up after this call and my appointment.  And yeah, I'm waiting to get the NDA from the broker.

25:43 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  guess he responded to my email. I'll give him a call after this call. But yeah, that's where we're at for SP.  So I'm really, I know they're going to like this one. Nice. Yeah. remember I feel like we've looked at a fencing one for them before and they really liked it.  So yes, and one of them that

26:00 - Luke Gillespie
  One listing that they requested from us personally for that other deal a week or two ago, it was commercial landscaping.  And Polly, what she really liked about it was that it was commercial.

26:10 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  that's why I'm excited about this one for them. Nice work. Cool. And last we talked, there was a couple coming down the track for Andrew.

26:19 - Luke Gillespie
  So how did those go? Yeah, unfortunately a call today. It was this online business. It was like a teaching education business.  And it looked like it was going to be really good. But then as I dove into one of the Excel files they provided right before our call, I was preparing for the call.  It was originally listed as 500k SDE. And then it got listed. They changed it down to 300k SDE. So I canceled the call and the broker emailed me back.  We got updated year in financials 24 and it was lower than expected. And the CEO of the guy is working like 40, 50 hours a week.  So we wouldn't put that in front of Andrew because it changed from like a 300k SDE for Andrew to like 100k.  Ryan said, we could be okay showing some smaller businesses to Andrew, but not when this guy's working 40-50 hours a week and bringing in 100k, so that was a good thing.
  ACTION ITEM: Discuss w/ Ryan re: presenting diesel repair shop to Andrew w/o full vetting. Prep write-up w/ verification areas. - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/222217304?timestamp=1628.9999  then I'm still chasing those two deals from those ATK Ventures guys and they've kind of just been lagging on me.  If worst case scenario, you really want to push out something for Andrew. Without even having all of my questions answered, I really think this is a great business.  There's this diesel repair shop that they have listed. I did do a call with the broker and I didn't get to ask all my questions.  It was more of a meeting each other call, but he got insights into the owner who he is and I can already tell just from the sim that it looks like a really good business, but I haven't done the full vetting questions.  They told me send the questions over email. I sent it to them over email. The guy just told me yesterday he's going to send it to the owner.  I called him again today to check up on he didn't pick up. So that's where I was at one.  Do you want? to wait to see if they get back to me, or do you want to push something without without doing a full broker called vetting?

28:09 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Is it competitive or are other people looking at it?

28:16 - Luke Gillespie
  When I asked, I don't think she said it was, but it looks like a really good company that would be competitive and other people would be inquiring on.  I'm looking at my notes right now because it's it's it has like a million dollars adjusted even to SD and it's semi absentee like 20 hours a week.  The current owner he's in the Bahamas right now running the company so it could be perfect for Andrew because it's in DFW area but it's a semi absentee remote run.

28:48 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  I have a like so I don't like when they're like send the questions over because it buys them time to start accepting offers now.  Right. So then it's like, I feel like if you feel really good about it, then we can go to Andrew and be like, Hey, these are the questions I have out with the owner or with a broker, but also it's such a good business.  We don't want to lose time that there might be people making offers. you know, the next thing you could do then is go back to the broker and say, Hey, I really want to get my clients kind of perfect for this.  Can I get it in front of them?

29:30 - Luke Gillespie
  And then we can loop them in on these further conversations. Yeah. Yeah. And looking back at my notes from the call.  So he said, this seller, know, he's not looking to give it away quickly. And he's firm on his asking price of $5 million.  So it doesn't sound like a.

29:47 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So it's the five acts.

29:48 - Luke Gillespie
  Okay. Yeah. But it still leaves good SDE. I'm pretty sure DSCR for Andrew. forgot both calculator. But so that's what we're out with that one.  I feel good about it. And I know we're trying to get something for Andrew, because for his last month, but it's just not playing out the way we wanted with the broker answering our question.  Sometimes when they say send the questions, they're stalling because they're entertaining offers. Interesting. Ryan said because he had worked with this broker before and said he knew very little about the business.  Ryan said I was surprised how little he knew actually. And this is when I started, we shifted the conversation like 10 minutes in after meeting each other to the business.  He was like, oh yeah, we normally like to have you send your questions over email, and then we send that to the owner so that they can answer themselves and then you get a lot better answers.  And I was like, well, okay, then. And he said he has this real estate deal coming up that he thinks Andrew would be a perfect fit for us.  I was like, oh yeah, I'd love to see that as well if it's coming up soon. And so that's where we are.  They gave me access to some extra financials about the business. But yeah, they're just It's just been kind of moving kind of shady the way they're acting like They they when I sent for another Business I had inquired upon it was a metal fabrication shop They do they're located in DFW, they do some work in Oklahoma So again could be a good fit for Andrew and again They said email the questions I emailed the questions And then I called the brokers like subbroker or whatever and he said yeah So a lot of the questions that you asked they could be answered by the additional information I'll give you in the deal files.  There's a Q&A in there and everything And so then he gave me access to the files and that the Q&A wasn't there There weren't that many extra files and and that's what I've been chasing him again trying to get so I'm really just doing everything I can for Andrew And I maybe if we make it real with this broker that we do have a genuine person and make an introduction That like you know cuz that's not really a good seller relationship either to have all the questions like over

  and then be sent to the seller and be ideal. what do you know the next steps? Like, if we were to bring Andrew and do it, like at what point or when can he meet the seller?

32:11 - Luke Gillespie
  I want to remember, I think the broker was pretty open to, he's like, yeah, could have Andrew meet the seller.  Because maybe we just do that and get that relationship started if you think it's a good business. Okay. Yeah, I mean, I think it's good.  And I just, I don't feel great about the two businesses we got Andrew this month. That's why I'm willing to kind of, I was kind of feeling like pushing this without doing the full vetting questions and just in that areas of verification section on the right of I'm just gonna include a lot of questions.

32:45 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, just say we don't, know, time kills all deals. This broker is kind of acting as a weird gatekeeper.

32:52 - Luke Gillespie
  not, you know, we'd rather get you directly in touch with the seller on this one because it sounds like they are facilitating that.

33:00 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Here's all the questions that we would ask after that. That's what I would do, double check it with Ryan, do the right up in that then that way.  double check it with Ryan and then get it over to Andrew so that we can cut this. If this broker is creating this whole like, oh, I'll send it to the seller and then they'll get it back.  Like we might as well just connect Andrew to the seller.

33:23 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah, yeah. I've already shown him the buyer profile. He knows about Andrew. He's like, yeah, sounds like a great guy, a great buyer.  And so they talk really nice, but then they don't really answer my questions when I get to them.

33:36 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah. Well, sending a bunch of email answers is like, not what the owner is going to want to send their time on.  So that's like, if they're doing that with all of the prospective buyers, it's a  waste of time. So what would be better is like, if we can get Andrew meeting the seller, if they like each other, then they can go deeper and get those things answered.

33:57 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah. This broker's they have like really good deals though. I don't know. They claim to be a Christian brokerage.  they just get deals through their Christian network and deals, but yeah, both the deals are really good. That's why I'm so excited about them.  So yeah, I'll talk to Ryan tomorrow. Ryan, he likes, he really likes to do the broker call because that's a big part of the value we provide to our buyers, our clients, sorry, but that's why I'm just saying it's just the trade off of not doing the full vetting versus we really want to get Andrew something.  So that's why I'm bringing it to you and Ryan to ask your guys his opinion. Yeah, well, like whatever he says goes, he has final say, so you run it past him and see what he thinks tomorrow.  Awesome.

34:38 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay. Great. I need to run, but great work is always. If you need anything else in addition, let me know and we can find some time tomorrow.

34:48 - Luke Gillespie
  Yes. Awesome. Yeah. I will talk to Ryan tomorrow and we'll make a plan.

34:54 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay. Great, Luke.

34:55 - Luke Gillespie
  Nice work. Yes. Have a great night. Bye. You too. Bye.
