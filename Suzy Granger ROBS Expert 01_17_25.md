# AcquiMatch Buyers Club 01/17/25

[00:00:00] 

**Athena:** Hello. 

**Suzy:** Hello. 

**Athena:** Hello. Hey, Gil. 

**Gil:** Hello. 

**Athena:** Hey, everyone. Hey, Athena. Hey, Joe. How's it going? Hey, Lou. . Cool. If anybody else wants to throw a video on feel free. So Susie can see your faces. I thiNk we got Chris here too. Amazing. Uh, this is Ryan from the equity match team, and we'll probably have some other folks jumping on as we go through, but thanks for being here today.

Y'all. Um, this is a really exciting conversation because I think it's. It's a tool in the finance toolkit that it's so many of you might have as an option as you go through this process, um, Susie and I met last year. I knew her name before I met her. She is literally spoken of as the absolute expert in this space.

Um, so it's so lucky to cross paths with her and really grateful for her taking the time to run through, [00:01:00] uh, the Rob strategy, which is an amazing opportunity for you to potentially tap into your retirement accounts without a taxable event to be able to use towards your, uh, your retirement. Um, acquisition.

So Susie's based here in Texas too. We're Texas girls. We're both suffering from something called cedar fever right now, which I've never heard of, but it's like this crazy cedar pollen that just makes you feel like you are. Have the worst cold ever. So we're both hanging in there. But, uh, I am kind of excited that she's going to be doing most of the talking today and hang in there with this cedar fever.

But Susie, thank you so much for being here. We're excited. I 

**Suzy:** am so pleased to be here. I want to shout out. Hello to Gil. How are you?

**Gil:** Great to put the face to the name. 

**Suzy:** Super. I, uh, really excited to share what I know about Rob's Plans. What's a Rob's Plan? It's a structure that allows you to access your retirement funds [00:02:00] without tax, without penalty, and you can use it as equity in your business. Most of my clients are going to use it as their down payment on their SBA 7a or 504 loan to acquire a business.

That's my most common guy. Now, I have another subset of folks that use solely retirement funds to get their business up off the ground. Some businesses, if they're a startup, let's say for example, non franchise, no brand, startup restaurant, In any city usa has a hard time getting a loan particularly an sba loan So sometimes my restaurant owners will come together solely with retirement funds.

I work for guidant financial. We're the big dog in the space Really proud to be here took me 18 years to get the guidance, but i've been here for three years now and Couldn't be happier. It is the largest provider of rob's plans the most compliant the most. Um, Well rounded I think and especially from the client [00:03:00] experience We've created help people create a lot of jobs in the u.

s marketplace, and i'm really proud of that. So a rob What is that? That sounds terrible It's an acronym stands for rollover as business startup, which is also inaccurate because it's This can be used for a startup, it can be used for an acquisition, and it can be used to recapitalize or add funds to an existing business.

So most of my prospects are folks that are looking to acquire, and they're going to combine that with SBA financing. And people ask me, what, what banks do this? All of them. I've been in the SBA lending space for 23 years now, and we work with just about any bank you can imagine, all across the country. So, why or when would you use a ROBS if you're short on the required down payment or the equity injection, or you may have [00:04:00] the equity injection or down payment in cash, but maybe you'd rather keep that cash away, keep it dry, if you will, and use these retirement funds that you're right now investing in other people's businesses.

There's an opportunity to invest those same dollars in your own business. Um, another thing that's becoming more and more common, especially since 2020, is additional post closed liquidity. What that means is you have more cash in the bank after your loan closes So it's the equity injection plus a little additional for um, Additional working capital the lenders want you to have money in the bank and most lenders Are going to provide you with some amount of working capital, but cash is king in any business And it makes everybody more comfortable if you can bring a little bit more and have some post closed liquidity.

Oh wow. I just went crazy there. Um, [00:05:00] some people don't want to wait on an SBA loan. I think that's a little short sighted. It's cheapest money out there today. Uh, great terms, but they just might want to do a ROBS only and not get a loan. Usually when they say they don't want to wait, it's because they don't, they're not qualified.

And, um, or the person doesn't like debt. Another way of saying, am I not sharing? Oh, my gosh. Thank you. Yeah. No worries. I was just jumping in to let you know. Thank you so much. Oh, remind me where the share button is. 

**Athena:** It is the big green button down at the bottom of the zoom. Yeah, that big one right there.

All good. I still haven't figured out zoom myself. That's why Ivanka do it. Okay, y'all 

**Suzy:** seen the slides 

**Athena:** now? Yeah, it's 

**Suzy:** just not in present mode. I'm gonna go back to the bank slide. We work with just about any lender, SBA lender. In the [00:06:00] country that you can imagine

here's the kinds of funds that can be used in a robs And you could use all of a plan a portion of a plan or multiple plans can be used doesn't make any impact on the timing of the process or the Cost of the process the minimum that we will work with the client is if they have fifty thousand dollars Or more to work with below 50 000.

This doesn't make a good economic impact, but we can go I'm not going to read this whole list. We can use just about any type of of qualified plan. The exception is a Roth IRA. Tax is already prepaid. There's no benefit to using a Roth IRA, so our plan doesn't accept them. Something else that's an inherited IRA, unless you inherited it from your spouse, and then you could use an inherited IRA.[00:07:00] 

If it's a 401k, 401k, 403b, thrift savings plan, something attached to your employer. It has to be prior employer. You have to leave your job, have already left your job, before you can access these funds. Um, that 50, 000 minimum, maybe the husband's got 25, 000 and the wife has 25, 000. We can bring them both together, it's one ROBS, one fee, one structure, and, and qualify for the ROBS.

So, this is what it looks like, this is what the structure is. 

**Joe:** Hey Susie, this is Joe, I have a quick question. Uh, you're saying that it has to be 50, 000 minimum in each account, or collectively if you're using a couple versions? Collectively. Okay. Thank you. Thanks. 

**Suzy:** So, the first thing we do is establish a C corporation.

The operating entity has to be a C corporation, because we're selling shares of stock, and we've got to have qualifying employer securities. So we [00:08:00] established the C corporation. Now a C corp is a standalone entity. It has its own tax return, form 1120. But in 2018, the corporate tax rate moved to a flat 21%.

So it's a very tax efficient entity type. We get that C corp established and then we're going to establish the 401k plan that we've established. What's special in a ROBS is what's in the 401k. The rules around 401k are contained within the ERISA law of 1974. So ERISA tells us what we can or cannot do in our 401ks.

Specifically, section 408E of ERISA tells us this. Through a 401k plan, a person can buy publicly traded stock. That's what we all typically do. They can also buy privately held stock of an active business that they're an owner operator of [00:09:00] and that would Be just about anybody buying a business, right? So we've established the corp we've established a 401k plan for that business that contains that specific if unique Language of the ERISA law.

This is very uncommon in day to day world, but in the SBA lending space, super common. Like I said, I've been doing this for 23 years. Same, same gig, same structure, same, uh, group of folks I work with. So now we've got the C Corp formed. We've got the 401k plan formed. We've guided our guy into opening the appropriate accounts, one for the corporation and in this example, one for the individual.

And we're going to call this individual pizza guy. Okay. And he has 95, 000 in an old retirement plan. Once we've got the entities established and we've guided him through opening the appropriate accounts, it's time to roll the money. So [00:10:00] he's going to send a rollover form to where his funds are now. We're going to help him through all of that.

And those dollars are going to roll from where they are into the new 401k plan. And that's a qualified rollover, plan to plan, which is why there is no tax. There is no penalty.

So now taking advantage of section 408e of ERISA, pizza guy is going to do through his 401k plan what we all do. He's going to buy stock through his 401k. But instead of buying stock in somebody else's business, this time he's buying stock in his own C Corp. So the dollars go from the old plan to the new plan, from the new plan into the corporate checking account.

That's where it becomes working capital, available for any purpose, to include leveraging against an SBA loan. The 401k [00:11:00] plan just bought stock in the C Corp, so it becomes a shareholder. And I have one more shareholder, pizza guy the individual. The fee for us to do all of this is 10, 000. is 4, 995, right?

We're gonna round that up to five grand for the rest of this call. The IRS requires that pizza guy pay the 5, 000 to us out of his own pocket. He's going to be reimbursed by the C Corp for that 5, 000, but not in cash. For this one fee, he's going to be reimbursed with an in kind stock exchange. So what that means is pizza guy pays us the five grand.

And he receives 5, 000 worth of stock attributed to himself individually in the amount of 5, 000. And let's imagine he rolled 95, 000 from his old plan into the new plan and invested all 95, 000 into a C Corp. Right there, that [00:12:00] shell of a C Corp, hadn't done anything yet, is worth 100, 000. And I have two shareholders.

Pizza Guy, the individual, owns 5 percent of this business. Representing the five grand he brought to the table. And Pizzaguy Inc. 401k for benefit of Pizzaguy, that's our plan, owns 95 percent representing the 95, 000 that came through the plan. It's Pizzaguy voting all these shares. 100 percent of shares are being voted by Pizzaguy, but the 401k plan is quite literally a shareholding.

Some of the rules around a ROBS is it's got to be a C corp. This is a 401k plan. That you must continue to make regular ongoing contributions for your own retirement benefits. Ongoing right the iris doesn't like to see the structure set up and being used for that one transaction Their attitude is if you got a plan, let's use it So you've got to continue to make [00:13:00] contributions for your own retirement into this plan in any movement of money between the corporation and the 401k plan whether you're putting money into the 401k from the corporation or if you're um buying shares away from the plan altogether All those activities have to be done at fair market value, and so occasionally it may require evaluation.

We don't require evaluation every year on the ROBS plans, but if something significant is happening, you're losing a partner, um, you're bringing more money and recapitalizing the business, you're adding a partner, there's some triggers that would require evaluation. We can handle that for you. In most cases here, guidance is about, I think, 1, 800 for us to do that.

The ROBS Our person who rolls their money in, person or persons, must be a W 2 employee of the C Corp. Only W 2 employees can be participants in a 401k plan. So you've got to draw a W 2 salary. Now what that is can be up [00:14:00] to you. Um, most people will keep it low in the beginning until they start getting some nice revenue from their business.

It's got to be an operating company. It's got to be providing goods or services. It's not for somebody to loan money, right? It's not an investment vehicle, anything like that. Your salary's got to be what the IRS calls reasonable compensation. And that's really the rule of thumb is what you would reasonably pay somebody else to do that job.

If it's 50, 000 a year, okay. If it's 100, 000 a year, okay. If it's 200, 000 a year, okay. Right? Whatever would be reasonable. And again, the 401k plan has to stay active.

So in this situation when you're getting an SBA loan, we have pizza guy Is a shareholder and the plant is a shareholder and when two shareholders are coming together in an SBA loan Everybody has to sign the guarantee with the SBA. The problem is 401k plants can't sign a guarantee So [00:15:00] the SBA has made allowances for this and the rule the what we have to support through our documentation is instead of the plan signing the guarantee Whoever rolled those dollars in and invested those dollars into the company, in this example it's Pizza Guy, has to sign the guarantee on behalf of the 401k plan.

So, we talked about this business being owned 95 percent by the plan and 5 percent by Pizza Guy. And day to day that doesn't have a huge impact, but let's imagine a buyer walks in the room and offers Pizza Guy a million dollars for his business. If his structure is still together, which is an option, we can talk about that some other time, um, selling his business for a million dollars gives him the opportunity to tax defer 950, 000 into his 401k, which would then roll out into an IRA because he just sold his business.

Pizza Guy, the individual, is going to receive 5 percent of those [00:16:00] sales proceeds, or in this example, 50, 000. That's what he's going to pay capital gains tax on. He just sold his business for a million dollars that's paying capital gains on 50, which I think is pretty strong. Do I have any questions?

**Athena:** That was great, Susie. Um, I think it's a really great overview. I had a few clarification points and things that I wanted to pull out, if that's okay. Um, great. And then just a reminder to everybody, we'll send you Susie's contact information afterwards. Um, I think Susie, are you comfortable sharing the slides?

I think you've done that. Yeah. Cool. Amazing uncle will follow up with you on that. So, um, on the, so we, we've talked about this before, but just a few points and then folks, if you have questions and follow up questions, like, start doing the raise hand thing and we'll, Let you, uh, jump in. But when you talked about the post close [00:17:00] liquidity, how much are you seeing lenders want from folks?

Like, in addition to their, their down payment amount, how much varies 

**Suzy:** on deal size. So I would say, you know, almost as much as their downstream. Really, so if they're down payments 200, 000, they're going to want to see 

**Athena:** that. Right. So, um, to de jargon eyes that for folks, it's basically, no, I I'm doing it because I use the jargon, but just in case the post close liquidity.

So, when, when you do alone. Uh, the banks are also going to be looking at, like, how much cash you have available to to support yourself and after you close. So, in addition to the money that you're using for your down payment. So, what you can use this strategy for is to increase the money that you have available, like, uh, please correct me if I'm wrong.

You could potentially do this strategy. To have the money available, [00:18:00] but not necessarily spend it or put it into the business. Is that correct? 

**Suzy:** Uh, you could. I mean, eventually you're going to be or it wouldn't be the point of using the strategy, but there is a natural stopping point. Um, when my clients are going through a business acquisition, we're talking about a Rob's plan.

The most frequent question I get is surrounding timing. When should I implement this? Yes. It's never too soon to get the education. Never too soon for that. But what I think the most prudent approach is, is A, make sure you have your deal together. You've got your LOI out, even as far as that. And you've got somewhat of a nod from your lender.

Then it's time to reach out. It takes us 30 days, in most cases, from engagement to dollars in hand. Ready to go to the closing table. Um, I want to get all those assignments done in that period of time. Sometimes holidays and present funerals and stuff can really gum things up a little bit, [00:19:00] as far as timing and getting the money moved.

But we work specifically with partners, um, Seattle Bank. Who helps our clients open their corporate checking account. They have a very great online interface that's super quick and super easy for our clients to own. So over the first kind of, I don't want to say temporary, but let's go ahead and say temporary corporate checking account.

That's what we're going to move the money to in the beginning. 

**Athena:** Got it. 

**Suzy:** For the 401k accounts, we're going to use another partner of ours with Fidelity, uh, Trainer Capital, that's going to help expedite the movement of the funds because he can do his things. I'm trying to get all my assignments done in 30 days.

And the thing that takes the longest is generally the movement of the funds. I'm going to once, you know, you talk to me as early as you want to, but then once we have a deal and we get to [00:20:00] that sweet spot that I'm talking about, where you've got an LOI or close to having an LOI out, You're working pretty, you know, your lender's pretty happy with everything.

Um, then you contact us. And at that point, after I've had a chance to qualify, you make sure that you do indeed qualify for a ROMS, I'm going to schedule a time for you to speak with a senior consultant. And they take the really deep technical dive on both the corporation, the 401k plan, the ongoing requirements, that whole very important, um, knowledge base.

And that's the person who takes my clients to the point of engagement. 

**Athena:** Okay, great. Um, so LOI signed, we've got a commitment letter from the bank. That's the time we contact Susie. Now, what about the folks that are currently in a W 2? So, I know there's some considerations around this has to be not an active Yeah, it is.

**Suzy:** So, in general, it's got to be prior employer. If it's, you know, your 401k with [00:21:00] your day job, or 43B, or 457 plan, or first savings plan, anything that happens to your employer. There are some exceptions. Let's say I worked for 20 years with Company A and participated in their 401k plan. And then I made a switch over to Company B.

And I rolled Company A's 401k into Company B's 401k. And now I'm participating in that plan. The portion I rolled in can generally come out in a ROMS. 

**Athena:** Interesting. Okay. And what about folks that are planning on leaving their job? Like, is that, is that something they could do? Like if they're like, no, I want to use the one that I'm currently at the job.

So what kind of timeline are they 

**Suzy:** going to consider for that? Or would rather, you know, approach this. And I have some people start saying, oh no, absolutely not. I'm not quitting my job. By the time the deal comes around, they are quitting their job because they want to do it. You know, this is where their passion is.

So it just depends on the circumstance. 

**Athena:** Yeah, I think most folks are wanting to be the [00:22:00] business owner and leave the W 2. So, how long does it take, say, like, if they're in a W 2 and they plan on quitting their job, being the business owner? So I think the best time 

**Suzy:** to engage, to sign their engagement documents with us is when they put in their two weeks notice.

**Athena:** Okay. 

**Suzy:** Perfect time. 

**Athena:** Great. Okay, so then working back from that. If if they need to close in 45 days, for example, they should be putting in their notice at least 45 days before the close 2 weeks late and then engage you knowing that after the 2 weeks notice, you still have 30 days to be able to roll it over into that.

That's right. Everybody 

**Suzy:** in the deal cycle needs to understand that he's a 30 day lead time. 

**Athena:** Right. And, but plus the two weeks with the notice. Is that correct? Yeah. So like 45 days minimum. Um, and ideally you're, you're not doing that before. You've definitely like signed the LOI. Things are looking good.

Lender likes it. We're feeling good about the process so far. 

**Suzy:** But it's never [00:23:00] too early to call Susie and just talk it out. Absolutely. Not need to just hash it out. It may not time to set up a senior. Consultant call, but it's never too early to talk to Susie. 

**Athena:** Um, great. So another thing that I wanted to chat about was the C corp structure and and just like, pull that out as a highlight.

So, most folks, if they weren't utilizing the Rob would probably want to do some sort of asset sale and S corp structure. So, there is going to be some additional tax considerations by having to form a C corp to be able to buy the business. Um, do you. Have an idea of how folks look at that or make a decision on whether it's worth bringing the 401k into the mix or not to, to, to then have it.

**Suzy:** So, you know, the first thing out of everybody's mouth generally is no, no, C corp, that's double taxation. First of all, it's not how many times you're taxed. It's how much you're paying in taxes. That's really the thing to be concerned about. But [00:24:00] the only way a C corp creates double taxation is by paying out dividends.

So people are used to S Corps and LLCs where you make distributions and you have to distribute it all out before the end of the year. And all the activity within your S Corp or LLC is flowing on to your personal tax return. Those are called flow through entities, right? And it's great if you're losing money, if you, you know, really crashing, because the losses in your business in the LLC or S Corp can be used to write off against your personal taxes.

What happens when you start making money? What happens when you make profit? The problem with the flow through is you're going to be taxed at your own personal tax rate. For every dime of profit in an LLC or an S corp, and I'm going to guess that your tax rate personally is way above the 21 percent only tax rate in a C corp.

[00:25:00] So it's very tax efficient. Dividends do cause double taxation. Dividends are post tax to the company. You pick it up on your personal tax return, you bet your bottom. That's double taxation. But A, you don't have to pay dividends. It's not required. You pay dividends some years and don't pay dividends other years.

That's fine. But, consider this. Let's talk about Pizza Guy for a minute. He's got 10 grand at the end of the year and he decides, I'm going to go ahead and pay out a dividend. Well, based on the shareholders, the plan is going to get 9, 500 and Pizza Guy is going to get 500 of which he's going to be double taxed on.

But he just put 401k plan in a way that most people don't have an opportunity to do. It's not a contribution. It's not a stock buyback. It's stacking your 401k's value based on the operation and, uh,[00:26:00] 

**Athena:** Yeah, exactly. So you're able to, to recoup that without a taxable event via the retirement fund. So it's not direct money in your, in your account. Now, I know I asked you about this when, um, when you did the presentation last summer, but I think it's probably a thing that comes up, right? It's like, well, what if I don't want to be paying.

You know, the 95 percent to my retirement account, is there a way to pay it down, get them out? You know, change the entity structure at some point, if I were to be able to pay my 401k shareholder back and then get 100 percent of the equity back myself. It 

**Suzy:** sure is. And this is a common approach for any deal that involves real estate.

Why? Because if we're using retirement funds. To buy a business, the C Corp [00:27:00] has to own everything, the operating business and the building. That is not the usual way to do a deal with real estate. Usually the owner would want to put that real estate in an LLC they own individually, and they can lease that space to their operating business as another line of income.

Genius. I get why you wouldn't want to have your real estate in your C Corp. Um, so those are the people that I see exiting out of their ROBs before they sell their business most commonly. Before they changed the tax rate in a C Corp, that was the primary reason why people wanted to get out of the C Corp because the tax rate would go so high.

So how do we get out of the ROBs? We've got to eliminate the 401k plan as a shareholder. How do we get rid of shareholders? We buy them out. Most of my clients that take this approach will use corporate dollars, deposit those dollars into the 401k plan at the current fair market [00:28:00] value, and that retires their shares down into corporate treasury.

So, as the 401k's percentage of ownership is going down, Pizza Guy's is going up as the other shareholder, right? And at whatever point in time the plan doesn't own any more shares of stock in the company, take the dollars in the plan, roll them out to an IRA, unhook and dissolve the 401k. Now we're no longer constrained to a C Corp.

We no longer are responsible for ongoing compliance costs. Which is 1, 800 a year for us to help you keep your plan compliant. And we can split the real estate out, put it back into an LLC. And that way you get that opportunity. That structure type is called an Eligible Passive Company or EPC slash Operating Company or OC.

So no EPC OC when we're using a ROBS. 

**Gil:** Susie, can I have a question about that specifically? I'm sorry.[00:29:00] 

Um, is there a minimum time that the secret has to exist before we can start buying out the 401k? 

**Suzy:** You know, that's a great question Gil. The IRS would like to see the structure intact for a minimum of three years unless you have a valid business reason to exit earlier. I've had one client in my career exit within a year.

No issues. 

**Gil:** Okay. And can the 401k be bought out on a regular basis? Like say I want to put a monthly sum into it or does it have to be a lump sum of buying it at a fair market value? 

**Suzy:** Well, so you need to be thoughtful about it because when we're buying the shares back, we've got to buy them at fair market value, right?

And this is a privately held business, so we can't Google it up to see what it's trading at. We've got to go through the exercise of an [00:30:00] appraisal or valuation to see what the fair market value is. I told you that's about 1, 800 here. You know, it depends on how many of those you want to want to pay for.

So I would, you know, I would do it in tranches, not drips and drabs. 

**Chris:** Okay, but that's just 

**Suzy:** me. Some people do do it drips and drops. Some people have, I had a, I had one deal. Uh, my client is in Houston and I had a, a lending buddy of mine call me, a referral partner, call me and say, Hey, Susie, this guy did his, robs in 2016 and his business is so successful now.

He needs real estate, but a warehouse on, does he still have to keep the real estate in the C Corp? I'm like, yeah, if it's a Rob's, it doesn't matter how long ago you did it. As long as a Rob's still in place. You've got to, uh, keep the real estate outside of the ROMs, or outside of, inside of the C Corp. And so my guy's like, we don't want to do that.

I'm like, I know, nobody wants to do that. He can buy his way out of, you know, you can buy the shares away from the [00:31:00] 401k. He's like, what's that gonna cost? I said, I don't know, ask your guy. Has he been buying shares back? How 401k plan own in his business? And it was only like 48, 000. It wasn't that much. And so what that lender did was loan him enough to exit out of his ROBs and then do the project as an EPCOC, putting the real estate in LLC and the uh, business as a C Corp still, 

**Gil:** because he was still in the ROBs.

That makes sense. Um, and Speaking of this, if there is, this is, this excludes the debt, right? So if I buy, if I take an SBA loan for, uh, 2 million, but fair market value for. Uh, the business is 2.1 million. Uh, then the 95 5 only only applies to that 100,000, right? 

**Suzy:** Say again? Yes. Yes. The, [00:32:00] the company's worth a hundred thousand.

The bank loan is for, 

**Gil:** so 2 million, let's just say that. It, it, it excludes the debt, right? So it just, it just, the fair market value of the company minus the debt.

**Suzy:** So the SBA comes in first, they take the first lean position. I'm not sure if that's what you're asking. 

**Gil:** No, no, I'm asking if I want to buy the 401k out at fair market value, right? It's minus the debt that's owed to the SBA. 

**Suzy:** No. Let me 

**Athena:** see if I can rephrase that for Gil. I think I know what he's getting 

**Suzy:** at.

**Athena:** Is it okay if I jump in and maybe try to translate? Okay. 

**Suzy:** No worries, 

**Athena:** I think I know where he was getting at because I, I had the same question. So let's say, um, that the business was valued at a [00:33:00] million. So the total enterprise value was a million. You take out a million dollar loan that the, um, retirement account contributed a 100, 000 thousand.

Yeah. Right? So then do they need to get bought out at, like, to, in order to buy back the shares from the 401k? Right. Do they need to be bought out at 100, 000 or the full million enterprise value? That's going to 

**Suzy:** depend on your enterprise. That's a great question. I'm sorry, Gil, it took me a minute. 

**Gil:** That's fine.

I didn't understand the question. 

**Suzy:** I switched to decaf and it's just not the same thing. I promise. It's not the same thing at all. Um, so pizza guy, back to him. He used essentially a hundred grand. It was 95, 000. And in most states, we're going to use a throw down number of 10 a share. I When we first capitalized the business through the robs, okay?

So, he's, you know, cooking along, cooking along, and for whatever reason, he has to have a valuation. And now he sees that his stock is worth 20 a share. [00:34:00] And it hits him. He says, Susie, are you telling me that I've got to spend 200, 000 to buy the shares back when I only put 100, 000 in? I'm like, yeah, that's what I'm saying.

But I'm also saying, if you had bought Apple stock at 10 a share, And it's through your 20 a share for having a happy conversation. That's the return on the investment within your 401k. That was the good vote that you made for you and your own business. 

**Gil:** Great. Okay. Perfect. Thank you so much. 

**Athena:** I have a few more questions for you.

Um, let's say somebody doesn't need this. To close a deal like they're, they've got enough equity injection and personal liquidity, but they take over the business and they would like access to more working capital. Is this only something that can be done at time of close or are they able to access this after?

They buy the [00:35:00] business if they, if they maybe want to like reinvest in the business or, you know, buy additional fleet of trucks if they need it or something. My 

**Suzy:** guy has an auto repair shop. He's already tapped out on his SBA loan. He's doing great. He needs another lift. Those things are expensive. We may use his retirement funds to add funds to or recapitalize his existing business.

You know, there may need to be some structure changing if, you know, what type of entity he was in to begin with. There's going to have to be an evaluation because we have to know what the fair market value is. I have a, uh, a marine painting business in Galveston, Texas. owned by two brothers, and they got seriously in debt with their payroll tax, like 300, 000.

And so each brother rolled in 200, 000 into their 401k and recapitalized their existing business. So not only settling the debt, but also having a little bit extra [00:36:00] work and capital. Um, yes. 

**Athena:** Okay, amazing. That's a, that's a great tool for people to know, because I think a lot of folks are concerned like, well, what about the J curve?

Right? Like, we don't know what the J curve is going to look like after we take it over. So, even if you don't need your retirement account to close on the deal, it's something for you to think about, like, this might be an option for you. If you feel like you, you want to see your opportunity 

**Suzy:** for 

**Athena:** growth.

**Suzy:** Another thing I heard a lot was people that have bought a franchise, let's say it's in the pet business, right? And now they're in, the build out took forever and they're just dying to, you know, they open their doors, but they understand that now the franchisor has deals on inventory. if you're ready to pay, right, for a volume deal.

And they want to be able to take care of those opportunities. And so they added money through the ROM. So there's tons and tons of creative, [00:37:00] creative uses for ROMs. Even though it's kind of a strict structure, there's lots of flexibility around 

**Athena:** it. Here's another question for, well, I have two more questions for you.

So is there a minimum amount of time that the funds need to be in the pre existing 401k before someone can use it?

Like, does it need to be seasoned and that, like, if they, if they were contributing a year ago or whatever, like, is there a certain amount of time? It needs to be in there. No, great. And then, um, let's say someone buys just the business. They're leasing the real estate from the owner. Real estate becomes available.

Is that also something that you can use a Rob's for to like purchase the real estate after an acquisition? 

**Suzy:** His Rob's still own 48, 000 in his business story. That's what he was doing was buying real estate to put a warehouse on it for his business. So, and then in that, in that situation, Oh, sorry, 

**Athena:** I'm talking over you.

Go ahead. You can 

**Suzy:** reanalyze the business, same thing, just adding funds. To the [00:38:00] business for these, you know, needs that you didn't know you had. So, 

**Athena:** in that, in that, in that example, where it was specifically for a real estate purchase, it wouldn't be able to be a separate entity. It would need to be part of yeah.

Okay. The business itself, because it is considered a business investment, not a real estate investment. 

**Suzy:** Just about anything that would qualify for an SBA loan qualify for a ROBS. No businesses, no strip clubs, no churches. Um, no, uh, car lot paid by the week. We're going to finance you as you go. None of that kind of stuff.

**Athena:** Great. Um, and then folks that are listening, if you have any questions, uh, you know, put your hands up and jump in. I, I find this endlessly fascinating. So, Susie, you are spoken of as like the expert in the space. You've been doing it for. Couple of decades now. [00:39:00] So every, everyone here also knows Wendy, uh, also, and Susie is too.

Wendy recommends as well. Just so y'all know from live Oak bank. Can you talk us through like, what, what have you seen people like first time buyers? And whether it's related to Rob's or just general, cause you're in general or, or when it's related to Rob's, like what all of these folks are first time business buyers.

So, what are you, what have you seen in all of your years of expertise that people get wrong when they go through this process, Rob's related or otherwise, that would be great for them to 

**Suzy:** in general folks that are pursuing an SBA loan. are not responsive quickly enough. I know it's a pain in the butt.

Your lender is going to ask you for a million things a million different times in a million different ways. But the quicker you can be Johnny on the spot, the quicker you're going to get your money. It's that simple. [00:40:00] Be responsive. In a robbed environment, the biggest mistake I've seen people made over my career is not maintaining ongoing compliance.

And it's brutal. I worked for another provider for 18 years. And we did a terrible job of protecting our clients from, you know, forgetting to do what they're supposed to do. At Guided, it's an automated system. It's so simple and nobody falls through the cracks. That's really, really important is maintaining compliance.

The biggest question I get also besides timing is what happens if I fail? What happens if my business fails? The first thing I have to say about that is don't talk like this in front of your lender. Don't talk like this there. I said, but you know, not every business is going to be successful. On the national average, a startup, 95 percent of them are going to fail.

And it's not my [00:41:00] client's experience. My clients are way more successful than the national average, and I attribute that completely to age. They've been around long enough to require retirement funds. They've got some sense about them, right? They've been in business, they know what they're doing. But if you did have to shut your doors, I had a guy 100 years ago, bought a mattress store and put it in the mall.

What? He was out of business in six months.

What happened and what would happen in any case is any assets owned by the company would be liquidated to cash. Any cash generated from that exercise would be pushed up into the retirement plan, effectively buying back as many shares of stock as possible. Any dollars in the plan, they're going to roll out to an IRA.

We're going to dissolve everything. It'll be a bad day and a harsh reality, but Uncle Sam's not going to come knocking. Hey, remember those tax and penalties you didn't pay? [00:42:00] Now I want that money. It's not a tax consequence like that. 

**Athena:** It's a great thing to know. Um, when, when it comes to the, like, let's say there was, Uh, you know, uh, a situation like that, I'm assuming SBA has first pick over the 401k personally.

Yeah. So the 401k might get what's left. If anybody, 

**Suzy:** nobody can get into your 401k now, if you've got liquidity in your company, yes, they can take your equipment and liquidate it themselves. They can take your real estate and sell it off if they want to. But what's ever within the 401k, the IRS can't get into that.

**Athena:** Okay. And then, but like the, the, the business assets, what's left after the SBAs? picked it apart, then maybe the 401k can, can get something 

**Suzy:** back, 

**Athena:** but the SBA is going to have first rated that. Absolutely. Every time. Can you talk a little bit more about the, you said being [00:43:00] responsive. Why, why did you pick that out?

What are you seeing? Like, what impact does that have for people not being responsive? 

**Suzy:** Especially when you're engaging with us, we need your statements uploaded. Um, we're going to be sending information to you with instructions to do X, Y, and Z. Send that back to us. It's mainly in the setup period that I see all this frustration Because we promised 30 days and we do our damndest to stick to that 30 days But you know, I tell my guy on a wednesday You need to go ahead and liquidate the cash And he doesn't make that call until the following tuesday because monday was martin luther king day That's added nearly seven days to our whole process.

So we're going to give you the tips and tricks to make it go as quickly as possible But again, it's generally surrounding the movement of the funds and uh, that's where the heartache lies in most of these deals Right, and then we've collected it now that we've got seattle bank and trainer [00:44:00] Involved it's almost a it's a perfectly automated system.

It's beautiful. So That's nice. That's fantastic. Um, 

**Athena:** and, you know, these folks haven't been through the process yet, but a client that have closed and like, going through the lending process, like you said, the lenders will ask for the same thing a million different ways a million times over. And you're like, but I've gotten this already.

So, um, there's a lot 

**Suzy:** on your desktop with all your documents be ready to send them as many times as you need to. 

**Athena:** Yeah, it's a, it's a wild process and every lender handles it completely differently, has a different process and so you might, I have one client that spoke to seven different lenders and had to go through that, like the uploading and everything to, to finally get, um, 

**Suzy:** did they get their loan?

**Athena:** They did. Yeah. Um, yeah. And, um, They, they had a, you know, originally it was like a customer concentration issue, but it was structuring a forgivable note. They were able to overcome [00:45:00] the issues and get a lender to lend to them. So it was cool. Um, I is, is anyone that's watching, do you have any questions for Susie?

You can ask questions about your personal situation too, since we have her, we've got some time. Um, is anyone thinking this might be a play that they use? Oh, I heard a voice. 

**Joe:** I have a question. Yeah, this is Joe. Hey, Susie. Thanks for the time and info today. Pretty helpful. Um, I don't profess to be the smartest man.

I need you to specifically tell me. Clearly all the money that we can use towards the robs has not been taxed yet. So it goes into the 401k vehicle, into the court, the C corp, right? When is the tax event? 

**Suzy:** Okay, so the corporation is going to have income, which is super duper, that's what we want. It's going to have expenses, and your W 2 salary is a part of that.

What's left over is going to pay 21 percent tax on its profit. But I think what you're [00:46:00] asking me is what happens to a lot of money that ends up in your 401k or IRA at the end of the time. 

**Joe:** Well, I'm actually asking what, when does the money you're putting into the business get taxed? Does it just gradually get taxed?

**Suzy:** You have a tax return every year. 

**Athena:** Do you mean as, as, like, um, as, so I think he's speaking about retirement. 

**Suzy:** When you reach the age of, I think it's up to 73 now, used to be 72 and a half, it keeps getting older. When you reach that age, you are to take what's called required minimum distributions from your retirement plans.

The government requires it of you. You get taxed at that time. You don't have to take out the whole enchilada. It's an algorithm that tells you how much you have to take out. So it might be 2%, it might be 4%, I don't know, I'm not that old. Um, but some of my clients that are in a Rob's are like, wait a minute.

When I get to be that old, and I still plan on being in business, What if [00:47:00] I don't have the cash to pay myself the required minimum distribution? That's another time you could pay yourself in kind. So you could get stock in the company instead of cash, if that was necessary. I've never had anybody implement it above age 73, so I don't know.

But the growth or the gains within the company that get diverted into the 401k plan, those gains you're going to pay when the money comes out. 

**Joe:** Okay. I think that answers it then. All right. Thank you. 

**Athena:** You're 

**Suzy:** welcome. 

**Athena:** So Joe, one of the ways that I, I help wrap my head around this is like, if you consider your 401k plan, the same as an investor, right?

Like, so you have to, they're, they own a percentage of your business, so you have to pay them as if they were an investor that owns a percentage of your business and then the tax on the retirement funds themselves. It's like, when you take them as retirement. 

**Joe:** Okay. 

**Athena:** Does that answer your question? It's a great question.[00:48:00] 

**Joe:** Yeah, it makes sense. And just curious how that worked. And it sounds like it's kind of what would be expected, right? As when you take that money out. 

**Athena:** Yes. So, you know, like, for most of you, you probably have 401ks where you don't get a lot of, like, Choice in the direction of the investments, so I kind of picture this as like a self directed 401k, right?

It is. 

**Suzy:** It's what it is. You're just investing it into 

**Athena:** your own business versus the S and P 500. so you pay it back to the 401k, like, just like the S and P 500 or any other investments that your 401k might be into is paying. Uh, the, the, you know. Um, gains back into the 401k account and that's how your 401k account is growing.

It's it's a self directed account that you are deciding to invest in your own business, but you do have to pay it. Like, if it owns 20 percent of your business and you take distributions, then 20 percent of your distributions need to go back into the 401k.[00:49:00] 

**Chris:** Hi, Susie, this is Chris. You mentioned, um, I know you had a bunch of accounts and at the proper time, alas, but. You did call out IRAs. Um, would you mind expanding as to, because I do have, um, context. I do have to consolidate. I have probably like five or six of these things that some IRAs, one or at least one is inherited, you know, we can get into it later.

But can you maybe talk a little bit more about as to, Okay. Maybe why IRAs are maybe not welcomed if, did I misinterpret that? 

**Suzy:** You can use IRAs, you absolutely can use IRAs. Tons and tons of people use IRAs. You can't use a Roth IRA. Ah, understood, understood. Tax is already prepaid there, so there's Yeah, because that 

**Chris:** prepaid the tax.

Yeah, yeah, yeah. 

**Suzy:** And you cannot use an inherited IRA. Unless it's inherited from a spouse. 

**Chris:** [00:50:00] Yeah, so for me, yeah. Um, no, that, it was, and then follow up to that, um, I think, I always think of, so you said you can't use, assuming you, I could move, let's say, if you, your current employer allows you to move, exit into another, let's say I move it to an IRA, that would then be applicable to this, right?

**Suzy:** Yes, and so what you, You want to ask your employer and actually want to ask your plan administrator. So on your statement should be a person's name. 

**Chris:** Let's say I have, but actually this I'll selfishly ask. So I have a number of them, but one that has a decent amount of funds. There is a fidelity. So arguably Fidelity allows me that in this plan agreement to have it my current employer to roll over to I don't know.

Let's say this or like a Betterment 

**Suzy:** [00:51:00] That's called being able to roll out of your current employers 401k or whatever Type of plan is an in service Distribution and it's pretty rare, but sometimes it happens Usually larger publicly traded companies will allow you to roll out while you're still employed, but it's not, not that common.

Usually comes down to you're going to have to quit your job or have been terminated, separated somehow. Okay.

**Chris:** These are really 

**Athena:** great questions. Susie, I have one. Uh, you're, you're using a phrase I'm not familiar with, and this is probably because I spent 10 years in the UK learning all the retirement options there. Um, what's you said? You can't use an inherited IRA. What does that mean? So 

**Suzy:** it's crazy. The IRS in some circumstances of life view a husband and wife as one unit.

An IRA can not, let's see, an IRA has to stay attached to[00:52:00] 

the original earner.

And when that earner passes away, if it's his spouse that inherits it, the IRS is looking at them as one unit. Oh, that's the same earner. She can continue to use that. That's the difference there. If it's, you know, if it's your husband, your wife, you can use that. If it's your mom, your dad, your aunt. Can't use it in ROBS.

It's frustrating. Okay, but 

**Athena:** they, they, they could. So, so if you have an IRA yourself, you can leave it to your son, for example. But the son wouldn't be able to use that towards ROBS. Yes. Got it. Okay, great. [00:53:00] Um, does anyone know? Oh, Chris, I see you. I'm going to add because 

**Chris:** I've been through it. It has to do with how the IRS looks at you.

And, uh, so, you know, you can be married while single or you're filing jointly. Right? So you, you're a tax unit. You both had a tax ID. It's, it's, it's an essence that your kid would be in this hypothetical would be a separate, you know, tax ID tax, you know, different taxes. So it's like you get double dip in essence.

**Athena:** Thanks, Chris. I appreciate that. Chris. Yeah. Um, So, anyone else have any questions for Susie? This has been super helpful. Um, and, you know, exciting opportunity, like, at various stages, right? Like, using it as part of the, the purchase and or knowing that that's that's a element of safety after and or. An element of like, well, I want to invest in the business and I don't want to take out more loans or debt or whatever.

And I see an opportunity to scale it. So I can, like, [00:54:00] invest in myself. So I think there's a couple of different ways in which folks can think about this as future business owners, um, as a really exciting way and to grow your investment alongside that. I heard I heard a voice. It sounds like somebody else might have a question.

**Joe:** This is Joe. It's clearing my throat probably, but I was going to ask, did Susie put her contact information up or can she share that real quick? 

**Athena:** Oh, yeah, we're going to we'll drop it in the channel as well. Okay. Right after this. So you have it. We're also going to put the recording and we'll grab Susie's slides to, um, so that you can reach out to her immediately because.

She's, you know, she's really helpful with their time. There's her email address for you. She just dropped it in the chat. Um, and, you know, if you want to speak specifically about your situation where your accounts are, et cetera, she's, she's, I'm speaking for her, but I think she's more than happy to have a conversation with you so that at the right time, you're prepared to [00:55:00] know what you can do.

**Suzy:** That's right. 

**Athena:** Thank you. Well, so fantastic, Susie, thanks for working through the cedar fever too. It is real. I've never experienced this before. I was like, wait, trees do this to us? Like, what's happening? I don't know. 

**Suzy:** I come from Galveston County where I was at the beach. It's nothing like this. It's crazy here.

I've never had this kind of allergy or whatnot. 

**Athena:** No, it's, it's wild. I, but I do remember when I was much younger and I would go to San Antonio in the summer. Like, when I, when I traveled around the pollen would start eating at my skin. So, Texas has some. Crazy wicked wild. Cool. I don't think anyone else has any questions.

So I appreciate y'all attending so much 

**Suzy:** and look forward to another opportunity to meet again. 

**Athena:** Amazing. Thank you so much. Susie. We'll talk to you soon. [00:56:00] Thanks everyone.
