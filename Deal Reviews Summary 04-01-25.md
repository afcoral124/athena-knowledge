  Hello.

0:04 - AcquiMatch Team
  Hey. Hello.

0:09 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Awesome work on the update, Luke.

0:12 - Luke Gillespie
  Thanks. Sorry. I didn't know I went a little over time.

0:18 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  You're passionate and dropping some really, really good information.

0:22 - Luke Gillespie
  So I think it's important that we share that stuff.

0:26 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So thanks for putting in the extra effort and energy and researching it and clearly you'd practiced it and thought about it.

0:32 - Luke Gillespie
  So I thought it was a great update. Thanks. Thanks for the opportunity to do it. Yeah.

0:39 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  I love the thoughts at the end too. know, like how people could consider this and lowering the SC and having conversations with the brokers.

0:47 - Luke Gillespie
  So I thought that was a really great way to wrap it up. Yeah, thanks.

0:52 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Welcome. David and Ryan, what do you think? know you've heard that before.

0:59 - AcquiMatch Team
  Good job, man.

1:05 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, it'll be interesting see what happens, but I mean, honestly, like the media just scares people all the time and the people are so scared to buy business as it is, you know, it's like literally something's always going to be happening politically or whatever, you know, so we can alleviate fears and be like, it's part of business, like, yeah, administration is going to change every four years, you want to do this for 10, you're going to go through three administration changes, you know, over the next 10 years.

1:36 - Luke Gillespie
  So, yeah, the media since nationalizes things so much, it's horrible.

1:42 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Well, they do have to control people, you know, if people are afraid, then they shut down, they're controllable, they're not going to make decisions, you know, and they like, holding off on on doing things or making decisions or becoming a business owner, like, that's what they want, you know, like, business being a  You're like, you make decisions from a very different place when you're a business owner. You don't want to be controlled when you're a business owner.  Right? um, anyways, I won't get any into any of those discussions because I knew we're running late. So, um, I want to try to wrap up on time because I have to jump in my car and drive for three and a half hours to Dallas to get to us and bash.  So, um, yeah, and I've got two phone calls scheduled. was like, I'm not realizing it's scheduled myself from 8 a.m.  to 8 p.m. on my calls today. I like doing phone calls from the car because it's a good way to pass the time.

2:39 - Luke Gillespie
  So, um, cool.

2:43 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So, okay. We had a good chat yesterday about where energy and focus is going to be and where to get the most out of all the energy and effort that we're putting in.  I know you haven't had a huge chance to react to all of that, but, um, you know, that's the kind of lens.  I'm going to continue to look through and have us all kind of looking through on these calls and how I can support you as being that reminder of, yes, we want to get our commitments made, but what's important is clients making offers on deals.  So what a cool thing to have a buyer's club. We're like not one, but two of our clients are looking at two great deals right now that they're potentially making offers on.  So keep giving me more of that great content to work with and awesome. Ryan, where would be helpful for you all today to start?  Because I think I've got a pretty good sense of what's happening. How can I be of help or service to you guys today?

3:46 - AcquiMatch Team
  I mean, for me, I'm okay. It's kind of the beginning of the month. Usually we're like halfway through. We're like, this client needs attention, this one doesn't.  We're kind of not in that position right now because we're at a fresh start.

4:02 - Luke Gillespie
  I can feel some time if you need anything.

4:06 - AcquiMatch Team
  Well, if it's important, right? She's got a lot of things to do. So we're just trying to make sure that we're going to speak about things that it's things that you guys need help on.  Do you do you look feel like you need inside or help from the feed on anything?

4:19 - Luke Gillespie
  Um, I had a couple kind of non deal specific things I've been wanting to ask. Then there's a couple of deals I could talk about as well.

4:25 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  And then if you want to update, I could update you on a whole bunch of items I've been working on.  Oh, yeah, why don't you tell us your questions and we can go from there. It might spark off some light bulbs and other areas and then Ryan before we round off.  Let's just have a quick combo on performance notes. Hopefully I didn't. I think I captured the essence of what he wanted to do on Thursday.  But, um, yeah, cool.

4:48 - Luke Gillespie
  ahead, Luke. Okay. So, uh, can I share my screen, please? To keep it deal specific first. Let's talk about this deal.
  SCREEN SHARING: Luke started screen sharing - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/265286565?timestamp=298.521527  Um, was that $10 million. dollar IT company from Gil, we we had said, Oh, how much liquid capital? How much 401k home equity does Gil really have?  So we sent David to go digging, doing the hard work, doing the good work. And he showed us up with this sheet.  So $10 million asking price and we're seeing 170 to 180k liquid funds for Gil. He has 200k in his 401k and can take a loan for an additional 100k.  $1 million home equity, over 800 credit score. And he's going to be called for 2.4 million.

5:33 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So we wanted to bring this up to you to see your thoughts on how should we think about this for a $10 million business?

5:41 - Luke Gillespie
  it's going to be, okay, 10% equity injection, $10 million, let's say best case scenario, we get that seller note.  So 5% of $1 million, $500,000 if he uses all of his liquid funds, liquidates his entire 401k and takes the home, or maybe he just gives a HELOC.  Um, I don't know where you're Are you thinking about this, I mean, this is surrounding the conversation of not letting deals be too big for our clients, trying to find a way to make it work.  And this one is just it's a really big deal.

6:10 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So we want to bring it up to you. It's interesting. He says he has those kinds of assets and was only pre qualified for 2.4.  So I wonder if the home was part of it, he might be in a, I don't know if it's in New York, New York might be a homestead state, in which case maybe that's informing the pre-qual, if you had a million in home equity, he could potentially pull in a HELOC.  When we visited the, so one of the important things to, sorry, keep it, keep it there because, oh, okay, you're going to his fire profile.
  ACTION ITEM: Call Wendy re Gil's 2.4M pre-qual vs 1.2M assets. Understand discrepancy. Learn about lender processes/decisions. - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/265286565?timestamp=407.9999

6:52 - Luke Gillespie
  I'm pretty sure he's in New Jersey, New York, his location. Sadness.

6:59 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  I hope so. Ryan, I would almost like ask Wendy where the pre fall came from, like where the amount came from because it's pretty low for all of our clients.  like first get an understanding from her own where she saw that either there's a risk or there's a lack of assets.  Then also what we need to understand, did we get capture somewhere, whether he's open to investor capital or raising investment?
  ACTION ITEM: Check sales/onboarding calls for Gil's openness to investors. Document for all clients if not easily accessible. - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/265286565?timestamp=437.9999

7:30 - David R
  No, I believe he didn't say anything about it.

7:34 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay, he might have in the sales calls. one thing that we should be doing, this is great. I think we should probably do this for all the clients if you're not already to just get a little audit of like what they said that they have.  And then in the sales calls, I ask them how they feel about investor money, that sort of thing. because I  do a lot of the discovery in the sales calls and then the first onboarding call is kind of rehashing some of that.  So it would have been covered at some point likely if I was following the script to a T. If that's a pain in the  to get it, I mean we should probably do it for all the clients anyway to just know like are they open to a investor yes or no because if they are then you'll raising some money for a good deal for something that he has experience and isn't too far out of the question it's whether he wants to or not some people don't want anyone in the business or don't want to like give away any of the equity so we kind of need to get that.  Now this is one of those things where I used to do temp checks all the time when I was looking at deals for clients and I don't think we'd do that necessarily anymore where we do a temperature check with them it's like hey this amazing opportunity it ticks all the boxes  you. It's a little bit bigger, but we think with your background experience, the way the business is performing that, you know, an investor check would make it happen.  Are you open to an investor helping, you know, write the equity check on SBA? Does that all make sense?  I rattled a lot off at you, but so, you know, there's a couple different things. if he said he was opening investor money in the past and we love this business and he's the things an investor is going to look for is this person investable.  So it's IT services, that skills background, so having an operator, like investing in an operator that has done this before is a lot easier than if we put a pair of salon.  You know, all. like we're saying a $10 million like Air Salon group, then an investor might be like literally don't see the connection here.  So does that make sense in terms of like investability of the client? If it's they've got the experience, that would be fairly easy for them to raise investment.  Now we need to understand if they're even open to that. If they don't want to work with an investor at all, then putting something in front of them where they might need an investor to write an equity check.  But with SBA, you can bring investors as long as they're under 20%, they don't make a personal guarantee. So it's unlikely that they're going to be giving away more than 20% of the business for that reason.  So they'd still have majority control. There's ways to write it into the investor agreements that they're silent, they don't have direction, blah, blah, But likely you'd want to bring an investor that could offer insight advice guidance that doesn't want to run these kinds of...  businesses anymore but has has done so in the past. All right, that's a lot of words. What are what did you guys take away as the next steps from all of that?

11:10 - Luke Gillespie
  Again, I can do a temperature check with Gil. First, I'm going to make sure that the deal is still available as this was kind of a we've been working on this for a while, but now we know we're better prepared for the next time.  But I'm going to talk to the broker see if it's still available. I'll bring it up to Gil on the channel temperature check, tell them the details without breaking any NDA's, tell them it's a $10 million business, you may have to bring in an investor, but it is a perfect fit for your experience, IT business, and I'll figure I'll even just include the listing link and say, look, I can show you this without disclosing breaking the NDA, right?  How are you feeling about us pursuing this further? Are you a no-go to investors?

11:46 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Word it a lot more. What do we need to do first before we do a temperature check?

11:53 - David R
  I'm going to check the sales call just to see if he mentioned something about being open to investors.
  ACTION ITEM: Update all client profiles w/ investor openness info. Make easily accessible. - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/265286565?timestamp=713.9999

12:00 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, so we need to check all the onboarding calls and the original sales calls and first confirm. And we should probably do that if we haven't, if we don't have it very easily accessible on all of the client-steel profiles, we should know if they're open to investors or not.  Because if they're not, then putting something in front of them that they're unlikely to get done on their own is a problem.  What else did I talk about research wise that we need to do and probably understand that's not aligning with the financials that y'all just put in front of me?

12:34 - Luke Gillespie
  No, equity with a Wendy from SBA prequalification.

12:40 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So it doesn't make sense if somebody actually has like 1.2 million in assets, that they're only getting a 2.4 prequal.  So there's something there that we're not seeing or understanding.

12:58 - Luke Gillespie
  Makes sense.

12:59 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So then what? What might we suggest?

13:08 - Luke Gillespie
  Ryan, would you want to bring it up on a call with Gil and ask him about that? Or maybe you should ask Wendy.  I don't really interact with Wendy like that. That's what I would think.

13:20 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  If you were like, let's, let's use the managing upwards tool. What would you, what would you do here?

13:27 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah, I would ask Ryan to talk to Gil and Wendy about it.

13:33 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Well, I would go Wendy first, right? Because Gil might not know the reason why he was pre-qualified for that.  But yeah, like, hey, Ryan, I found a bigger business. Gil's only pre-called for 2.4, but he's got a bunch of assets.  Like, would you be open to chat with Wendy about that?

13:50 - Luke Gillespie
  Or you can have, I could ask Ryan to just introduce me to Wendy and all talk to her over email or something.

13:57 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, that's one option. We might want to keep the relationship. But that's exactly why you can suggest, like, hey, could you talk to Wendy or if you don't want to do that, would you be willing to make an introduction to me or whatever?

14:09 - Luke Gillespie
  So like giving some options and how to get to the bottom of what's going on there.

14:16 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  you know, that is something that when it came through, it was like that didn't check out. Like, I didn't understand that and there might be something in there that she's seeing that we didn't get wind up like, Oh, New Jersey is a homestead state.  So they can't count the house as part of the assets or something about the way that he interviewed with her was a concern, in which case we still need to know that, right?  Because Gil, when he finds a business is going to have to go out and sell himself some lenders.

14:49 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah.

14:50 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Um, and Ryan's working on now building more relationships with the lenders and kind of understanding their individual processes and stuff like that.  So it's an opportunity for him. to learn more about their process and what they look at how they decide, you know, pre-qualism, that sort of thing too.

15:08 - Luke Gillespie
  Yep.

15:10 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Cool. Then if it's timely, you know, so this is all kind of like everybody all at once. you know what in the future, what can we be doing to get ahead of these kinds of questions?

15:25 - Luke Gillespie
  I already have that document prepared for every time, for all their assets.

15:30 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, assets and like understanding. So when, when you get a pre-qual, then Ryan can chat with Wendy and be like, hey, what, what factors were part of your decision here that we should know about?  Was there, because she used to do that with me. She'd be like, I'm really worried about so and so, you know, and actually I should, I can tell you guys that as long as you don't communicate it to the clients.  But sometimes we need to have this conversation despite them to understand what's going on. With Jason specifically, she was very concerned because he seemed like he was submitting.  that wanted to buy a business and then go, you know, like not be involved. And he kept telling her, like, I don't want to be involved in the day-to-day.  She's like, that's a huge risk to me. So they pre-qualify people based on not only their assets, but their background and like what kind of risk profile that they think people have for that person.

16:21 - Luke Gillespie
  Interesting. That's why Jason's was so low and he has assets like rental properties and stuff and interesting. And then like two of our like some of our clients that are like the best talkers like Joe and Steve probably interviewed really well.

16:36 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  that's when they got that nine million prequel. Well, in assets too and state dependencies, right? if the bank can put a lien on the house that's considerably more assets, but in homestead states, like Texas, you cannot as a bank put a lien on the house.  So it's less assets available for them to come after should somebody default on the lawn. So we can only theorize and pasteurize  as much as we can but ultimately like Everlander makes a different decision but here's an opportunity for us all to grow as a team now that we have more people more bandwidth Ryan speaking to lenders more like you know when we get a new client let's make sure we understand our financial situation and let's like document whether they're open to investors or not and let's get a read from Wendy on why she made that decision yeah and then make sure that that gets shared amongst the team in some way so you guys can chase Ryan and be like hey when you chatted what was that information and and document it right um so like as a team how do we make everybody's lives easier but also get the information that we need so all of us are operating from the same understanding yeah yeah sounds like a plan we'll work on that cool was that your question then about whether he do a deal that big or did you want to talk more about should you put something like that in front of him yeah no that was

18:00 - Luke Gillespie
  that was all I wanted to ask. we have been going forward from here, see what he said on the sales halls, do a temperature check if he's interested to investors and go forward from there.

18:09 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  You need to be careful with the temperature check. So I want you to run it past Ryan before you do it.  And how you position it matters. So Gil gets terrified of things, right? So it's like, hey, we have this opportunity.  We think you're a great fit for it. It might require you to do some investment. If he already said he was opening investment, no temperature check needed if you think it's a good business.

18:35 - Luke Gillespie
  Okay.

18:36 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Right. But like how you position the really big scary things matters. So you've seen this with a couple clients on these big deals that get worried.  So it's not just putting it right up in front of them. It's it's making sure that we're making them feel okay about something that big and that we agree that it's something that they can handle.

18:59 - Luke Gillespie
  Yep.

19:00 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So that that would be in consultation with Ryan on how to position that. Something I wanted to bring up that I saw I was revisiting all the slack channels.  So Jason said he doesn't like compliance. Do you remember what your response to him was about that?

19:22 - Luke Gillespie
  I pulled up right now, but I remember I said, yeah, that's, I said, yeah, that's understandable. could be difficult to deal with.  Yeah, I believe that's what I said. Compliance can be very annoying to work with. Thank you for the Thank you for the feedback.  We'll incorporate it into your search blowing forward. We won't show you another compliance company.

19:46 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Well, what's, what's one of the things that we do here?

19:53 - Luke Gillespie
  Match make.

19:55 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Right, and what do match makers do sometimes?

19:58 - Luke Gillespie
  Push back with the clients on. Push back. on the client with what they're thinking sometimes.

20:03 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Right, or just get to understand why they felt that way, right? So you, the whole team, to get one right about that is the whole team's effort for an entire half of month, right?  there was something in there that you thought was a understanding why or pushing back on it, and then saying, we'll change the deal boxes as result of that.  need to have more of a consultative approach and dive into that a little bit more. So I, at that point, I would be like, if you thought this is a  great business, Jason should consider this, then I would be having a conversation with Ryan, have Ryan go back and or be like, tell me more about that, or can you fill Ryan in on that aspect.  um ask questions about it don't just take it at face value and update the deal box right because Jason keeps doing this  where he changes his mind every two seconds and also why is compliance an issue I didn't even understand that from the from his response is he just like batting something away that is actually a good business or can be overcome with like maybe he needs a higher somebody that's an advisor that comes in once a quarter and looks at compliance I don't know but what we don't want to do and I don't ever let people just turn down a  write up there's so much energy and effort and that goes into it and it's like no no no no you don't like you need to at least have a conversation with me at the very least on to why that's not a good fit for you and what your issues are with compliance so I'm not saying you did anything wrong because it's good to have good customer service and stuff but just remember like somebody's like I want a six foot four blonde with blue eyes  and a trust fund and works in finance. And it's like literally if you look at the percentage of people like this is ridiculous and it's not going to be a good bet.

22:08 - Luke Gillespie
  You're going to be totally unhappy, you know?

22:09 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So you go to a matchmaker because I'm going to be like, I know you want to just explore person in finance, you know, with a trust fund.  But I think you should consider this five foot 10 brunette who works in your home services. And you guys have the same personality and your humor is great.  And I think you've really got to walk, go talk to them, right?

22:34 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah, exactly.

22:37 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So it's a huge energy expenditure to put a write-up out for somebody to just bat it away without a conversation.

22:45 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah.

22:49 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  And if you don't know how to respond to it, that's what Ryan's there for, because Ryan's excellent at redirecting, asking objections, asking for clarity and or maybe it's something you need to.  escalate to him and he'll be like, hey, Jason, let's talk about this a little bit more so I can understand your concerns around compliance.  And then talk it through, right?

23:10 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah, yeah.

23:16 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  That was just a bit of feedback. I wanted to give you that I think all of us, you know, there's if it was just like, here's the listing, what do you think?  And they're like, no, that's one thing. But like, if they only get two a month and half of the team, well, we know 90% of the team's energy goes into these write-ups, then just being like, I don't like compliance, but everything else was good.  It's like, why, you know?

23:39 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah. That's a good point. Cool.

23:47 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  I know Jason finds a lot of reasons to be unhappy with things too. So we have to like hold him accountable to that and call him out on that because he, no matter what you do, that man will find a reason to be unhappy.

25:00 - Luke Gillespie
  mail and then there's then I'm picking up the phone like oh I wasn't sure if this was you and and um and then the upspot is doing this weird thing where when they call it says you are consent to being recorded so I get a lot of sarcastic comments they're like I guess I can think I'm considering to be recorded and I'm like I'm sorry the CRM just doesn't automatically I turned off the recording button right um but anyways yeah I've just been getting some sarcastic and weird responses from the brokers about the voicemail not really adding up and they didn't really know it was me so that's why I brought it up to the team a couple ideas were brought up but some some brought up maybe we have Eda do it and say she's like our assistant or something I said I'm I'm kind of concerned having anyone with an accent on the voicemail um I said maybe we want it to just be my voice because I'm the one who uses the phone the most with all the brokers but then it's gonna be maybe weird when Ryan does an off-market call so then I said maybe we we should have it be just be Athena's voice as the voice of the company said hey if you're trying to reach my team Luca Ryan they'll be they'll be back with you in a minute something like that so those were kind of my-  brainstorms, my suggestions, I was going to ask you what your thoughts were, what you think would be best.

26:05 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, I mean, that's a problem. If it's like, that's been three months that it's using the wrong name. So like, that should have been flagged a while ago, right?  the team meetings are a great place to do that. And again, managing upwards, hey, Athena, here's a script I wrote, can you record this?  Like, I can do it five seconds, if you give me a script and just tell me it's a problem.  So I'm totally fine to change it. Ryan or David, do you guys have any opinions on who is doing it or what the message needs to be?

26:41 - AcquiMatch Team
  Nope, I think it can be you or more.

26:45 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, I'm happy to do it and say, Hey, I'm the founder or whatever, you know, like just write a script on what you think it should be.  Unfortunately, we can't turn off the recording thing if we are going to use the recording function in HubSpot. So that's just  An automatic thing that happens.

27:02 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah, all right. Yeah, I'll create a script and send it to you if you can have you do it.

27:07 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Great.

27:09 - Luke Gillespie
  All right. Um, yeah, I'm kind of thinking something like, uh, thanks for calling Aquamatch. If you're looking to speak to him over the team, Luke or Ryan, they'll get to you soon things like that.  don't know. Yeah, but I'll think about it. bounce some ideas off Ryan as well.

27:24 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  All right. All right.

27:27 - Luke Gillespie
  I did also want to ask, uh, I've been thinking about this, um, because Athena, uh, sorry, but Anka had told me that there was, there's a reason that we called our investor profiles, investor profiles and set up buyer profiles that they used to be buyer profiles.  I brought it up. I said, can we call them buyer profiles? I think it's more befitting to the space that we're in.  We're not working with investors. We're working with buyers and every single broker has referred to our clients as buyers.  Never an investor. Is there a reason why their investor profiles?

27:53 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Or do you have any thoughts? There was a reason. It's a good spot. so when. I first started the business and I was reaching out to brokers.  What we were doing was so new and honestly, I was lacking the confidence and conviction and in terms of like being a bi-side advisor search thingy that I said, I was an investor, which was true at the time.  I was like, I have investors, which was true because our first couple clients were investors and the deals. So that's why we did that.  So I am totally happy and on board for buyers because we've been out of the closet for a long time now about being bi-side support.  But when we first started, we didn't even advertise the Aquimatch service on any of our channels or any of our websites.  So it was unrestricted ventures and, you know, was like me as the forefront because honestly, when I did start the business, I was still intending on continuing my own search.  I was like, well, how do I get paid to do what I want to do? So I was like, I'll do other people's searches, which will pay for me to get my own search and then I'll have a whole thing that works like even better for me so I can buy businesses and then I was like, I think I need to focus on business now.  So, yeah, there was a reason why it was investor profile because when I was doing the broker calls, the way that I was getting through to them was saying like, Hey, I'm a buyer.  I would use the property management example and the raising three million and I was like, I have a couple of investors and I also look at businesses for them.  And I'm the kind of like, you know, I bet it and then I'll pass it over to them kind of thing and that's how we were able to get in.  And then, and then when Ryan joined we had to test the theory of like, could we step out of that and actually be representing, you know, people in their search buyers in their search and we just never changed the name to buyer at that point.  But when Brian took over and started doing all the. worker falls, we dropped the investor language or positioning altogether.

30:05 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah, no, I understand that makes sense. But yeah, so feel free to change it to buyer profile.

30:11 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  I think it's a good spot, good improvement. We want to make sure we're not confusing the brokers any more than we already do.  Exactly.

30:23 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah. And another thing is because sometimes the brokers see investors and they're like all this, they want to be a passive investor by not an owner operator.  So that's another, another benefit to it. Yeah. Oh, and then we have this change considerably since we started with all of these people that are trying to do searches now.

30:43 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  And so, yeah, they're wary of that, but they're also aware of, you know, search services and brokers are a little bit more up to speed.  Yeah. It's interesting, though, like I just watched this. Webinar that the IBBA did on. legislation of like broker legislation regionally and that sort of thing and like all the dudes on it that were part of this like consortium lobbying the government they're well into their mid 60s or higher, you know, so there's very much still this like generational gap between the brokers and the buyers.

31:27 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah, you're telling me, I mean, I'm 23 with all these old white guys just every day.

31:34 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  I love you though. They're reaching out to me on LinkedIn telling me how impressed they are with you. So, you know, like they, the thing about that age group is they don't have anything to prove anymore.  You know, they do enjoy it and also a lot of like  when my boyfriend was considering business broking and he stood up at the meeting like they all came over.  a legacy over to someone, there's no new blood coming into brokering. So if you think about it from that lens, Luke, like you might might be your edge with them, like placating to the fact that you know that they have decades of experience.  And you know, like you appreciate that and realize the path that they paved for all of us to do what we do.  They  love that because it's like they have no one to pass it down to and that sucks. And they're at the age where they're hanging on to it because they love it, but they know that they're not going to be able to do it forever.

32:32 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah, yeah, that's a good point. They're they're nearly nice guys.

32:37 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah. Yeah, most of them are and that's the thing is like when you get to that age, you don't have a point to prove anymore because you've had a good career, you're good at what you do when you do it because you enjoy it.  So you get someone that's like, huh, it's not necessarily like you don't want to position yourself as you don't know what you're doing.  But it's like, hey, I love this business. I, you know, appreciate so much all the things that you all have done to pave the way for, you know, us to be able to do what we do.  Then you're kind of saying, like, I'm sure I could learn a lot from you on, you know, the cell side and, like, love these conversations and all the insights and experience that you have, like, and that might be an icebreaker for you, like, what was the craziest deal you ever worked on?  And then you're getting them telling more stories and they  love you forever. Like, this is how I get every old, they're not even old.  I'm, , they're 20 years older than me. It's not like old and older men love me because I'm like, tell me your story, you know, like, oh, my God, that's so crazy.  And that's how I'd get all of the owners to, like, love me too. Yeah, when you just get them telling their stories and feeling like somebody cares, somebody's listening, somebody, like that their whole career is validated because they get to tell that story, you know, share their advice.

34:00 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah. Yeah.

34:03 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So if they see you as a, that's, that's what most of them see me as, is they see me as, you know, a daughter, like, that's why I end up getting getting, it's, it's not a young lady kind of thing, although there's probably some element of that.  But what I get the vibe I get from most of them is they see me as like a daughter, you know, and they'll tell me about their daughters that I remind them of and you know that sort of thing.  So like if you can get yourself positioned as like the mentee and that sort of thing, they love it.

34:34 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah, exactly. You're right. Cool. Good. I don't have anything else to ask, but yeah, thanks for being open minded for the voicemail on the buyer profile looking forward to improving things.

34:48 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yes, always. I'm so far removed from it now. Like you guys have to bring this stuff up because I don't you all.

34:55 - Luke Gillespie
  can go on vacation for a week and come back and clients have two deals that they're working on at once.  Awesome, yeah, cool, David or Ryan anything anything else that can help you guys with?

35:11 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Ryan, you're muted.

35:13 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah.

35:16 - AcquiMatch Team
  Did you want to talk about the performance base note in the model?

35:25 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, so tell me what you're thinking for Thursday, really quick. I'll give you some homework so that we can work here tomorrow if we go find some time.
  SCREEN SHARING: Acquimatch started screen sharing - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/265286565?timestamp=2168.166287

35:35 - AcquiMatch Team
  So I believe the home is there's one of these models open right now. Okay, you So, I can't remember where it was, what was this right here?  Where's the part with what's what's happened to seller note on deal structure?

36:30 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, keep scrolling down. Seller debt.

36:37 - AcquiMatch Team
  Seller debt percentage.

36:40 - David R
  Go back up.

36:42 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  See the different. There's three different seller note options there.

36:48 - AcquiMatch Team
  Got it. Yes, this is the one. Performance revenue target. What's that?

36:56 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  That's the, like, say your, okay, so. First of all, before we get into performance notes, under what conditions can somebody put a performance note into an SBA level?

37:06 - AcquiMatch Team
  Fast performance.

37:08 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Right, so they can only add a performance based note if there's higher pass performance to peg it to. So I didn't want to say that on the call of adjustments so that you can bring this up on Thursday because he's saying he wants to do a performance note.  Do you know if he knows that it has to be like a higher peg in the past?

37:28 - AcquiMatch Team
  Yes, I believe he does. I think I told him like, hey, so here's the thing. So this, this business, it's unsure how much is coming from firm, because he doesn't have any tracking on that.  We ask the question on the seller call, right? So when you buy this business, you're not sure how much of the business is coming from these referrals from a personal network.  So the idea is to identify that and then create a performance based note on the revenue, on total revenue.  So let's say last year, we'll say this. Say two million dollars and say, hey, we want to create a note that's tied to this revenue so that we continue to get this minimum revenue.  We don't becomes out of the note.

38:12 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay, so my understanding is it can't be tied to the past year. It has to be getting a business back to a performance level that it performed in the plant past.

38:26 - AcquiMatch Team
  Interesting. So it cannot be the most recent.

38:30 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  No, because like I am almost positive, you can verify, maybe make a list for Wendy because this is one of those things that would be worth talking about.  my understanding is Say 22 was high, 23 was low, was a little bit better. So if you want to get it back to 22 levels, then you can build it in a performance base note because it's getting back to a previous performance.  Now. Getting. to perform exactly the same as the previous year, that's something I've never asked her before, that's interesting.  You know, like, can you build in a portion of the note that says they have to at least hit what they did in the previous year just to make sure.  So ask Wendy that, my understanding is it can't be on the most recent year's performance, though it needs to be tied to previous better performance.  Now, in this case, if you were, if we were, if she's like, yeah, if you just want to, like, say that a portion of the note is based on them performing exactly the same as last year, and not incentivize.  So what can't happen is it can't look like an earn-out, which is incentivizing them to increase the business, right?  So you're buying based on the seller increasing the business in the future, which is future gazing not working in the past.

39:55 - AcquiMatch Team
  So we talked about that, we made it clear that that's not the idea. The idea is, so the thing is,  Is that, let's say, I believe she did the same revenue for the last two years. So it would be, regardless, it'd be $2 million revenue, 2024 and 2023.

40:10 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  But what I don't know is it, like, my understanding is it has to be higher previous year and it had to have dropped and the incentivization is getting to previous levels.  So that's what you want to check with Wendy on the performance performing the same as they have the last two years and not dropping below that.  See what she says about that, because I'm interested. That's a really good point. I always just worked under the assumption that it has to be getting it back to a previous point.

40:44 - AcquiMatch Team
  Got it. Okay, Oscar.

40:47 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  And if it is allowed, then you would put the performance revenue target at 0% I imagine. And then the performance note is like whatever percentage of the purchase price  that you want to make performance based.

41:06 - AcquiMatch Team
  So we would want to pretty much make whatever percent so if we get let's say if we got a clear understanding from her that 20% of the business coming in is referrals we'd want to make a 20% out essentially saying like okay there's a 20% note that's based off 20% of businesses is referrals then it's like so if you drop what is it then how do we model that out I guess is the question like if it's let's say it shows it finishes 10% below the target revenue $2 million or let's just do a million to make it easy so the first year they do $900,000 how does that affect the note exactly right um so let's say let's say Wendy says yeah you can you can do a performance note based on achieving the same

42:00 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  results as last year, which would be  cool. I really want you to find out the answer to that because it's a tool I haven't thought of before.  Okay, so let's for the purposes of this say that 20%, you want to do 20% performance note, then you do 20% as the performance note percentage.  And then, if either there's different ways of structuring it, either they have to hit 100% of it, and then it get paid, or that's typically my first point that I would go out.  It's like it's either hit and you get it or not. Sometimes they'll be like, what if we get 50% so then you can have a waterfall or have it be based on the percentage of the performance based note that they achieved.  let's say it's million, you're doing 20% base, 20%. Note, you've agreed that you'll pay a percentage of the note based on the percentage of performance between the delta, so 50 percent.  So then you would pay 50 percent of the note after that performance metric was met because they only got 50 percent of the performance.  Note, that would be part two of the negotiations. So I'd say, we're going to pay you this much. You get this no matter what, 5 percent of that is an equity injection, right?  don't, don't do the 20, 35, 50 percent is the equity injection. Do understand the difference between equity injection and seller note?

43:41 - AcquiMatch Team
  Yeah, cool.

43:44 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So like on this one standby period should be two years, seller note, 5 percent, and then if you want to build in any additional note, then it should go on seller note too.  If it's performance based, then that percentage should go on. performance based. I would always build in at least 5% for 5 to 10% for equity ejection.  That's on full standby for two years. You're not going to want to build in the whole note there because they're not going to want to wait on full standby for like if there's just like let's say for this example 10% equity injection and then 10% seller note and then the repayment would start usually after year one and on the second part of that.

44:27 - AcquiMatch Team
  Okay.

44:28 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  But in order for it to count towards equity injection it needs to be on full standby for two years.

44:35 - AcquiMatch Team
  Sure I got that.

44:37 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah cool. Then for the performance based note that usually I'd want to see a performance at least for like an and the SBA to allow it has to be a full calendar year be configurable based on the tax returns.

44:54 - AcquiMatch Team
  All right so how do you model that out using this calculator? So let's say they only hit 50. 50% of the target, so you're going to discount them 50% on the payment.  How do you use this calculator to do that?

45:08 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Um, you didn't build on the sophistication. This is like you hit it or you don't.

45:20 - AcquiMatch Team
  So 20% note completely tied to hitting the million dollar revenue target. If you don't hit it, you don't get paid out on.  Cause the note should be getting paid monthly. Is that right?

45:37 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  No, I like doing annual payments to sellers, but they, so all of this is negotiation tools, always start with what's going to be the best for our buyer.  Annual payments are going to be better. Seller might want monthly, right? For the performance based note, they need to have a full calendar year for SBA to be okay with.  So, like, if they buy the business this year, they will not be able to get payments until 2027 on the performance-based note.

46:15 - AcquiMatch Team
  Okay, I'm just trying to think of how this goes. performance revenue target. So, how does this work right here?  How does this line work?

46:31 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Well, normally you're setting a revenue target that they need to hit to unlock that performance-based note.

46:36 - AcquiMatch Team
  Yeah.

46:38 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So, say, like, getting it 10, whatever percent increase is the target to unlock that note.

46:46 - AcquiMatch Team
  Oh, okay. Because it's based on fast performance.

46:53 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  It'll be an increase. Okay. So, let's say that- in 2022 they did a million dollars in revenue in 2023 they did 750 and then in 2024 they did 800 so you'd need I'm gonna  up my percentages here but let's say for the purposes of this discussion a 20% revenue increase would get him back to the million.  I know my numbers are wrong but just are you tracking there.

47:27 - AcquiMatch Team
  Right. So that would be 20% here.

47:30 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah.

47:31 - AcquiMatch Team
  20% revenue performance revenue target would be a 20% increase on the most previous year. Right. Okay.

47:38 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Then the percentage of the purchase price is the performance note percentage.

47:42 - AcquiMatch Team
  All right. 20% now.

47:46 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah. If you're saying like you're basing at 20% of the sales. Yeah. 20% of the total purchase price will be a performance based note.  And that will be based on the business hitting at 20%. increase in year one.

48:03 - AcquiMatch Team
  Okay. Yes, I mean, this is my so I just need to play with it and actually see this how this actually maps out like people are getting to this part of here and like, how do I do this right here?  so I'm like, I have to ask me to know that.

48:26 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, work it because if we need to have Mitchell make some you know, changes in there like, you know, there's a peg or a waterfall or whatever, like we could do that.  But I need you guys to like work the model and tell me what's like, like, we don't have this feature in here, we want to add this thing in.  So at the moment, it's just said, it's like, you hit the note and you get paid or you don't got it.  But we can we can add more features in. So what I what I need for me is like, see where they're getting blocked or see what we can't add in here and give me that feedback so I can get him to update tomorrow.

49:00 - AcquiMatch Team
  Oh, yeah, that's fine, but for the sake of just me doing this on buyers club on Thursday, I want to get an idea of this kind of stuff and start because people are getting to this part here.  So they're doing, how do I do this stuff? How do what I do here? So that's, I feel like enough questions have been around this that I can kind of, you know, instead of just being general financials this, this, this, like we could get some more specifics to talk about things.

49:30 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  think they'll appreciate that. Yeah, but like you want to show it. So like what I'd say is like get some examples together where you filled this out, go through it with me tomorrow and then go through it with them on Thursday.

49:50 - AcquiMatch Team
  That's right. Yeah, so I'm going to ask for Justin's because he's doing this right now and we literally had like an hour where we talked about these scenarios.  So I'm already familiar with that and he'll be on the call so we can talk. for it. And so just if they just see me and him talking through it playing with it, talking about how we came best case force case, it'll get everyone an idea how to do that.

50:08 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah. don't get don't get them too confused with like different methodologies behind the performance note. Like let's get the heads wrapped around the overall concept of it.  A percentage increase in revenue needs to be hit in order for that note to be released.

50:27 - AcquiMatch Team
  Okay.

50:28 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  And then you can get more into the like advanced parts of it. Well, it's like, well, if you know, you can use that as a negotiating tool that you can waterfall it and have it be based on a percentage, we're going to update that in the next, you know, model.  But for now, just focus on like hitting the note, you know, because that's what you're basing your assumptions off of is that they're they're hitting a certain target.  And this is only allowable under certain circumstances. I try to get on the phone with Wendy before Thursday and just verify that.

51:00 - AcquiMatch Team
  Whether I'm correct or not and it has to be a higher performance in the past year It can't be based on just attaching it to the most recent years performance If we can that's pretty  cool Okay, cool, okay I got a couple other quick things for you Luke and David, I don't want to close you guys any longer you guys can probably just jump All Nice work guys.

51:32 - Luke Gillespie
  All right. Thanks.

51:34 - AcquiMatch Team
  Okay. Thank you guys.

51:35 - Luke Gillespie
  All right.

51:35 - David R
  Take care.

51:36 - Luke Gillespie
  Bye Let me get the note takers out.

51:47 - AcquiMatch Team
  Okay Okay Okay, yours is still in here.

51:55 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  was just getting Luke's out.

51:56 - AcquiMatch Team
  didn't know what you wanted to talk to me about. Yeah, that's what I was trying to do too. Okay, cool  want to just tell you a couple things here. So I had a call with Jason. So his direct feedback was that he doesn't feel like he's getting the value of $5,000 a month out of the service.  I was like, okay, can you elaborate? He's like, yeah, he's like, I've never paid $5,000 for service before, and it's my first time doing this.  And he's like, I kind of feel like I should be spoken to or like, there should be communication between us every day.  So you're saying communication just in terms of touch points, he doesn't feel, he said that sometimes there's days that go by and just nothing.  don't hear anything. And he's like, if I do the math, I'm paying like $200 a day. So that was his one thing.  The second thing was he just says, he just feels like the pretty much like the write-ups just aren't like sinking in.  They're just not direct hits. He's like, you know, Tariq has been good in this, but that's really just like the only deal I've been able to have been like, look at it and be like, this is what I want.  And he's like, if the other ones were like that too, that's great. But really, in the time that I've been here, it's really only been that one, which I've submitted my UI.  I'm trying to work on it, it has problems, but you know, if there are more businesses like that, that'd be better.  But the other ones, there's problems with it, or I don't like this or that. I was excited, he was like, you know, I was excited about the SaaS business, but now as I've gotten into it, it seems like there's a lot more, there's a lot of problems going on with it.  And I kind of feel like a lot of the deals are like that, essentially. So, listen, I appreciate the honest feedback, and you know, we've only been doing this for a year and a half, so all your feedback is welcomed and, you know, we want to make the service better for everybody.  We do with including yourself because you still have a whole month left with us. we want to make sure you're providing the best service.  Do you want to, would you like to set up a bi-weekly two calls a week with me so you can be out of formal communication?  He was like, no, we can keep it at one call. So I said, okay, I said, you know, are you still interested in buying a business?  He said, yes. I said, okay, well, how are you feeling about to reach deal? Like, we have, we're, we we're, we, we have one around the Y.  He said, uh, he said, well, there's just a lot of problems. Like, he said that Matthias, he got with Matthias.  Matthias doesn't, sounds like he doesn't want to work on the deal. It doesn't sound like Jason likes Matthias. He's like, I told them what I wanted.  I was like, I got this business, the accounting's bad, and they're like, Matthias essentially told them, like, you, you can't let that back.  So he's like, I don't really want to work with Matthias. He doesn't, he doesn't seem like a go-getter. He doesn't seem like a yes, man.  He's like, Tony on the hand is really going after it. But he needs bank statements and needs more stuff.
  ACTION ITEM: Call Tooti re Jason's Tariq deal. Discuss next steps, requirements. Report back to Jason. - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/265286565?timestamp=3316.9999  And it seems like there's still a lot that needs to be done before I get here. So I asked him to elaborate a little bit.  And he's like, I'm not sure. Tony knows what he needs to get. I said, would you like me to reach out to Tony for you and have a conversation with him about what needs to get done and I can, you know, give my feedback to him?  He said, that'd be great. Sorry, I'll give Tony a call. I'm just trying to like give himself in here.  I was playing on calling to me anyway, so I figured it'd be a good thing to do. And then I said, look, you know, I'm sorry here, you know, you're going to be ending service was with us.  know, we still have a month left that I'd like to give you the best service possible and Hopefully in that time you reconsider working with us and he said I haven't I haven't completely put that on my mind He said I go on my long bike ride, then I rethink these things all the time.
  ACTION ITEM: Schedule follow-up call w/ Jason. Re-engage on Tariq deal. Discuss daily communication/expectations. - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/265286565?timestamp=3360.9999  My most recent one is I'm thinking I'm not getting the value of the service So okay So my plan is I'm gonna call Tootie set up another call with him I try to get him to bite even by me.  Just do whatever I can to get this closer this to reek deal closer like I got to get in here now, right?  So I'll get in here speak with Tootie Right in storm what he's thinking on this if he thinks that's possible tell him what I think and then see if we can get this Our best shot I think is keeping him he's like really Getting this movie because I think Jason's still doing the Jason thing which is he just he sits back and he hopes to anything  it's care of it or we take care of it. He's not, he's not trying to do it himself. So my plan is to do that, set up a second call with him, get him re-engaged in this, speak with the team, try to get another, you know, tell them all hands on deck, we really need to get something for Jason Zilaka's team.  And then in these calls, get them, get them locked in, you know, we got a whole another month. And then, you know, maybe in two or three calls, maybe a week out.  I'll just try to sell. Hey, look, we're making progress here. Are you still set on stopping or, you know, what are you, what are your thoughts?

57:43 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  First of all, great job having a difficult conversation. I know those aren't friendly or fun, especially with somebody like Jason.  So I think you handled it really well, and I appreciate your willing to have those conversations. If we're to put customer service aside for one  a second. What is your feeling about Jason as a customer and a potential business owner?

58:12 - AcquiMatch Team
  I feel he just in general, he needs more hand-held it. He expects us to do a lot for him.  I think what you've done of like constantly like set the expectations, set the expectations is important with someone like him, right?  he will be like, I thought, remember at the beginning he was like, I thought I going to get a write up a day or something.  Remember, said that immediately. And so he said that he's like, you know, I feel like there's some communication every day.  I said, we do talk about you every day. We have meetings about you. talk about your deals. We look through things.  We get through sims. We're talking to brokers. We filter out business. starting to fit for you. So, you know, are you talking?  want to hear that information? He's like, well, yeah, maybe, and then he kind of talked a little bit. So anyways, I think he could buy a business.  Like, I think this Tariq thing could work, right? He's just a little bit more challenging. think. Yeah.

59:19 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Hmm. He's not doing the things to get this deal done, though. So, like, that to me is like, what are you going to be like as a business owner?  And then you're going to be like, I bought a bad business. It's like, no business is going to come without  words or problems.  know, it just. I don't think there's any making Jason happy and. He is pointing out some areas where we could improve.  But equally, when I first talked to him, was like, how do you feel about taking six to 12 months to buy.  business. It's not like they go through the sales process and it's like, this is a quick thing. We could improve deal flow, but he's under offer on something right now and he wants it to be like an easy  check the box thing.  And it's like, you've got an off market deal. This is what it takes. So I think there's also an element of like, you need to step up and do the work.  You're never going to get this done if you don't. And we can't  drag you to the water tank. So like, I don't know, I got that message.  was talking to Cole about it last night. he's like, I know you're going to do the thing I think and try to do like everything to help him, but at the same time, like he's been a  problem since day one and his expectations have been like, misaligned and he's not doing the work.  So I don't know. I'm conflicted about whether we let him. I think we still need to do everything we can, but also is he doing everything he can.

1:01:00 - AcquiMatch Team
  Yeah. Okay. Yeah. And then so he was like, you know, $5,000 a month. said, uh, are you, are you still planning on buying a business?  And he said, yes. And I said, well, the $5,000 a month can be treated as equity rejection. So as long as you continue working with us, as long as you buy a business the next 12 months, like you discussed with Athena, because he did say that he's, I told Athena 12 months, he's like, I'm halfway there.  And I just don't feel like I'm close to buying a business.

1:01:28 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  And I said, you're not close. You're under  offer. What the ? Did you call about that? what do you mean you're not close?

1:01:37 - AcquiMatch Team
  You're on an off market manufacturing company. Yeah. Yeah. I think I let him talk for a while. And then I came back to like, well, we are, we are under a little while at Tariq.  Like, are you not feeling good about that anymore? And that's, that's when we started talking about Tutti. I said, I'll jump in there.  I'll talk to him. I'll set up another call and he'll talk. okay. Appreciate it. Thanks, Jason. Wait, look, we ended it there.

1:02:06 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  And he knows he still pays the success fee whether he works with us or not, right?

1:02:13 - AcquiMatch Team
  I didn't get to that because I didn't want to like be like, I feel like I can maybe win him back over.  We have only left. And then if it comes down as I'm leaving, I think, OK, just a reminder, like, if you do close on three, you know, we still do take that success fee.

1:02:31 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah. Even if we find him new businesses, he's still going to have to do a shitload of work. You know, I think So if he wants daily communication, then  and daily reminding him what he should be doing, it's like, okay, have you done this? Have you done this?  What's the status on getting the updated books from Tariq? Have you explored having a local bookkeeper go in there and do the thing?  Like you're now being told by multiple people, including the leading broker that you're not going to be able to get this done without financials?  Like have you listed this episode where this person had to do this? Like reminding him on a daily basis that this takes work from him.  Like we're doing a fuckload on our side and if he's not matching that, he's never going to this done because we cannot buy the business for him.  We cannot go through this process for him. We're a search and match company with advisory. So like, you know, I I was just watching the regulations and stuff too, like on the brokerage and, you know, there's  As long as it's an asset sale, it's not securities and that sort of thing. But I just see Jason like , you know, he's in when I met him, he was in a lawsuit on somebody else who hadn't delivered on what they said they were going to deliver and like he was the only client that tried to change the contract on me and it's really hard to get signed up and I should have, you know, again, it was like, I need the revenue and I took it from clients that were like, I wouldn't, if I had the choice, I probably wouldn't, like I'm, no, our contract is our contract, I'm not  changing it for you, you know.  So because it's an indication of what's to come and like, if you think somebody's just going to like hand a business to you and you don't need to do anything, like Wendy told me after her first conversation with him, she's like, I love all your clients, but she  He's then concerns me.

1:05:02 - AcquiMatch Team
  Yeah. Yeah. That all that being said, we did get him under L.O.I. And if that guy had his financials together, we may be like closing the business right now.  Right.

1:05:16 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  But like the other thing I think about Ryan is like, what are you going to be like as a business owner?

1:05:22 - AcquiMatch Team
  Yeah.

1:05:24 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
   me, you know, he wants everybody to like make his life easy for him. And he just complains about everything and doesn't take any ownership of like what he can be doing or how he can be making this happen.  Every time I get on a call with him and give him feedback, he tells me he's already doing it.  Like he's not kind of like, I just, so part of me is like, I don't know if he should be a business owner, you know, like, then what he gets a slow note because tuning is like we'll close on anything and then he bankrupts himself.  And then what he comes after us and claims us. So, I don't know. That's where my head goes. just sharing and venting with you because it's frustrating.  You know, he's under-offered. He doesn't feel like he's close to buying a business because it's not easy. It's .

1:06:15 - AcquiMatch Team
  Okay, so I'll call 2D on that one and see what I can do on that one. And then I'll do another call with Jason.  And then we'll, I'll give you a few, I'll let you know how that goes.

1:06:33 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  I mean, like, do you think you can daily chase him?

1:06:38 - AcquiMatch Team
  I'm Tariq.

1:06:40 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, just like what's happening with that. Like, it's like you want to hear from us daily. Like, so I would be like, hey, you know, like, honestly, when you're under-offered the works on you and we're here as an advisor to you, but if you want, I'll turn up the heat and I'll check in on you every day and tell you what you should be doing.  Because you're going to lose momentum. There's a lot of work that you need to do. It does not matter.  what compliance? Was that a valid reason? Did you? Are you familiar? I didn't look at the right up or anything, but...

1:08:07 - AcquiMatch Team
  Yeah, I think I looked it up. pulled it up. I pulled up the industry. I went and looked at the compliance.  I looked and see. I can't remember what my conclusion what all that was, but I was like, like, it's just kind of a Jason response.
  ACTION ITEM: Brainstorm response to Andrew re missed off-market deals. Prepare make-right plan. Discuss w/ Athena tmrw 11am. - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/265286565?timestamp=4100.9999
  ACTION ITEM: Immediately start work on off-market deals Andrew mentioned 5 weeks ago. Prepare update for tmrw's call. - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/265286565?timestamp=4113.9999  Okay. Something else I want to go over with you with. So, Andrew, today, I was to the message saying on a threat, an old threat back from February, the end of February.  So, about a month ago, he posted a list of, like, off-market deals, potential websites to look at. I emailed...  or I got with Eda. said, Eda, can you please add these to the off-market search? She goes, okay. Then today, Andrew posts a response and he says, can I get some update on any of these?  What was sent out to them and what, and did we get any kind of response? So I mess with Eda.  said, hey, please provide the responses for these deals to Andrew. And she says that she never, she never got around to doing it.  I said, well, I asked you to add these to the emails so that these could be included in the Muslim email.  And she said, That right up's got behind last month for on market. We shifted to on market and put those on hold.  We currently only gathered the information needed to contact them. Loop needed help with on market goals. So I only focused on helping him to get minimums.  I'm sorry if I fell behind.

1:10:41 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  How long ago was this that Andrew asked us about it?

1:10:46 - AcquiMatch Team
  Just today.

1:10:47 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  No, but how long ago did he put those on our radar?

1:10:51 - AcquiMatch Team
  About five weeks ago.

1:10:54 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  OK, what do you think the response should be?

1:10:57 - AcquiMatch Team
  Yeah, I know I saw it right before this call. So I started thinking about it. I was going to doubt.  It's because you know what she thinks about this. I'm trying to think about what I should say to him.  You You It may be say something like. Not sure.

1:12:43 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Have a think about it. I should have been on the road by now. So, um, get to find us some time.  Actually, let's pull up our calendar now so we can chat about that. Have a think about how we can respond and make it right.  What we need to do and then also what we need to do differently. In the future, I don't know Edo was the right person to brief with that.

1:13:08 - AcquiMatch Team
  Yeah. I mean, I should have at least followed up with her. Where are we on these, you know?

1:13:18 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Um, get David on it ASAP. Um, and then we'll think of a first, but like just it's been a long day.  So why don't you sleep on it and think about how we can respond and make it right and what the men's of anything we need to do with Andrew.

1:13:34 - AcquiMatch Team
  My issue is, is that before I knew any of this, I said, no problem. We'll get your responses by end of day.  And then I sent the message to Eda and she informed me on this.

1:13:48 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah.

1:13:50 - AcquiMatch Team
  So I told them already the message I'd get a response. I have a call with them tomorrow afternoon that we have that buyer's our call tomorrow.

1:13:56 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah. Um, so I'd. Just buy some time and just say like, Hey, Andrew, I'm going to update you on tomorrow's call.

1:14:09 - AcquiMatch Team
  Just just like circling back with the team. And I'll update you on tomorrow's call. Yeah.

1:14:18 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  That's what I was thinking.

1:14:20 - AcquiMatch Team
  was thinking about that. Hey, like, let's, let's discuss on tomorrow's call. Can you join 15 minutes early. And then I'd be like, I could just be like.  Hey, were planning on doing. Adding this to our email reach hasn't been going. That we haven't been getting many responses for your area.  We did collect the information. So we do have the phone numbers for businesses and stuff. We haven't, we haven't yet done the, the calls on that, but I've made it a priority now to have.

1:14:59 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Let me try. I'm sorry my brain's so fried like I need to sleep on it. So can we can we just have a think about it by yourself?  Sometimes say you'll discuss it tomorrow. I feel like we need to be men's So just think through some some ways that we can make it right too.  Okay, I think we need to own it and And also figure out a way to make it right. have a think about that and then let's chat about it tomorrow my day is pretty  Crazy.

1:15:33 - AcquiMatch Team
  Yep What time is your call with him It is No, you're time , I don't have any time before that Okay, I'll figure it out Like it's not it's not

1:16:11 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)

1:16:26 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)

1:17:36 - AcquiMatch Team
  Yeah.

1:17:40 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  It's all good. Like, you know, we very rarely rarely make mistakes. And they just give us an opportunity to tighten up our  and show people who we are and that we care and we're going to make it.  So let's think about how we do that.

1:17:58 - AcquiMatch Team
  That's right. Got it. Oh, awesome.

1:18:01 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Thanks, Ryan. I'll see you tomorrow at 11. I'll have talk about, I think that's important. And then if I need to step out, but have them modeling done by then too, if you can, so we can have a few minutes to talk about it.
