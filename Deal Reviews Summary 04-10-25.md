0:11 - Luke Gillespie
  Hi, the anchor here.

0:14 - Anke Badenhorst
  I'm here. Okay, I'm getting a class from Chris to be an editor.

0:20 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Did we share a make a copy link or did we share the action.

0:24 - Anke Badenhorst
  No, I shared a make a copy link, but it looks like his browser didn't refresh and didn't get the updated link when I when I updated on their deal resources dashboard.  So I already sort of that up with him. You said it's working now.

0:41 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay. Thank you. Cool. All right, we have an agenda today. So great suggestion, Luke. I like that you're holding me accountable to the stuff you learned in bootcamp.  Clearly important to me. So let me. can you pull that? I don't know if there's a way, like, there's got to be a way for AI to, like, compile all this stuff.

1:12 - Anke Badenhorst
  Like, after meeting, after meeting, action items?

1:19 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  No, like, if we're all sharing in a thread what the actions items are, like, no, no, I'm having to go into- I know sorry, Luke.  What I'm saying is that if everybody's adding into a thread, what they want the agenda items to be, surely there's a tool that can compile it all into one agenda when this meeting starts.

1:44 - Luke Gillespie
  Okay, then you say the other day that you already have one in mind that can help us.

1:48 - Anke Badenhorst
  Yeah, I just have to freaking remember the name of it. Okay, I mean, it's kind of weird that I'm like Claude or Albert or something or Kyle or something.  It had that weird type of name, the last one that I used it. Okay.

2:06 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Sorry, go ahead, Anka.

2:08 - Anke Badenhorst
  I've already thought of a way for us to keep all of our meeting agendas organized. know, we can also use it for action items that comes out of these meetings for both the meeting meetings, the deal review meetings and in the team meetings.

2:26 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  And it's going to be in Slack.

2:29 - Anke Badenhorst
  It's going to be in, it's going to be, it's going to be in notion. And then it's going to send messages to Slack and then you click on the button, you can add your agenda at your item.  So it's everybody will go to the same place. not going to be a random chat.

2:45 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Well. We're going to have to see how that feels from a workflow, because that was really easy for all of us to feed in on a channel on Slack.  So what I don't want to do is just make more work for people. like having to like remember to go to notion and fill it out there and get it all in one place.  Like how do we use and this is my whole call out. I don't know if you've had a chance to read the thread, but like how do we make our lives easier by incorporating AI because it is really easy to drop everything into a Slack channel.  And then I imagine there's an AI tool that just like pulls it all into an agenda rather than like, okay, I gotta go in the notion now and pull out the thing.  We've tried this before. We've tried using meeting agendas and notion and it's not working. Because we're not using like we've tried it, you know, and for deal team meetings and everything.  So Onka's amazing like keeping everything organized, but also she is probably the only one that uses them half the time.  So I want to be realistic with like what what does the team going to use? Like how do we make it easier on the team?  Like it's a good suggestion and it needs to happen because it's I'm I'm not getting clarity on where what mine said I need to be in and all of the meetings too.  Sure, Ryan feels the same way and like, you know, if you guys aren't having an agenda on the deal team meetings that needs that too.  I'm surprised that the change that we talked about a long time ago where you're getting off halfway through isn't it sounds like it's still not happening by Luke's agenda points.

4:20 - Anke Badenhorst
  Uh, no, it's not happening.

4:23 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay, so that's a problem because we already talked about it and we need those two and a half hours of your time back.  I requested that weeks ago. So, anyways, it's not, it's not on the agenda to talk about this, but that's what I want.
  ACTION ITEM: Compile monthly write-up numbers since Nov, deliver by 11am CT tomorrow - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/272936516?timestamp=274.9999  Cool. Okay, so write up numbers.

4:44 - Luke Gillespie
  You pull that up.

4:45 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So, what I need from you all is to help on to get the numbers from however many months since we stopped tracking this accurately.  So I need a monthly number on writeups, please. And I need that as soon as possible. mean, ideally today would be great because Luke already knows, all right, you guys have heard this.  I wanna do some calculations to see how much these writeups are costing us. So, Oka can't do the tracking on her own.  Like, Luke, you're probably the closest one to know what the actual writeup numbers are. So if we've been skipping steps in HubSpot and that sort of thing, she's not gonna be able to pull those numbers.  So I want the writeup numbers. So what can y'all do to get those and get them quickly without spending a whole ton of time on them?

5:41 - Luke Gillespie
  Okay, we want the writeup numbers for the previous months going how far back.

5:47 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  When did you start?

5:50 - Luke Gillespie
  October 21st.

5:51 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay, I think that's about when we stopped doing, when did we stop doing reporting, Oka? Or when would you think is like the last time you and I?

6:00 - Luke Gillespie
  I had solid numbers on write-ups and about yeah, so yeah, from when you started Luke, probably, okay, okay, I'm going to do that.  Obviously a more time intensive way would be to scroll back through all the client's slack channels and it wouldn't be that hard but just scrolling through looking at the dates of messages when write-ups were sent and they were manually writing that down.  Maybe you could copy and paste them to a chatbot and ask them. And if so, we're doing this because the HubSpot numbers aren't inaccurate, right, because stages are skipped when we're moving things, okay, okay, would have been nice because I've been keeping track of all the write-ups and my personal notes but every month I refresh it and clean off the list.  If we started again from the new month, so it would have been great if you kept your way.

6:57 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Maybe a little pain will incentivize you to do it going forward. He's like, don't you don't like it, but this is your reward for skipping steps, as you get to help, because you're the one that's going to know these numbers.  There is another place where write-ups exist that might be easier than the Slack Channels, where might that be?

7:16 - Luke Gillespie
  Notion. Notion. And that's where Onka comes. Onka, do you know of a way because mechanically, operationally, I don't know Notion very well, you know a way where we can look at all the clients and see when write-ups were created and how many for each client, but I'm sure Notion sounds like.

7:40 - Anke Badenhorst
  Well, yeah, you can go into each client's dashboard and then you'll have all the write-ups of the client. You can see it all.  Notion has dates of when the write-up was created, so you'll have the exact dates of when the write-up was created as well.

7:57 - Luke Gillespie
  So I will check out the Notion and Slack in make sure the numbers matched. When would you like that by if we know?

8:05 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  I mean, if they got a write-up, so it'll either be in like deal lost past or on their dashboard.  So I don't think you need to like double check it in Slack. I just need to get a number, a monthly number.  So from November, which is kind of when we dropped off and weren't getting the accurate reporting numbers, and all I need is write-up numbers.  So how many write-ups were done every month? So I imagine you'll be able to work through that pretty quick.

8:34 - Luke Gillespie
  I could do it by end of the tomorrow.

8:38 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Earlier it would be, because I would like to talk about it in team meeting is why I'm asking for it.  Yeah, could you get team meeting tomorrow? I need to do some calculations though. So could you do it 12 p.m.

8:54 - Luke Gillespie
  Central time? 12 p.m. time. That will be. I'm checking my time zone calculator thing here 12 p.m. time would be 11 a.m.  My time.

9:06 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, I can do that Okay, so I'm asking you to do something you hadn't planned so what my drop or not happen as a result of my request It's fine I had blank space at that from n to 11 a 11 to 10 to 11 a.m.

9:23 - Luke Gillespie
  had nothing to do I was just gonna be doing right up in sin so I can do that another time and I'll have a whole hour to get this done Okay, so but it's costing getting write-ups and reviewing sims It'll be okay.  I haven't done it. Don't worry and I can this is something that can be done really fast.

9:41 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  I got this Don't spend a ton of like if it's off by I don't want to give you the idea that it's okay to be off by numbers But I'm just trying to get a rough Yeah, as accurate picture as I can of how many write-ups we've been putting out a month Today Great cool that would be really  Really awesome, Luke. Thank you.

10:02 - Anke Badenhorst
  Okay, I'm going to send you a short 30 second video of two settings and just said on those dashboards to quickly give you what you need.

10:12 - Luke Gillespie
  Please do that. You're very open to sure.

10:15 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Thank you, Anka. Love this. Agendas are so great. Um, cool. Let me pull up the deal team numbers and see if I have any questions.  Um, or maybe you all can flag if there's anything of note, good or bad in the numbers this week.
  SCREEN SHARING: Athena started screen sharing - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/272936516?timestamp=635.718096

10:38 - Luke Gillespie
  Sure. I think, uh, first thing to flag. Maybe I'm such an optimist is we've got a lot of on market right up so far.  And as far as the numbers this morning, Anka mentioned that our off market numbers are already picking up from implementing new systems just, just this week, these recent few days is right.  Anka.

10:58 - Anke Badenhorst
  Yeah, um, especially these last two. weeks, we weren't last month, probably days went by without getting even one lead.  And these last two weeks, David got each and every day, except for yesterday, he got a lead to that, we get that he got pushed.  So we had this dry spell where we had no leads at all. And then this entire month, we got one lead per day.  Obviously, we want to get that hooked up. So that's not ideal. That is just like, yeah, there is a little bit of light in the tunnel.  And the right track, and it's going to pick up, we're going to we're going to keep on the traction that we have to get it picked up.

11:38 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Fantastic. Okay, there's going to be a lot of L.O.I.s be as well. So I want you all to keep on top of that, who's responsible for putting in these numbers.  Okay, let's celebrate the  out of this one, because who did it come from?

11:56 - Luke Gillespie
  S.T.

11:59 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  we remember us? He started with us. Y'all weren't around. Anka, share, share, like how monumental this is.

12:07 - Anke Badenhorst
  Hey guys, this is huge. Like with SP, they would, I think it took them four months to sign one write up because they were in the light package.  You guys remember, we told you guys about this. So it took them four months to sign one NDA, right?

12:24 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  And then I started out six months, Anka, and we should check.

12:27 - Anke Badenhorst
  Yes. To sign one NDA, and then we were like, guys, you're never going to get anywhere.

12:33 - Luke Gillespie
  You guys need the full package. They got on the full package.

12:36 - Anke Badenhorst
  And then it was Ryan, Athena, working with them, pulling them, poly, take the step. Take the meaning. Just take the meaning.  Take the step. Now they're doing financial modeling. They're putting out their submitting L.O. eyes. Like that is the equivalent of putting a man on the moon in my eyes for Stephen Paulie.  It's huge.

13:00 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah, and it shows how much value we provide, because without us, they'd still be signing one India every since months, you know.  I remember just months ago, Polly was afraid to do broker calls, and now she was doing seller meetings and other things.

13:15 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  That's Steve.

13:17 - Luke Gillespie
  Say that again?

13:18 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  On her own, without Steve.

13:20 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah, exactly.

13:21 - Anke Badenhorst
  That's the point.

13:22 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah, yeah. wouldn't do anything without Steve and Polly, I mean, Ryan had to have a talk with her to really woman up and help carry this relationship.  Christine was always so busy with what he did, and she followed through, and now they have an extra while.

13:37 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Maybe another one coming in on the cafeteria as well. The catering they are, catering they passed, so y'all need to be watching the calls, right?  So that's something that we need to figure out from the process standpoint, is who's reviewing the call notes and pulling the actions or the updates from that.  You don't need to figure it out now, but on your deal team meeting, add it to your agenda now to figure that out, right?  Because in all my calls, something, there was an action for you guys in every single one of them. So they passed on the catering business.  But this is huge. This is  huge. It should go on everybody's wind walls like well done. And on top of that, they are so delighted with the service they're receiving.  They see so much value in what we do. They love us. They champion us. They can't wait to get on acquiring minds and tell everybody that they did this because of us.  really happy clients. And that was the case with a lot of people that I was speaking to like Dustin and are over the moon.  And even came around and realized that it's his own head, like an expectation that we're doing everything we said and, you know, he's like,  Probably like, ah, it's just so expensive more than anything else I pay. I'm like, good luck doing this on your own.

15:07 - Anke Badenhorst
  Joe, same thing.

15:09 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  It just came out. It's life. It's not us. That's why he's leaving. know, um, Gil is really delighted and Gil's more confident, right?  Like he's, he's, he's disqualifying businesses for good reasons, but he's chasing brokers to get on calls now, right? Like, so he's seeing hair, but he's like, I want to talk to him.  It's awesome. And he's not even afraid to do financial modeling. Justin's really excited. Andrew's making offers, like it's  awesome.  So just want to, like, make sure we call that out. Um, cool. Any other numbers to note on market that I should be wearing?

15:50 - Luke Gillespie
  David, anything you want to bring up?

15:53 - David R
  Um, no, the only thing is about Jason. We had very low due for the last week for Jason because  because of misunderstanding with Massam, but he already, you know, solved the issue and he's picking up again the deal flow for Jay.  We expanded his searches yesterday and we got a lot of deals today for him.

16:17 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Fantastic. Okay. even though we don't do priority clients, it sounds like we had a bottleneck that we need to clear up for him.

16:24 - Luke Gillespie
  So Luke, I'm assuming you're jumping on those. Yep.

16:29 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Great. then there are no priority clients. if they paid us money, they are a priority. So same thing with like Brian, I just think that's a good learning, right?  Like we don't write off clients, you know, and even though it feels like we should, we don't write them off.  If they're doing the things they've paid us money, we're all here getting paid because they've given us money. we take care of them.  last day. Okay. So I need to be better about shielding my frustrations with them. because I don't want that to color how you guys handle clients and deal with clients.  We treat them all. There's the reason why we do the flat feet. We can treat them all the same and we don't favor clients and we don't treat them differently.  Some of them have different levels of how much they engage, but they shouldn't be punished if they're doing the things that we ask them to do.

17:20 - Luke Gillespie
  True.

17:23 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Great. Cool. Anything else on here? So right up, we're a little bit lower than we were last week. How are we looking on rounding out the week, Luke?

17:35 - Luke Gillespie
  Um, I sent us, look at the screen show, Athena, remember that I do not look at Thursday's numbers because Thursday's numbers are only like half a day's number.

17:48 - Anke Badenhorst
  So this is only looking at three days numbers.

17:51 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Got it. Okay.

17:52 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah. I have at least two more right up. So going to do tomorrow. I have an AH1 and a GL1.  So as far as where we're at with specific clients, everyone's everyone is on a good path right now. Everyone has at least one or more.  Some even have three except S.P. and Jason have nine so far.

18:13 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  OK, how are we able to get S.P. or happy? But Jason, we need to get on top of. So are we able to get anything out for him before the end of the week?

18:24 - Luke Gillespie
  I I could, but it would take some chasing and prioritizing Jason. I just I just push something to schedule a call with.  OK, I have two. Yeah, I could I could call some broker when make something happen by tomorrow.

18:47 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Let's do that. What were you saying, Anka?

18:51 - Anke Badenhorst
  I was just going to remind Luke that Ida was extremely excited about some sims that she got for Jason.  Yes, I think it was last night. She told. me and David that she's really excited about some Sims that she got for Jason.  Yeah, I reviewed them all today.

19:08 - Luke Gillespie
  Question.

19:13 - Anke Badenhorst
  I think there's new ones that came in because there is two Sims in two Jason, one Jason Sims or the other one I was judging.  There is a new Jason Sim in Sim received.

19:26 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah, I already reviewed that. I'm just waiting for the broker to get by his financials in this scene.

19:33 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay, so with Jason, I've introduced him to Elliot Holland, who is quite an influencer in this market. Elliot doesn't really understand what we do.  Yeah, it's a call that I hope Anka has scheduled already, but so he and I are going to have more of  conversation about what it is that we offer. But remember his first interaction with any of our clients is Jason.  And Jason's telling him he's looked, he's only looked at one deal. And he's only got one active deal. So, which is true, he's only got one active deal right now.  Because Elliot was like, you need to walk away from the off market, tell him like you're not doing anything until you get financials and start working your other deals.  And Jason's like, I don't about the service that we're offering.

20:31 - Luke Gillespie
  Exactly.

20:38 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  we have it's reputational management now also. So, it's not that I'm prioritizing Jason is that Elliot could be a really great object hit and resource and partner for us.  So, you know, if he's like, work your other deals and he's like, I have no other deals that are paying the service.  And so, that's why I want to, I want to like make sure sure that let's just drown Jason before he leaves.

21:06 - Luke Gillespie
  Um, so just an update on that thing.

21:08 - Anke Badenhorst
  Um, David, how many RFI's were you able to push for Jason this morning?

21:12 - David R
  Because you're muted. Okay.

21:18 - Anke Badenhorst
  Sorry guys, I muted myself because I started coughing.

21:21 - Luke Gillespie
  Um, on that note, David, how many RFI's did you push for Jason?

21:27 - Anke Badenhorst
  Because, um, Athena, after David, uh, expanded Jason parameters, we had the, uh, he, he had a song steam to a backdiding of all of the active deals in those new parameters about, uh, what did you do David two or three months, three months.  So there should be a big influx of Jason deals coming through, um, as a result of that.

21:53 - David R
  Yes. So I pushed seven so far, but I still have a lot of deals to look at. And there is one high, some mediums and then some looks.

22:11 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So can you. Also, if there's, if there's a backlog of Jason deals, maybe just like prioritized to review all those and push those.  I'd love to send Jason an update tomorrow. And just say, hey, since you expanded the criteria after your conversation with Athena.  Just so you know, we've, you know, identified and pushed. However many to our five. Now there's obviously a process that it goes through for us to.  You know, do that, but that's, that's a good sign. So we expect to be some deals that will be put in front of you as a result of that.  So if we show them a little bit more of our work while we're getting the reporting done, then that can, you know.  Be to our favor, right. So once we get the RFI number, just a little message, just undo, like, hey, Jason, we've expanded your criteria, we've asked for information on this many deals.  Typically, know, we see a conversion rate of whatever, or if we have this many, we can expect to see this many opportunities.  Just look at your guys' conversion rate of like RFI to write up or eat us for Jason, right? Have her plug those numbers in and tell you like how many we can expect based on RFI.  It wasn't one out, so you can just manage his expectations there. But he doesn't seem to think we're doing anything over here.  So that's why the reporting is also useful because it makes your life easier. Look, and we can't report if we don't have clean numbers.  So when they see like, oh, wow, you guys are looking at tens of thousands of deals just for me every month, like, holy , I'm so glad I don't have to do that.  We stopped doing the reporting because we couldn't get you or Ryan or everybody else to track the data and we can't, I can't send  numbers to clients.  So, um, it just makes them appreciate more of what we do. So I know it sucks to have to, you know, do some of these manual stuff, but like, there's a, there's a reason why, and it's not just to have numbers for the sake of having numbers.

24:26 - David R
  Yes.

24:28 - Anke Badenhorst
  Just to clarify, Tina, did you ask David or me to send that message to Jason when we, when we have the numbers?

24:35 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Um. Um, I think it would be good for David to do it because he's doing the work and they don't know that he's on.

24:48 - David R
  I mean, I don't think they've had a lot of interactions with him. So David, would you feel comfortable doing that?  Yeah, okay. Yeah, I can do it. Okay, Jason, I'm responsible for your incoming.

25:00 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  just to let you know, we widen your search and sent this many and we can expect to, know, like this is an estimate, but based on past, you know, performance, we would expect that we might get this many deals in front of you as a result of that.  Because Jason hasn't like fully decided whether he's going to cancel with us or not. So he wants to hear from us every day.  Okay, I'd love to be sending her right up a day, but we know that's not possible, but at least showing him that we're taking the, you know, he asked us to change the deal criteria, we've taken action, we've already done this, we can expect to see this, you know, like we can estimate that maybe this would happen.  And then it also shows him like all the people on the team that are working on his behalf.

25:48 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah, right, we got this statement, it's good. So we can see another face, someone that's working for his deals.

25:55 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, I believe in you. I wouldn't ask you to do it if I didn't think you could handle it.  So if who are nervous, have Anka review it or have Luke review it before you send it if you feel like you need that.  don't think you will, but that's what we're all here for, right? So yeah. All right. Excellent. Okay. Good. Any more on the numbers?  we move on to the next agenda item?

26:22 - Luke Gillespie
  Okay.

26:23 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Cool. So next thing I wanted to talk about was voice notes for clients. So you all have seen that I've been utilizing that to give them feedback.  And I'm encouraging them to do the same. And I did on the call, but something Luke and Anka and Paul Ryan to do it as well, is like when we're asking for feedback, we can remind them like, Hey, if it's easier, you can leave a voice note for us, because I think if we remove the barrier,  It is I  hate typing, especially now that I wear these ridiculous nails on my hand, you know, like, it's really hard.  And if I could, I would do meetings and I would communicate by voice all the time. And actually on the phone, I do voice to text anyway, which is why some of my messages look crazy, because it's whatever they interpreted, you know, text message.  So, but anyway, we can make their lives a little bit easier and also get what we want, which is feedback, we want their questions.  want to know what's happening. So just reminding them. And so Luke, you've been  awesome on being on top of them and, you know, giving them advice and, you know, asking them for feedback and teeing up, gail, like, hey, so Athena can prepare it.  Like, that was awesome. So just reminding them, like, hey, if it's easier, click the little microphone, or if they're having problems with the modeling and want to get on a call, like, I mean, I'm losing my mind trying to, like, get responsible.  to all of them, it doesn't necessarily need a meaning. We can teach them like, hey, click the record button, select your screen, and show us what's going on.  We'll be able to get you a quicker answer than trying to schedule a call or jump on a call, right?  Because Ryan is not reputable at the moment. I have very limited bandwidth, but it is far more easier to listen to a quick voice note and do a response and wait to schedule a call and do that sort of thing.

28:28 - Luke Gillespie
  So let's use these awesome tools at Earth Slack and remind clients that they can do that too. Yeah, exactly.  But I'm assuming that we have them send audio messages, but we still send text messages because that's a better experience for them.  It's easier to receive a text message than to receive an audio message.

28:46 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  But it transcribes it automatically. So even if we send a voice note, I mean, yes, Luke, for you, type it up, that's fine.  For me and Ryan, you know, because we're busy and sometimes it's like, especially when we're dealing with playing with like negotiation and stuff like that, it's I feel like it's sometimes better for me to give coaching over voice and choose whether they read it or not.  That's why I had the broker calls transcribed in the first place because I'm like, I'm gonna want to listen so I can hear the nuance and everything that's going on.  But other people will want to just read it, you know, and even Eli did that, they just read every broken call.  And then I'd be like, you need to, you know, sometimes I'd be like, Hey, you need to go and listen to it, which would be helpful, like to be able to get that information quickly, they can read it.  But Slack automatically transcribes it.

29:34 - Luke Gillespie
  So then people can choose whether they want to listen or whether they want to read. Yeah.

29:38 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  And what did we, what did we learn about learning styles?

29:43 - Luke Gillespie
  Yes.

29:46 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  And then it's, you know, so I, it's like from us, yes, I think we need to be thinking about how we help Ryan, like interact with clients better.  I don't know if he's he's thought about like just sending a quick like screen share a video note or voice note to them like he's he's quick to jump on the calls but what's not happening is he's not recording the calls and then none of us know what's happening afterwards so we need to work on that too.  Anka and that should have been on this list but like it is not okay ever to have a client meeting and not record it because then we can't know what happens and we can't give them the notes so um any questions on that or that all sound cool sounds good great and then Luke I think we already talked about this last time but just asking for tax returns every time yep I added it to my a tax thank you um broker deal bashing so this is some feedback for you Luke um I've been listening to you a lot of your loom videos and they're awesome so you already picked up on this with the language that I changed for um  Lindsay on some of the stuff. So you just want to be really careful about the language that you use when describing deal because you will do what if you do too much negativity.

31:12 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah, obviously subconsciously influence the clients and make them get some bad news.

31:17 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, so there's been a lot of like bashing the brokers in your calls and I imagine that's coming from a place of you not wanting to look like you didn't do your job and get all the information.  And then that sort of thing. So it's coming from a good place, but I think there's a different way of reframing it.  So it's not bashing the broker because everybody already has a very negative feeling towards brokers. Just trying to wait a turn it into a positive right like hey, know broker was a little light in their knowledge on this one, but in my experience that's a plus because it means they'll it'll be a direct line to the sellers in this case so you can develop a relationship.  So I know there's a little bit like more light. info that we normally given that, but it means that you probably will be able to get it straight from the source.

32:05 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah, that's a good way to say you're right. And when I saw this on the agenda list, I knew exactly what you were going to want to talk about.  I've just been trying to be as honest and upfront and realistic as possible. You know, sometimes I say, hey, know, there's some pros and cons to this deal, but I get it.  should try to be more sales and not this because especially customers like Dustin and Lindsey, they just heard one broker call and they didn't like the way the bros are talking.  So they didn't pursue that. So I got a tread lightly on these things.

32:34 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, and you picked up her political leanings are maybe different than some of us hold. So like hearing the word girls, she'll be like, back here.

32:42 - Luke Gillespie
  then I like, I don't know.

32:43 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  And also, I don't want her to feel any way towards you also, right? So like, there's so much psychology in what we do.  literally, and this is why I harp on language, right? matters. Like if or when, like. like, if I become an editor, no, when you become an ogre, right?  It's not, it's not an if, it's a when. So these words are, and you went through boot camps, you know what I'm like with words.  So we just have to be careful. And when you see how much these writeups cost, I think you will be a lot more careful with how you present them because it's a lot of  money that goes into every single writeup.  Right. And we want, we do not want them to be like, man, I don't like it because the broker didn't give information and he's a bad broker.  So no broker is a bad broker. Right. If we're working with them, because what are they going to us for?

33:37 - Luke Gillespie
  The brain biosphere.

33:40 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  No, what are, what are our clients coming to us for?

33:43 - Luke Gillespie
  Oh, to help deal with the broker basically. even if it is a bad broker, we can make it a good broker as well.

33:51 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Well, technically we're not putting them in front of bad brokers, right? Like we're weeding out anybody that is like genuinely shouldn't do business with.

34:01 - Luke Gillespie
  And then we're helping them navigate how to deal with the rest.

34:04 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  no one is a bad broker if we are putting it right in front of them, because we shouldn't be putting right ups in front of people if it is a bad broker.

34:12 - Luke Gillespie
  Correct.

34:16 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So find ways to turn it into opportunity or just point out like, Hey, know, burgers come in all shapes and sizes.  This one's a little light on their understanding of the deal, but that's an opportunity because that usually means that you're able to develop a relationship with a seller as opposed to a broker that's not going to let you ever talk to him unless you submit an ally.

34:38 - Luke Gillespie
  So we kind of like this, right?

34:40 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So don't be like you're going to be probably be able to talk directly to the seller.

34:46 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah, exactly. No, you're right. That's normally exactly how it works with the workers. No, no reason. Yeah. I guide you to be better with my words.  Thanks for having that up.

34:56 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  And then another thing that you do, which I don't know if you're aware of, but like If you point out problems with the business website or the business itself, you're like, yeah, they're SEOs.  This is a horrible website and SEO is terrible, know, so it's like, careful. Just say, you know, seller obviously has some modernization opportunities here.  That's something that you can think about and something that would be a quick win for you to bring this into the, you know, into like modern SEO practices, but it's an upside that they've been able to get the performance and the numbers that they do, given that they have a little bit more old school kind of techniques with their marketing, right?  Always think about where it's an opportunity. So we're pointing something out, right? But we're not saying like, this is a  website with bad SEO, because they'll be like, ah, scary.  I don't want to work with, you know, like, so it's like, hey, you know, they don't, they clearly don't really need this website to do the performance that they do.  But hey, that's an awkward. opportunity for you. just, oh, I always think about it. Like, I don't want to not point something out that could be a problem or an issue.  But I am also aware that all of them are highly risk-averse at various levels of like understanding of what the like, so we're always looking for like, how can we help them overcome these challenges?  Because we know there's going to be five million challenges as they go through this process. So if we start priming them early on that every challenge or issue is an opportunity or something that they can, you know, it's solvable unless, like, if it's a deal breaker, we wouldn't be putting it in front of them.

36:40 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah, good point. Yeah, just overall, the same thing was just selling the deal. Yeah.

36:49 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Hey, I don't know if selling is the right word, maybe, for you to wrap your head around the concept that I'm just that.

36:55 - Luke Gillespie
  You're doing all of that.

37:00 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  work into service because you're doing really good work on these write-ups so and the videos are really helpful right to get up to speed really quickly see what you saw in them so you're doing all your work into service by like pointing out the flaws and the problems you know and it's like I think you're doing it because you don't want to them to think you're putting a bad business in front of them or not getting the information that you're supposed to get so like just be like hey you know like isn't it cool that the business has been able to get these kinds of numbers with a website like this like this might be something you want to dig into as an opportunity for yourself and see if this is really a problem but you know this isn't the kind of website that you would probably want to have for the business like I'm pointing out a problem without making them think like oh and you got to bear in mind to a lot of these folks ego even if they wouldn't admit it they have illustrious careers right so to step into  something that can be a barrier for them too if they think it's going to like look like a long move when they've they've had all this accomplishment in their career.

38:12 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah, just presenting things in a positive life, positive bias. If we're putting it in front of them, it's a good deal.  Yeah, truth.

38:22 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So we can we can we can showcase where there might be problems or areas concerned or whatever without like planning a seed that this is a bad deal for them or like a bad broker or like an ugly business.  know, it's like, , they're about to take over that business, Luke.

38:43 - Luke Gillespie
  You don't want to talk  about the website.

38:46 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  I step into the shoes and be the owner of that business. So somebody's like, yeah, this is so ugly and horrible.

38:52 - Luke Gillespie
  It's like, I don't want to be in a business or something ugly and horrible, know, like, yeah, you're all.

39:00 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Um, but it's an opportunity for them to improve things. So we can point things out without without making them feel a certain way about it.  So, and this is good learnings for everybody, right? Like, even though we might talk a little  behind the scenes amongst ourselves, like need to be mindful that there's, there's an internal discussion.  And then there's a client-facing way that we talk. And I have been doing it for so long. And that that's, that's a lens that I need to, like, get y'all to, to toot, right?  Like, so we, like, when you're at the eye doctor, they're going to click into different things. do different, we see, see things differently.  I don't know if that's a good analogy. So sometimes my analogy sucks. Um, we're going to talk differently to clients and we will to each other sometimes.  And we need to be cognizant of what the client-facing communications look like versus us. know, and it's okay for us to be like, man, this sucks.  But when I talk to the client, I'm going to make sure that I point this out. out and done it out of that.

40:01 - Luke Gillespie
  So there's new wants to it. Right? Yeah, exactly. Thanks.

40:05 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  And you all are super professional and everything. So Luke, I know you like feedback and that's why I'm giving it to you.  Yeah.

40:13 - Luke Gillespie
  Cool.

40:14 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  JG, JJ, JJ, I think you already gave me an update, didn't you?

40:18 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah, I gave you a little video, nothing that you will know on JG, those three deals that you've already talked to him about on Buyers Club and JJ just has this one RV company that I believe she did a in-person visit today.  Hopefully she says something in the stock channel, but yeah.

40:35 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  What's my answer to her? She brings up again that she has not seen her off-market business in six months of being a client of ours.

40:47 - Luke Gillespie
  Well, yeah, it's a good question. And she's been a really tough market, even for on-market. That's what brokers have told me, even in the on-market they see  Ohio is a very slow and dry marketplace, and yeah, we haven't got anything off the market for her.

41:13 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Anchor, David, any insights for me?

41:22 - Luke Gillespie
  You can talk about how the team's been doing extra things to increase her outreach in Ohio, which I believe are often working with, and particularly focusing on increasing searches for Ohio for January, and I mean, that's a tough question to answer, but I would just bring up how dry her market is even for our market, and that's what I've been told on multiple calls by brokers.  When I asked like, what's up with Ohio, and they operate in multiple different states, and they tell me, Ohio is a very dry state, is what I've been told.

41:57 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So, I don't ever blame the clients for things.

42:00 - Luke Gillespie
  Because if we're honest with ourselves, so we've done absolutely everything we can to get her off-market deals, then we're not in a position to blame her market.

42:16 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So, why have we not put a deal in front of her? And what are we doing about it? Because I'm the one that has to have the tough conversation with the clients, right?

42:25 - Luke Gillespie
  When they get Athena time, guess what? Yeah, yeah.

42:30 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Do we know for sure that we've had multiple conversations with her telling her that this is the reason?

42:37 - Luke Gillespie
  Is her market? Not that I know of, because I am too close to Jenny. Ryan's had the combo with her.  know specifically for on-market about expanding your location. don't know how to cover an off-market as well. I can guarantee you that Ryan's had that combo with her about, and she understands.  and how dry her on market at least. I don't know if there's been an off-market conversation.

43:10 - Anke Badenhorst
  Well, in the deal team meeting tomorrow, we can analyze, we can take a look at J.J. specifics, deal in the off-market pipeline and in the campaigns, and see if we can, if we, how many is in the pipeline if we can pick up if there is something, a problem, a blocker.  We are doing the extra sequences for doing an additional IV tasting for her as well. But to answer your question, Athena, no, we have definitely not done everything possible, but we are going to look at the pipeline and see what's up.

43:55 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay. So, another reason why someone needs to own The follow up after these calls that Ryan or I have with the clients is that she brought this up.  I'm going to say at least a month ago. she asked this question, which we know, do we know, like regardless of whether we're hitting our minimums.  Perception is what. So the client has a perception that she's not getting value and she expressed that by saying, why have I not seen any off market deals.  And she said that. I'm guessing at least a month ago. At which point the team did what exactly.

44:42 - David R
  We created the hops for some pain for her. a three weeks ago. It's not responding very well. We only got like.  or leads there. Are we working on those leads? They're not like very hot leads right now.

45:06 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay, cool. So we've done something, but I'm not chastising you all either, but this is this is where I'm pointing out like our system needs to have a full loop because a client expressed something she's at the six month mark.  How seriously did we actually like on saying we can like look at now and analyze it, but I would have really loved that the team to like and like, hey, we need to do this.  Like she's she's at the six month mark. She just perception is reality. She's gotten zero off market deals and she's expressing that she's not happy with our service without saying that directly.  So how, you know, when we get these notes from the calls and these feedback from the client, how do we like lock into action and figure out like what's going on and what we're going to do about it before they cancel?  So I don't know what the answer is, right? owns that? Because when nobody owns it, nothing gets done. And we saw what happened with Andrew's campaign.  nobody was owning that. So the ball got dropped and we refunded money, which we're not in position to do.  I don't want to do that again. So when we get these sorts of things, it's like, okay, who can own this aspect of it?  How do we take this feedback from clients and incorporate it into our process and look into it and make sure that we're actioning it?  Because it's like something was said to Ryan. Everybody's just a student who take care of it or something's happening, which is normal, right?  When nobody has accountability, that's why I harp on it about it. how do you guys all have like, you know, now you know in that spreadsheet, who's responsible for putting those numbers in that thing?  Because if nobody's initials are against it, who's going to update it?

47:00 - Luke Gillespie
  You know what I mean?

47:02 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  And again, it's not chastising you while it's pointing out an area where we can improve with we've got some legitimate client feedback.  We know that they're about to drop off. It is not only a financial risk, but a reputational risk to lose clients before we've gotten them under Alawai.  So as long as they're like Stephen Polly and they're like, this is great. We're getting so much about awesome.  know, we don't want to give them less attention or service to the happy clients. Right. And that's what I don't want.  I don't want the Jason's getting all of the attention, because the other clients aren't shouting up when they're unhappy.  Jenny expressed that she was unhappy without straight up saying it like Jason does.

47:42 - Anke Badenhorst
  Yep. I completely agree with you. If you know like what David said is, yes, we did do the A.B.  tasting for JJ. But I thought we were just doing it because of the six month mark. I wasn't aware that we were doing it for the fact that she was.  that she expressed it so I absolutely see what you're saying we need to be a full loop and have everybody be aware of what's going on with the clients because what's happening at this moment is only Ryan's aware of what's going on with the clients so even doing the numbers even for Luke can eat out doing the numbers it's hard for them to do all of those numbers because they're not aware of what happens with the clients so in tomorrow's Ben team poll we will brainstorm a solution for this we will present it to Ryan on Monday so he's also aware of it he can give his feedback and what he thinks about it and then we'll feedback that solution to you on how we're going to be implementing this.

48:41 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Great and feel free to suggest things to him too right like I didn't know he's not recording every client call that's like not okay so like Ryan how do we set your settings up so it's automatically doing it you know there's a way to do that further yeah like you guys make  This is what you need from him, and I will ask him to watch this call, too. So he knows where we're at, so that he's part of this.  He's just not here. So it's OK to say, Ryan, we need to do this, this and this, and this is what we're presenting, and this is what we think the solution is, what do you think, right?  And then he's like, yes, or how about this? Or, you know, it takes the burden of him figuring out the solution.  Because ultimately, you guys are going to be the ones implementing it.

49:29 - Luke Gillespie
  So you want to come up with something that you like, and you need to tell him what you need from him to make it happen.  Yeah, I also was not aware that Jenny had said something about Mark through deals. But Ryan has been pushing off market for JJ and Kevin recently.  But yeah, I wasn't aware that she had brought it up.

49:49 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, so Anka, I was, I was, I did a really good like recap for me yesterday. I'm like, everything that happened in the client panels.  And I was like, , like, can we. find a bot or something that does this for everybody, right? So it's like pulling the recording notes, it's, you know, all the discussions that we're having and all the different threads and it's just like create a daily update somehow, you know, and I know I've seen Slack bots before that summarize channels and stuff like that.  So I know Slack has a whole bunch of tools and Y'all, Anka has a shitload on her plate. So she's, you know, managing this whole hiring process and we're hiring two people and she's my EA.  And you know, my personal assistant is not going to be working anymore as of Monday, like as I'm moving and all this stuff.  So don't, like if you could take some of the burden off her while we hire these people and get them up to speed to get her the bandwidth, like if you have ideas or ways that we can solve this, like don't feel like it's just her job to figure this out to is my request.  I'm envisioning that there must be a tool or something that we can implement that like scans all the client channels, all the transcripts or something.  gives us a daily update somehow, so we all know it's going on with the clients. And then might reduce the amount of time we need to spend on these calls.

51:10 - Anke Badenhorst
  Yeah, because these calls will turn into solutions and not updates, because the updates will have happened already. Everybody will have had time to think of solutions and these calls will just be brainstorming sessions talking about the solutions because the updates will happen already.  Great idea. Amazing.

51:30 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Uncle loves it. Winner. I have to get y'all bought it, otherwise, you know, this is going to feel like necessary stuff.  So I love when that happens. Okay, cool. We're nearly there. I know, I know the client call with him.  He's very happy, y'all. When, when we talked about the retail store, he had some specifics to take off the deal box in relation to the retail heavy, you know, face to face stores and that sort of thing.  So just something for you all to pay attention to and update. And then Jason, we've already done the deal box update.  So that's great. Thank you for actioning that so quickly. Okay, so Ryan's back on Monday. I am going to be off moving into my new home on Monday.  So what kind of handover should we be giving Ryan and who would like to take the lead on pulling that together?  don't necessarily need to do all the work, but get the relevant people to do their work. So Ryan has a very comprehensive handover of everything that happened when he comes back on Monday.
  ACTION ITEM: Prepare summary of ongoing deals for Ryan's handover doc - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/272936516?timestamp=3167.9999  So you can hit the ground running.
  ACTION ITEM: Prepare off-market deal pipeline update for Ryan's handover doc - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/272936516?timestamp=3179.9999

53:00 - Luke Gillespie
  that are going on with deals, that'll pretty much be me. can have a little summary document for Ryan on what's going on with everything.  I might need you, Athena, to help me fill in some gaps there. that can probably be me. And then if there's anything with off-market deals, things like that, know, pipeline stuff, that's gonna be David and I'll out to the evening, right?
  ACTION ITEM: Create+share Google Doc in deal team channel for Ryan's handover, w/ tabs per client - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/272936516?timestamp=3198.9999

53:24 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Wonka, where would be the best place for us all to collaborate on this?

53:30 - Anke Badenhorst
  Google Doc will definitely be the best place to collaborate on this. I'll get one set up and I'll share it in the deal team channel.  And then everybody can collaborate on this. I'll make taps for each different client, so it's easy to navigate between them and it's not just everybody on one page going up and down.

53:47 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Cool. How quickly can you get that out? Cause I would like to add some stuff already.

53:52 - Anke Badenhorst
  I can get that up in 30 seconds, right after the school.

53:56 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Why don't you do it right after this call and then let's start feeding it. I find handover. are better to do in the moment rather than waiting until the end.  So if there's things that are relevant that Ryan needs to know that happened, right, just start dropping it in there.  So then come Monday, he's got a good understanding of what's going on. Like, here's the numbers, here's what happened with the clients, cetera, cetera.  I'm going to start cracking the riff on handovers. And I'm going to, I need to be clear and set some expectations on what should be in handovers.  When we go on vacation. So I'm going to be doing that because if we don't do, and again, this feels like one of those process things like that.  But if we don't do handovers, then it leaves people in the . And that's not cool either. Like, we want everybody to be like, yes, go on vacation.  It's great. if we do nice things for each other to make that easy to both go on vacation for the teams that are left behind, and for somebody to come back on vacation and feel like they can.  and hit the ground running rather than trying to figure out what the hell happened while they were away, then it makes us all more likely to want to encourage each other to go on vacation, right?  So it's due all of our benefit to do that. And it saves a hell of a lot of resource and time that we don't have for somebody trying figure out what happened when they came back to.
  ACTION ITEM: Add review of Ryan's handover doc to tomorrow's team meeting agenda - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/272936516?timestamp=3314.9999

55:21 - Anke Badenhorst
  Yep.

55:25 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Luke. OK, Anka, you're going to do that. Let's start feeding into it. And then we'll, Anka, can you remind me in tomorrow's team meeting to just have a quick scan of it to make sure we're assigned any last minute things that we need to get ready for Ryan's return on Monday?
  ACTION ITEM: Send video re: interesting deal question in deal team channel - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/272936516?timestamp=3349.9999

55:44 - Anke Badenhorst
  OK, I already blocked out a few holds on Ryan's calendar. going to send that over to Chris to get Chris booked on Ryan's calendar.

55:56 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Great. OK, awesome. Luke, you had two things for me.

56:00 - Luke Gillespie
  Yes, I realize the first one was a deal question and that's what we talked about sending room videos for so we can not be done on this call I'll send you a little video about that.  It was just a interesting deal I wanted to be with thoughts on the segment can just and you want to pause.

56:12 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Let me pause Normally that's what this the so the purpose of this deal review meeting Is for me to impart wisdom on to all of you because I am still the subject matter expert and that is a bottleneck in a That I don't want in this business, right?  So my my aim of this meeting is A to get an idea of what's going on So if we start doing like what won't get just got so it's so excited about then this meeting is about brainstorming collaborating and Me sharing the wisdom that everybody does where we have y'all joined the buyers club the buyer's club is not just for clients the intention Was to try to get you all up skilled too so that it's not a risk like if at the end  And it gets sick, which, man, it happened earlier this year. And I never thought I'd get that sick. But I was like offline, right?  And so if clients are in the middle of trying to close deals, and I'm the only one that knows how to do it, huge risk, right?  We don't want that.

57:13 - Anke Badenhorst
  So this call is the intention.

57:16 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So you were aware is to get the  buyers club and this call is to get the  out of my head into your head so that you all like up level and become subject matter experts as well, which seems to be working.  Because you did a pretty good job of answering all the clients this week. So yeah, you can bring those things to this meeting, like putting it in the agenda.  I want to talk to you about this deal and get your thoughts on this deal because it's a benefit to everybody to learn that.  Because then it's not just like, oh, only Athena and Ryan know how to do all this stuff. Guess what?  We want to take vacation to.

57:53 - Luke Gillespie
  And don't want Ryan to take vacation and maybe the only one that can do his job because it's been really stressful this week.

58:00 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  and you've alleviated a lot of that by being able to jump in. So that's appreciated because we're still a small team.  So when someone takes off, it's a big load on everybody else that's left.

58:11 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah, no, understand. I can get into the deal.

58:16 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  so we're a little bit over on time today. Send me a video for now, but do it in the deal team channel.  But in future, these meetings are exactly for that. That's what I want you to do is bring those discussion points so that I can fill your heads.  And ideally, for at a point, I don't need to get involved and deals are just closing without my input.  That's my aim. Awesome. means that this business isn't dependent on me, which I don't want it to be.

58:45 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah. No, you're right. And once we hopefully start implementing the agenda system better, these meetings will be pop, pop, pop, you know.  okay, yeah, so that's the awesome deal. And then the second thing I wanted to ask to tell you. This was a short update for when you're like preparing for a client call and you want to know where they're at what deals they're working on.  The notion dashboard is the most accurate. I assume you are already checking that. So generally, any deals on there are going to be pretty accurate as of today.  If you are, if you're ever confused or have any questions or think maybe it doesn't look very accurate past me because there may be some discrepancies, but for the most part, that's going to be your most accurate gauge of what clients are at.

59:28 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So who's responsible for updating the notion dashboards when stages move?

59:33 - Luke Gillespie
  that us or the clients? So when the right of completed, I move it into the right of completed stage.  And after that, I genuinely don't know. I think it's kind of both Ryan and the clients, Anka. think you know better than I.  I see the clients move it sometimes I see Ryan move it sometimes. I just see the email notification from the notion.

59:52 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So I don't really know. Right. So that's not the most up to date for me, which is why I'm asking for updates because I don't have time to scan all the channels and see what  whether a deal is lost or whether they got a seller meeting, because I know that Notion isn't updated regularly.  So I already have a distrust of it. don't know what stage it's at or whether a client passed on a deal.  Oh, wow. Disappeared while he's drinking his water.

1:00:18 - Anke Badenhorst
  OK.

1:00:21 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So while I appreciate that suggestion, the reason why I'm asking for updates is because I don't trust it.

1:00:26 - Luke Gillespie
  Yes.

1:00:29 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  And I don't have to call her what happened, you know, on the seller meeting, where the staff sort of thing.

1:00:35 - Luke Gillespie
  What I mean is just it's on the dashboard versus in lost. That's probably pretty accurate. But what stage it's on, so we're meeting, bro, if meeting.  I don't even look at that side of the dashboard. I only look at my side of the dashboard, so yeah.

1:00:48 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Anka, another one for your list when we've got you fully on operations, which is soon.

1:00:53 - Luke Gillespie
  Y'all, they accepted. She starts on Monday. So good for you, think.

1:01:10 - Anke Badenhorst
  Yeah, I already solved it. So it's on the list. It's already solved.

1:01:14 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  It's on the list. Fantastic. Okay. And yeah, a lot of this stuff. mean, some of it's urgent, of it's going to come after Kate's rockin' and rollin' in Anka's face, and this is the exact things that we're getting.  Like, we wanted to have Anka on, and she hasn't had the bandwidth as like process operations, you know, that whole thing.  Like, how do we just make it easier? Because for me, Luke, I'm on meetings from 8 a.m. until 6 p.m.  every day, so like a quick two-minute video from you is what I need in order to get up to speed, because I literally do not have the time to go in a slack and try to figure out what's going on.  It's not me like ignoring the channels. just, I don't have the capacity to do it. Most times which is frustrating because I would love to spend more time there and it's nice like getting in there and hearing the winds from the quiet and supporting them, but the way, you know, the things on my list right now or outside of the day to day with the clients, but I'm doing it because Ryan's not here right now.

1:02:21 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah, exactly. I understand. I can send them your doors when I will.

1:02:26 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Thank you. They're super helpful. thank you. Um, cool. Okay.

1:02:30 - David R
  David had one last question and then we will get out of here. Yeah. I wanted to know about the SBA loan from Canadian company because I've seen some deals from Canada.  So that will be nice to explore that possibility.

1:02:44 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yay. Cool. Okay. So as long as it's relocatable, ideally because I don't think our clients are wanting to move to Canada.  So if it's like a remote business, then that is something that our clients want could consider and they might not know it.  So not all SBA letters can do this, but Jared, who, Anka, I need to follow up with him, Mr.  Johnson from First Internet Bank, their bank has a program where they can take Canadian tax returns and basically put it through some system to make it work as US tax returns.  And then assuming the buyer is going to be buying the assets and moving it into the US, right? they can't move to Canada and buy a Canadian business with SBA if the intention isn't to bring it over to the US.

1:03:42 - David R
  So it has to be right okay level.

1:03:46 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Sorry that word is hard for me. So it has to be the way and then.

1:03:53 - David R
  So is this the only condition or is there anything else?

1:03:58 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  We're gonna have that. mean they're gonna how to have Canadian tax returns that back up whatever financial numbers that they need.  So this is where Luke, again, can ask for tax returns and Luke, good information for you to hear brokers are like, it's not as be eligible.  It's like, no, we actually, it is just a lot of lenders won't touch Canadian businesses, but we know lenders that will, they have to have the Canadian tax returns, though, to be able to, you know, turn it into an SBA system.  And this is best for businesses that like the one, are you familiar with the deal that Andrew's working right now off market?

1:04:34 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah.

1:04:35 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah. I mean, like, how ideal is that his clients are like, all of his customers are American, he charges an American dollars half his team is American, he just happens to be located in Canada.  So and it's a remote online business. So that's perfect because Andrew's doing, it's an asset purchase, right? a stock purchase.  So he's buying the assets and he's moving it into an American entity. Sounds I was like, Andrew's going to ideally for go SBA altogether, though, and use private debt on this one, if he can, but SBA is an option, which is  awesome now that we found it out.  But yeah, it needs to be for an American company, meaning everything has got to come over to America, and that's probably going to work best for digital businesses.  Because I imagine if it's like, oh, it's a, it's a three p.l. You know, like a third party, what does the L stand for?

1:05:34 - David R
  Third party logistics, right?

1:05:37 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Like, what kind of nightmare is that going to be moving all the inventory across the border right now? So physical stuff in Canada, I'd imagine like that, that's not going to go down to well with the tariffs and everything else.  But digital business, yeah, that's, I don't think anybody else is looking there and or knows this, so that's what I want us to be known for that we find  and nobody else finds and we make it work.

1:06:06 - David R
  So when it comes to digital businesses, do they have to have clients in the US?
  ACTION ITEM: Verify BCQ includes question on openness to international customers - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/272936516?timestamp=3973.9999

1:06:14 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, I mean, it just depends. And I think we ask this in the business characteristics questionnaire, Anka, if they're open to international customers?

1:06:26 - Anke Badenhorst
  Yeah, I think there is a question on the customer base. I can double check.

1:06:32 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  There shouldn't be. There used to be when I was running through the questions individually. I feel like we put that in the business characteristics questionnaire.  Check what the answers were there. David, if you're looking for specific clients, because some clients don't want to deal with currency or international customers or whatever.  So in which case, if you find something and it's like, you know, it would be  perfect for Jenny. and she said no on international customers this is where I would say like have Luke or Ryan do a temp check.  They're like hey Jenny found an amazing business it's in Canada but it is a digital business so you can like use SBA to buy it and bring it here but their customers are Canadian like you know would you be open to hearing about it and you temp check before you go through all the work of doing a write-up to see if you can get her to be like yeah I'd love to look at that you know.

1:07:29 - David R
  Okay perfect.

1:07:33 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So yeah on to check the questionnaire and make sure that we are still asking that if not we might need to do another update.  We are asking that perfect there you go so if they have a yes then you know you can pursue it if it's a no then I would still temp check it because it might just be like selling them on the possibility.  Hey you can do SBA like they speak English it's only upstairs you know. Oh, hey.

1:08:04 - David R
  So correct. would be that we'll be kind of also for UK or Australia. Good question.
  ACTION ITEM: Compile questions for SBA lender re: Canadian tax returns, performance notes - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/272936516?timestamp=4092.9999

1:08:14 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Anka, I want us to bring in an SBA lender and ask a bunch of questions, particularly about performance notes.  And this is another. I was actually thinking of inviting Jared or Nicholas from Huntington. To ask these kinds of questions too.  So he said we have a program for Canadian tax returns. I'm assuming it's just Canada. But again, what do we do with assumptions?  We validate them. So let's get that question off. So Anka, can you just grab. These thoughts. other thing around performance notes is can you attach a performance note to.  Them just achieving the exact same thing that they did in a previous year, like no incentive otherwise. is above that.  Like, is that allowable? If we don't have the spike in the previous years, can we attach a performance note to them at least achieving the previous year's performance?  Ryan was going to ask this, but he didn't get a chance before he left.

1:09:18 - Anke Badenhorst
  Okay.

1:09:21 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Good. This is good stuff. How are we feeling? I came down a little bit, but I know you all can absolutely take it.  And these are just areas of improvement because we need some closes y'all. We really do because I'm going to be forced to put more pressure on you by taking on more clients without hiring more people because we can't do it unless we get some clients off our books and get the revenue in that way.  So not to put my pressure on you, but this is, again, and everything is not just me harping on you.  There's a reason behind it and I like you having the context. So that it makes it easier and understand why better communication across all the channels with clients and knowing what's going on and being reactive to their concerns means that we don't lose them before they get under a law and just like get off the books right so like that it's there's a wider piece than this is one of my curses but also my gifts is I can see 5 million steps ahead and so that's where my brain goes right she's leaving she's not gonna get under a law like we're not gonna get ours like let's be fit it hasn't happened yet but that's that's that's how my brain works so any questions how y'all feeling great you're good okay savor that win sp submit an bunch of clients are submitting on y's in the next couple days so this is gonna be like  raining in a little eyes which is  awesome because that means you guys are putting good deals in front of them you saw what's happening yeah nice work y'all okay i know it's way thank you i'll see you all for various meetings tomorrow uh aunt is going to put together for the handover for ryan so anything that's happened in your world that you think is relevant for him let's drop it in this document so that he has a really awesome landing he can take 30 minutes and scan everything and be back on the ground and doing everything he needs to do rather than spending all monday trying to get up to speed with what's happening without me being available to tell him yeah so that's cool don't we all want that one more vacation like it's like i feel good for everybody if we do this yeah that would be amazing yeah yeah yeah cool all right i'm getting lunatic Athena now because it's end of the day my brain stopped working so thank you you all later  I appreciate you. I'm feeling really good this week is like started out a little rough for me. I'll be honest, but I'm feeling very energized and excited and I think we're all working really well together along me that continue.

1:12:14 - Anke Badenhorst
  Yep. Yep.

1:12:16 - Luke Gillespie
  Thanks.

1:12:17 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Thanks y'all. Did I cover all your stuff? Anything else you want to talk about?

1:12:20 - Luke Gillespie
  Sorry, I just like kind of ended it without checking in. Yeah, we've got everything. We're good. Good. Cool. right.  Have a good day. Good night. Thanks. right. Thank you guys. Bye.
