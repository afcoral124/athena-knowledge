# AcquiMatch Buyers Club 08/14/2025

[00:00:00] 

**Athena:** Hey Gil. Hello. How's it going? Good. Hi Polly.

Hello. Nice to see you. How are you? You, I'm great. Hey, Steve. Hey, Michael. Nice to see you all. Uh, I think we got a few more that are joining. Um, in the meantime, I will start, uh, kicking off today's session, which I am super excited about. Um, I have known Eric since, gosh, like very early in my search journey.

He is a local to me here in Austin, um, and has been, um, a really amazing, like warm, supportive energy when I was asking a lot of questions. And then we started realizing that we both shared a love for businesses and entrepreneurship. I was a lecturer at the university, so Eric does a whole ton [00:01:00] of mentorship and amazing stuff, um, locally with businesses and everything as well.

In addition to that is a veritable resource of. So much good information and experience around both business valuations and wealth management. So we've actually got a part two that we're gonna be doing on September 4th for Buyers Club, which is wealth management for new business owners. But today is gonna be all about valuations and he's brought Tom, who is the chief business appraiser over at their company.

So I'm gonna hand over to the two of you. Two. Um, we're so excited to have you have this conversation today. We are gonna get. So much great information about business valuations. I got to preview the slides and I'm super excited for this conversation. So thank you so much for being here. Please, uh, do a quick intro on yourselves, if you don't mind.

**Eric:** Sure, sure. Uh, well thank you. First of all, I don't know if I can live up to that wonderful, uh, [00:02:00] intro that you made, uh, for us, but, uh, no, it's been a real pleasure to get to know you and, and, uh, you know, and I, I, as we were talking here recently and kind of sharing your, your vision for, you know, what you're trying to do with, uh, with Acqui Match.

I think it's, it, it, it has a perfect place in the, in the ecosystem for business acquisition as we know that there's gonna be trillions of dollars of wealth transfer. You know, over the coming years because of demographics, you know, because of, you know, because of a lot of reasons. And, uh, you know, I think, you know, just by way of background, you can see in my, my background here that, uh, I'm CEO and founder of Voice and Associates Wealth Consulting.

And we started the valuation practice, uh, because we were working with a lot of business owners and, and frankly, a lot of owners that had sold their businesses and they hadn't achieved their goals. And, uh, they were, you know, kind of left, you know, kind of like wondering in, in some sorts, you know? What could have been.

And they, [00:03:00] they, so, so we, I took a totally different view on wealth management and said, well, okay, well, how can we address without being Accenture, KPMG or some type of management consultant, how can we address the, the value of the enterprise, which is the, the most important asset that, uh, that I think probably a lot of you, uh, either have already or are going to have, uh, and how do we address that value and address anchors to that value while you're still in the business?

So you at, at some point down the road, you can achieve a better exit. And so that was really the genesis, uh, of this. And, and like I said, I've known, uh, Tom for, you know, 22, 23 years, and, um, Tom is, uh, uh, he's a, uh, I'll let him, uh, mention his credentials, but, you know, we'll, we'll cover that in the presentation, but.

Uh, he's a credentialed, uh, business appraiser. Uh, we do certified business, uh, uh, appraisals. And he's my, uh, chief of, uh, appraiser. So, um, you know, my background is investments and financial [00:04:00] planning, but primarily investments. Uh, and I've, I've worked with a lot of high net worth individuals. I've worked with a lot of business owners, which, uh, to me, and, you know, I guess this will save some time in the presentation, but, uh, you know, over the years and through a pandemic or two, uh, you know, have seen some of the, I think some of the pitfalls that, you know, that people live and they get stuck in the moment and they get stuck in the day to day that they kind of lose sight of, you know, the big picture and the long-term planning and things like that.

And so, uh, I've made it a, a real personal, I think, crusade of sorts to, to try to help, uh, educate or at least just bring light to, you know, some of the things that I know can add value to an enterprise and, and, uh. So that's hopefully what we can achieve here today. And uh, and I know that there's, uh, just, you know, just as an aside, I think Athena alluded to.

Um, alluded to this, but in some of the areas that we'll maybe just like barely [00:05:00] hit on today that we won't get real deep into or kind of like the, the characteristics of the high performing and we can do a whole, uh, high performing enterprises. We've got a whole, um, uh, presentation on that and then contingency planning, and then who's on your team.

And, uh, the other things that I don't have in this particular presentation today, but kind of a deeper dive on perceptions of small business and then, uh, effective entity structure, which obviously we could schedule more time to do that, but I'll let comment. I love it. 

**Athena:** More topics for buyer club. Um, just real quick housekeeping before you get started, Eric, for everyone here.

Um, we are recording this session so you will have access to the replay and the notes and Eric and his team's details. And also if you have questions, please write 'em down. We're gonna have time at the end to ask Eric all of the questions. So, um, but we'll let him get through the presentation first before we dive in with questions today.

So, um, Eric, sorry, without further ado, I won't interrupt you. No, 

**Eric:** that's all right. I [00:06:00] was just gonna let Tom introduce himself just very briefly and then, uh, and then we'll go ahead and jump into it. 

**Tom:** Good afternoon and, uh, thanks for having us at Athena. Um, actually Eric and I have worked, uh, at three businesses together, although we weren't aware of each other at the same time.

We both were working for Bank of America in Dallas in the nineties, and that was where I first started doing business valuations. I was, um, in the trust department and we had to satisfy what's called Reg T, which was to value. Uh, not publicly traded, uh, financial instruments that were held in trust accounts so that you could have an accuracy in feeing.

And, um, rollercoaster brought me to Austin. Eric and I started working together for another wealth manager. Um, mostly, uh, that's, that was publicly traded, uh, securities. And then many years later, uh, we [00:07:00] decided to get together and I started doing business valuations with Eric in 2019. And so I, along the way, I earned the CFA credential, chartered financial Analyst, and then, uh, more recently earned the CVA, which is a certified valuation analyst issued by nfa, which is specifically for business valuations.

And I, I looked it up. Uh, I consider. The CVA to be the premier credential. There is an a SA, uh, there are a couple of other credentials that have kind of either been purchased by NFA and are no longer active. Uh, but there are, uh, as of last year, there are forty six hundred and thirty three of us. So there's not that many to give you a, uh, top quality business valuation.

**Eric:** Well, thank you Tom. That's, [00:08:00] that, that brings me up to date. Yeah. Well, uh, Athena, thanks again very much, um, and really appreciate this opportunity. This is great to be with all of you and. Again, we'll kind of go through the presentation and I'm sure along the way you'll have some questions and uh, you can save all the hard ones for Tom.

Uh, I'll take all the easy ones. Uh, no, I'm just kidding. Um, but, you know, we'll be glad to set aside some time and I'll have, uh, at the end there'll be, uh, kind of our contact information if we could be a further resource to you. But, um, today, I think what, uh, Thena and I talked about doing, first of all, you can all see my screen right.

Okay, perfect. Uh, is we wanted to talk about the fundamentals of business valuation, and so there's lots of different components to that. So we'll kind of cover those and then, uh, we will kind of dig in a little bit to what we call the five pillars of value, uh, and kind of go through each one. And some will seem rather intuitive to you and some may not seem, uh, terribly intuitive.

But, uh, we'll go ahead and, uh, start with the [00:09:00] presentation. If I can get my, hold on. If I can get my. There we go. Working now. Okay. We'll make the lawyers happy with this slide. Um, so let's start with, uh, some, just some basic data on small business. I thought this would be a good backdrop because small business really does, you know, drive this country and, you know, there's a lot of companies that make the headlines, but it really is small business and particularly in this kind of two to $10 million range that really.

Kind of drive our economy. And, you know, and obviously in, in my other hat that I wear, which is on the wealth management side, I'm kind of a closet economist and spend a lot of time in the data. And, and we know that, you know, I, and I put some, some of these statistics here, we got 33 million small businesses and we know how important it is to the inco, to the economy that, um, that, uh, small business creates a lot of jobs.

In fact, a lot more jobs than the large companies do, and small business, uh, employees and essentially half of the private sector [00:10:00] workforce. And so I think as we go along, you'll see, you know, with the backdrop of what I said earlier about all of this wealth transfer that's on the horizon, that it's gonna be very important to have accurate or reasonable, uh, and relevant valuations for enterprises.

And not just for the transfer of that wealth, but also as you as like, you know, uh, aspiring bi new business owners. Uh, and growing your, your wealth, uh, and, and growing the, the enterprise. And, and I think that to me, I think if you walk away with anything today, it's, it is not just, you know, we're not just here to talk about, have a, get a valuation when you sell it, uh, down the road, but also using valuations and using a third party to help maybe benchmark your, your progress.

And you'll hear that a couple of times, uh, here, uh, today. So, uh, just a quick note on, you know, kind of the, the pitfalls. And we see this a lot, uh, that the failure rate for small businesses is unfortunately very high. And you can see that two thirds [00:11:00] of businesses, and this really relates more to kind of, um, you know, startup businesses and the failure rate is exceptionally high when you get out to five in particular.

10 years. And so, you know, I have yearned to understand, okay, why is that? And a lot of it is, again, living in the moment and not doing planning, not doing budgeting, forecasting, contingency planning, which, uh, you'll hear more about here later on. And these will all tie back into what are your, you know, what are your anchors to value, you know, there, there are a lot of, uh, you know, drivers of value that you, uh, may be more obvious, maybe more intuitive, uh, that you'll celebrate.

But then, you know, I wanted you to leave today with kind of a thought of what, what are the anchors, potential anchors to value that as I transition into becoming an owner of a business that I should be paying attention to. So, uh, hopefully, uh, you'll take some of that away. Uh, but. Um, a quick note and that I think this, this is all something that was laid bare [00:12:00] during the pandemic.

Uh, you know, I had the opportunity as part of, uh, uh, you know, the, the city of Cedar Park up here in our, um, in, in our, uh, chamber of Commerce to do pandemic assistance grants to companies that have applied for PPP. And I knew some of this already, but honestly it was really laid bare that people aren't doing, uh, contingency planning.

They're certainly not looking at transition planning down the road, which I know is not really a topic for today's conversation. But, uh, you know, when you, you're doing a contingency planning, uh, you're doing, uh, risk analysis, uh, you know, even if you're doing it oftentimes. You know, uh, business owners aren't sharing it with key staff.

And so, uh, you know, there's a lot of risk that builds up. And, you know, a lot of people, frankly, don't do budgeting. We see that a lot in, in our valuation work. And you can see the statistics here are very compelling. Uh, and, you know, when you think about these things, I mean, obviously no one can plan for a pandemic.

Uh, it's very [00:13:00] hard to do that. But there are clearly things that we'll talk about, uh, as we get through the presentation that, um, that, that, uh, you should be aware of and should be thinking kind of in, in a 360 degree. Realm about, and as we get down towards the, you know, the, the bottom bullets here, I just say that, you know, there's a lot to this that pertains to you as the owner.

And when you think about this, the owner, and this is one of the key pillars of value, is the, the owner psychology. Is that the, the, what's going on with the owner from their own personal side or their own personal risk control or planning or whatnot that has it, it has a, a tremendous bearing on the value, uh, of the, uh, of the enterprise.

And so you can see here that a lot of owners don't have a will and they haven't really started planning. And there's, you know, there's not, you know, they don't have buy sell insurance, they don't have key person insurance. Uh, you know, they're not thinking about risk like they should. And, and that can [00:14:00] create a potential existential risk to the overall enterprise.

So I thought, you know, we take some time and just go through the fundamentals of business valuation. So apologies to any of you out there that, you know, kind of have been maybe been through or, uh, know somebody that's been through a valuation. But, you know, we'll just kind of hit on these and kind of, uh, you know, obviously take questions at the end.

But I want to, you know, just I hopefully that we will dispel some of these myths. Uh, and I think the intrusive part of this is, is something that we hear, you know, a lot that, you know, you're, you know, you have to be not vulnerable to extent, but you have to be open and you have to share data that's important to evaluator in terms of, you know, contingencies and, and and whatnot.

And, you know, a lot of business owners, you know, when we do our work, we've got to recast a lot of the financials 'cause there's a lot of personal expenses that are being run through. And, you know, I think a lot of people, you know, [00:15:00] uh, feel a little untoward perhaps towards that. But, you know, I think these are myths.

It doesn't have to be expensive, you know, when you think about it in terms of it being an investment in the ability for you to track and, and measure your growth. Uh, time consuming certainly doesn't have to be. And then, like I said, intrusive. Uh, it, it is, you know, it, it, you know, it, it, it's a standardized process and, uh, you know, we don't want any more information than we need to, to do our work.

So, uh, there are a lot of reasons why business valuations are, are needed and done, and I put in italics here, the ones that we probably, you know, see more often than not, I'd say at the top, clearly transactions, uh, whether it's a full sale, it's a partner buy in, partner buyout financing. I know a lot of you and I I talked to Athena that you know about SBA, uh, uh, valuation or SBA loan valuations and, and the, the triggers at which that becomes a necessary thing.

Uh, so we [00:16:00] certainly do that. We work with a lot of banks, uh, litigation, uh, and, uh, it's unfortunate, but we, we do see like business and personal divorce situations and, um, uh, not so much on the, maybe the fraud side, but we've seen some, uh, pretty uncanny financials. I'll just leave it at that. But, uh, but litigation is another reason why we get called in, uh, to do, to do that.

And finally, down on the. You can see here some of these other ones, intellectual property is quite nuanced, uh, in terms of, uh, the skill required to value, uh, ip. Uh, but down at the bottom, you, you see, you know, some things that kind of pertain more towards, you know, business growth and future growth. And also from a personal standpoint, what you'll hear me talk about time and time again, it's really important, you know, from a planning standpoint.

And one of the reasons, you know, why it was important to me to do valuation was we spent a lot of time working with people that had sold [00:17:00] businesses, like I said, that didn't accomplish their goal. And, uh, and you know, a lot of people that come to us and say, well, I've got a business that accounts for a big chunk of my net worth, but I think, you know, it's worth, you know, $5 million, but I don't really know why.

And, you know, you think about like, you know, the quality of information in drives the quality of information out. And so if you're planning your own. Retirement your own exit down again, down the road. 'cause I know most of you are just getting involved, 

**Athena:** just 

**Eric:** getting started. But you know, as you, as you go down the road, I think it's gonna be increasingly important for you to know what that value is because it helps you in your own personal planning.

Uh, and then, like I said, for benchmarking business growth and, and so on and so forth. What a, a third party valuation really does at its most basic level. It is, is it takes the emotion out of it again. It it is, it is. There are standards that are applied, uh, and, you know, it's unbiased. I mean, we don't have any.[00:18:00] 

You know, dog and the hunt, so to speak. Uh, you know, uh, you know, we're looking at it from a very objective point of view, uh, and we're not only providing a number, a, a lot of appraisers will just provide you a number and a report and say, have a nice day. I think because we started our valuation practice, it was born out of wealth management and working with owners that, you know, we tend to be a lot more consultative and trying to provide you feedback regarding what you should be celebrating and also what you should be perhaps working on to help drive your value up.

Uh, you get a lot of peer group analysis, kind of like understand where you, where you sit within your particular industry group. And, uh, so there's a lot of data that we look at there, uh, and then, um, obviously as a, uh, uh, as a planning tool and maybe exit planning is not the right word here, but, uh, but certainly a planning tool to kind of, you know, get a unbiased opinion as to maybe the quality.

Some [00:19:00] quality elements related to your operations, uh, and if you identify some of these anchors to value that it provides things that you can work on in your business. Uh, so, uh, and then I'll just leave, leave it at that, and then Tom hit on this earlier, but, uh, it's important to have, you know, some rigor in the process.

And again, standards of practice. Uh, and this is, you know, the CVA and the CFA are, but, you know, just two of, of several key credentials. Uh, yeah. I would also argue with Tom that the CVA is certainly one of the more important ones. Uh, but NFA here is Tom mentioned, is our sanctioning body. Uh, and then they oversee, uh, the uniform standards.

Uh, but, uh, again, it's the, the rigor that it, that it's applied to, um, uh, to valuations there. Now, there are a lot of people out there. That will, you know, advertise, give me, you know, five pieces of data and I'll give you a number. Well, that's not a, that's not a valuation, and it's certainly not a certified, [00:20:00] uh, valuation.

Uh, as you'll see, as we talk about the different levels of reports that you know, that there is a, a very, you know, deep and systemic or systematic approach that, uh, that certified appraisers will use in valuing, uh, a business. So we'll talk about each of these, uh, in, in isolation, uh, briefly, but there are really three approaches to, to value.

And, uh, and you know, there individually relevant, uh, and again, depending on the nature of the industry, some of these are more relevant than others. And, um, you know, but, uh, I'd say that most of these are fairly intuitive and some report levels will only focus on one and some report levels that are more comprehensive.

We'll look at all three. So we'll start with the income approach. And so this really, when you think about income, the income approach, think about like, you know, financials and, and the analysis of, of trends and, and analysis of, [00:21:00] of the data that is knowable. And so, uh, and you think about past and, and, and projected future profitability.

I mean, we'll. Uh, we'll look at, you know, whatever, you know, budgets or proformas are, are available. You know, that's not knowable data yet. So we will focus on what is known in the, in the, you know, in the history of the business. And, and so we'll use that, uh, um, within the income approach. We'll use all that data.

To derive some of these boldfaced, uh, things like sell seller's discretionary earnings and, you know, and EBITDA and, and, you know, we'll use those as kind of, um, the fulcrum points on which we can calculate values. And so in any one particular project that we do, you know, encompassing all three, all three approaches, I mean, you could have like, you know, anywhere between like three or four and like 10 or 12 different individual calculations of value.

And then what we [00:22:00] do was, uh, as appraisers will go in and, and weight those as, as, as to how important we feel that they, that they are in helping to really tell the story of value. But, uh, the income approach, you know, if you have, you know, e even if you're not, you know, like completely linear on your operations, but if you, it tends to work best if you have profitable, um.

Uh, profitable business with, uh, you know, a strong track record, uh, and, and very, uh, strong financials, uh, and, uh, you know, a consistent business model. Uh. So the market approach is probably what you would, uh, think, uh, what you would think. I mean, it's looking at comparable transactions. Uh, the real art in the market approach from an appraiser's point of view is determining which comps, uh, are most relevant.

And, you know, when you think about the different screens that you would have, I mean, you know, or geographically are they relevant? Are they relevant? [00:23:00] You know, in size to my. Particular company? Are they relevant in, you know, um, uh, in, in location? And, you know, it, it oftentimes we find projects, uh, certain projects where, you know, you say like dental practices as an example where there's a lot of comparable transactions, uh, to draw from.

And so it's, it's really easy to kind of drill down to a comp set. But then there are others, you know, that have more nuanced business models that are a, a lot, a lot more challenging. 'cause we really, in many respects aren't comparables, uh, to speak of. But we'll look at the industry codes, uh, and we will do our best to try to come up with, uh, with comparable, uh, comparable transactions to, uh, to, to judge our, uh, opinions on.

And then the asset or the cost approach really speaks more to the balance sheet. You know, it's looking at net assets and, um, there's elements within this particular approach that require kind of a, a [00:24:00] nuanced capability. Like if you're, you know, say like if you have inventory, you know, your business that carries inventory or has, you know, a, a high degree of asset intensity, uh, you know, and, um, that, uh, that you have a lot of pro property, uh, plant and equipment, uh, that, you know, I mean, we don't do specific equipment appraisal.

There are people that will do that. There are, there are people that will come in and value inventory, um, you know, per se. So there, there's, within this sleeve, there's some specialization here, but, uh, again, it's just looking at net assets and, and coming up with a, with a value based on that. Uh, so the premise of value, um, I know it's a lot of like kind of word soup on this page, but it really goes to what ci under what circumstances are, are we doing this valuation?

And, you know, more often than not, it's going to be based on the presumption that it's a going [00:25:00] concern. Uh, you know, there are cases where you know that there's existential risk to the enterprise, and so we have to look at it through maybe a slightly different lens. And then, you know, liquidation comes in the form of, you know, like when you talk about turnarounds and things like that.

But more often than not, we're going to, uh, establish a, the going concern as a premise of value and a as a, uh, premise under which we are going to, uh, construct our valuation thesis. Talk about, you know, snapshot versus conclusion of value. Um, you know, snapshot, if you think about, like, just think about it this way.

I mean, a snapshot is like, you know, putting numbers through, uh, a hose and into a system, and then you're analyzing the numbers and then you're providing an output of value based on those numbers. So it's very quantitative and a snapshot, and by its nature is. Less intensive, uh, less comprehensive, [00:26:00] uh, and certainly less costly, uh, than a conclusion would be.

Um, and you see here that snapshot will use, you know, one of those three approaches to value, whereas a conclusion is inherently much more qu, qualitative and quantitative. And it will look at all three of those. And so, you know, there is a range again, uh, of, of, of project intensity, uh, that is, um, you know, that, that you could look at.

Now, um, like I said, snapshot is a limited scope valuation. Um, and again, the conclusion really is more of an opinion of value. And this is where the, I think the skill of the appraiser comes into play because they're going to analyze. You know, business model, your competitive moat, um, they're gonna analyze, you know, maybe the the regional economy, which, you know, within which you're operating.

And, um, uh, and, and it, it, it's gonna provide a much deeper analysis. And [00:27:00] so snapshot is good for, you know, if you're benchmarking progress to your strategic plan. Uh, it's, it's good if you have a relatively small enterprise, uh, and it's good, you know, good for that benchmarking, which we were, we wouldn't, we've been talking about now a conclusion in any instance where you're dealing with like, uh, call it a, a partner buy-in or a, an investor buy-in, and there's a legal contract that, that codifies that transaction that could be subject to dispute in a court of law, or if there's anything that could fall under scrutiny by the IRS, uh, you want to have that robustness that's provided within that conclusion of value.

Information that we need is fairly straightforward. You know, just basically years of financials, uh, internal financials, uh, tax returns to the extent that they're possible. You know, this is not anything that you haven't, I guess in your own individual journeys, haven't, [00:28:00] uh, you know, haven't, uh, yet or have, have already come across in terms of your due diligence.

But in an interim financial statements, like say for now, sitting here in August, we would certainly. Want to have some interim financials from through through June if we were doing a, a, a project with a, with a current valuation date. And then, as I said before, we'll take whatever data is offered to us, you know, in the way of forecast budgets, strategic plans.

Most people don't have that data, uh, against the, the soft data that you see down below, um, is, um, fairly, you know, can be fairly detailed, but obviously when you're looking at, you know, compensation relative to the industry group or turnover of employees and, you know, what types of benefits are being offered versus the competitive landscape, you know, there's, and, and honestly contingent liabilities and or contingent, you know, assets, um, are, are all, all very helpful for us to know.

[00:29:00] But, uh, it's clear that, you know, in a lot of cases we don't, we just don't have access to that 'cause it's, you know, either not available or, uh, not being provided to us. So I wanna talk about value drivers and anchors, and then we'll kind of like finish up with the five pillars. So we'll talk about first the internal value drivers, and these are the things that you can control.

And you see this, this list here. And you know, I, I'll tell you from a, a evaluator's perspective, and Tom would tell you this too, that, you know, the number one thing that you can, you know, con control here is the integrity of the financial statements. And, uh, you know, I mean, when we were doing pandemic assistance to smaller businesses, their, their businesses over $2 million, that when we asked them to provide financial statements, they took a cell phone photo of the front page of their bank statement and, and called it their financial statement.

And so, you know, it goes to, you know, what type of platform are you using? Are you using, you know, a [00:30:00] bookkeeper QuickBooks, you know, so and so forth. You can control, you know, kind of like your financial condition. Uh, certainly the, the culture and you know, again, the soft things. Employee satisfaction, stability or things that, that you can address as a business owner, uh, a lot of times we see either a key customer risk or a key person risk, like somebody you can't afford to lose.

And you're not necessarily looking at locking that person down through some type of a competitive package or through some type of incentive, uh, pack, uh, incentive program to advance their growth. Um, and then, um, you know, you can see down here, you know, product service strengths. I mean, obviously you control your product or service.

And then the owner, uh, the management risk, uh, that we'll talk about a little bit, uh, as it relates to culture, uh, and, um, so on. So the things now that you can't control, you know, we can't set tax policy. Uh, obviously we're not in [00:31:00] charge of setting short-term interest rates. Uh, and you know, these were just, you know, economic, macro, cyclical drivers that we have to, uh, that we have to, you know, at least recognize exist, uh, particularly economic cyclicality.

And we have have to prepare. You know, accordingly, uh, you know, position within the industry lifecycle. I mean, if you're not like, you know, 360 degree aware of your, your operating environment, like, think of Blockbuster video. I mean, that was a, uh, that was a terrific, you know, terrifically valued company until it wasn't.

And it was made, you know, obsolete very, very quickly because of the industry lifecycle, uh, turning, uh, on a, on a dime. And so, uh, market share and position, I guess you, you could argue that maybe you, you, you could, you know, influence that, but obviously you can't control, uh, competitors that enter your market space.

I mean, that's up to them. You can react to it. [00:32:00] Um, but, uh, again, you, um, you know, you can't control, you know, who's gonna compete against you. It's how you react to it that's most important. So, just some additional factors. I, I think this is, this in itself is pretty intuitive. Uh, you know, a lot of people have.

Uh, you know, in intangible assets that don't really even know it. Uh, and I've used the, the dental practice or the architectural practice, uh, that you have a lot of, you know, intellectual capital, maybe some, some goodwill, but your customer base, a lot of people don't realize that a, a a, a very stable, uh, revenue producing customer base has, has a lot of value.

And uh, you know, unfortunately we've heard some service business professionals that say, well, when I'm ready to hang it up, I'll just close the business. Well, there's value potentially that you're leaving on the table there because it does have. It does have value, and in some cases if you have kind of a unique process that that has value too.

[00:33:00] Um, you know, I was talking to somebody, uh, a good friend of mine just earlier this week whose father is, uh, in his eighties now, and he runs a food distribution business in, in Chicago, and, uh, has recipes that have been handed down through generations. And there, there's a contract, uh, somebody that, uh, works with them that does contract production of, of barbecue sauces.

Uh, and, uh, you know, uh, she didn't realize that that had some, some intrinsic value to it. And so again, you know, value comes in a lot of different ways and that's just one obviously fast growing, uh, businesses, uh, tend to be higher value, uh, higher, uh, more highly valued, I should say. Uh, and then, uh, than the other two.

Location and financial health are pretty intuitive and we've kind of covered that a little bit. So let's talk about the five pillars of value. Uh, and then we'll close with some, maybe a, maybe a call to action for you as [00:34:00] you enter your journey of business ownership. And then we will certainly have time for questions.

But, so these are the five pillars. Uh, and this is a byproduct of talking to a lot of business owners. Uh, you know, people have sold businesses, people have brokered businesses, people that have advised businesses. Uh, and you know, the top three, you know, probably are very intuitive. The bottom two are are fuzzy, right?

Uh, and then, uh, you know, I'll emphasize when we get down to owner readiness or owner psychology, just how important it is for businesses that are under, uh, $10 million. But we'll take each of these individually. So when you think about sales, I mean really sales is the, the mother's milk of everything.

That is a company. You can't pay salaries, uh, you can't pay rent. You don't have profits unless you have sales. And so when we're looking at companies and we're doing that deep dive, you know, we wanna understand, you know, what is, obviously, what does that [00:35:00] competitive landscape look like? And where is the company and the industry, what, how do they differentiate themselves, uh, from the competition and, you know, what do they articulate as their value proposition, right?

And then do they have a strategy with regard to sales? Do they use a CRM? Uh, do they have a, do they have a tracking mechanism? Are they accountable? Do they have KPIs, key performance indicators that they're looking at? And, you know, and, and you know, as I said down here, metrics and dashboard assessment, are they actually assessing that?

You know, and we, we encounter a lot of clients that have sales concentration and they rely on, you know, maybe two or three clients. And that's great. It's easy. Doesn't require necessarily a lot of work. But you know, what happens if one of those goes away? And, you know, you think about the risk on your own.

You know, looking at looking in the mirror and assessing your own business risk, you know, [00:36:00] it, it's almost impossible to look at what are the contingent existential risks that exist with some of your customers too, right? That, that could go away in an instant. And where does that leave you? So, uh, differentiating yourself and also having a strategy to expand the, the, uh, your, your customer base.

Diversify your customer base is really super, uh, important to the ability to help drive value. Next, we have financial controls. Again, it's, I, I'd say time and time again, it's just like we see so many, so many instances where, you know, the financial controls are lacking or there's like a discrepancy that is hard to reconcile between what's being reported on tax.

For tax purposes and what's being reported on the, uh, you know, the internal financials. And as I've already kind of alluded to, there's a lot of people that really don't think about accounting policies and, you know, they, they don't [00:37:00] have internal controls and. And a lot of people, you know, while they may use QuickBooks for sales, they may, you know, they tell us that they keep all their expenses on a spreadsheet, and then they send both of them up to their CPA and the CPA has to forensically put all that stuff together.

Uh, and, uh, you know, but, but there are a lot of business owners that, you know, have a real, um, I call like a, a visceral attachment to the business model, but they don't have a background in finance or accounting. And so this kind of speaks a little bit to like who you should have on your team. Uh, and, uh, you know, the financial controls, uh, is something that it's, it's probably from an appraiser standpoint, one of the most easily identifiable, uh, anchors to value if, if you don't have it.

And it's not to say that you've gotta be using QuickBooks. To have value, but it's just like how you approach this whole financial function. Uh, that's, that's really, really [00:38:00] important. And a lot of people aren't really, you know, certainly if you're not running good internal financial, uh, data, then you're not able to analyze that data in a sta and identify trends.

And again, it's like we go back to the pandemic, it was. Uh, pandemic's a pretty obtuse example, but you know, oftentimes, you know, you will go down that rabbit trail if you're not analyzing financial metrics. Over time, it's easy to get lost in things that are, you know, like the kind of like the, the, the rotting apple that's sitting in the basket, and then you don't see it because you're not analyzing the data and all of a sudden you get to a point where it's, it may be existential and you've gotta deal with it in the moment.

But, you know, again, if you're looking at financial ratios and metrics on an active basis, you can look at and you can identify trends, uh, that may be adverse, that you can address operations, uh, is, um, I'd [00:39:00] say in, in over the last 20 years that, you know, operations, you, you, you can like bifurcate this into kind of the core operations side as well as.

The human capital side and operations, depending on your industry, you know, if you're manufacturing a widget, you know, obviously supply chain and how you source product, that's gonna be important. You know, your price modeling and you know, and an analysis of your direct input costs. I mean, that's all gonna be very important for that.

If you're a service business, you know, it's gonna be different obviously. But you know, within the last 20 years, we've seen contingent liabilities. Tied to the HR function, just thinking about, you know, the, uh, the potential liability risk related to me too, and harassment in the workplace and things like that.

And if you're a two to $10 million business, uh, you know, you can be, we used to use this term in the banking business, uh, you, you're as strong as your weakest link. And if you're not, you know, if [00:40:00] you're not, uh, using handbooks, if you don't have an approach to employee engagement or, uh, you know, doing job satisfaction analysis, you know, oftentimes you're either gonna get yourself in trouble, you're gonna have higher turnover, which means you've gotta go to market and then hire new people and then train them, which.

Obviously very costly. Um, but you know, the, the key thing here is to, to avoid that kind of, uh, turnover. And so when we look at this through a evaluator's lens, obviously we, we wanna see from an operational standpoint that people have taken these areas seriously. Uh, and, uh, that there, there are in fact, um, you know, uh, you know, processes in place to kind of address the, at least the monitoring of all these.

Then the last two, again, as I said, are a little bit fuzzier, right? It's, I mean, it's, you know, people would, a lot of people that do valuation work say, well, there's no way I can quantify that. But, [00:41:00] you know, I think it, it is observable, you know, if you're going and doing a deep dive, and this is just really kind of rhetorical feedback to all of you.

But, uh, really try to spend the, the, the time, the quality time too. Understand the dynamic of your, uh, of your leadership team. And again, it's gonna be important, you know, who are you gonna have on your team? And it goes, it includes like a, you know, stuff like DISC and Myers-Briggs and stuff like that. But it goes beyond that.

It's like, how do you work together as a team? And if you don't have that cohesion, if you don't have that collaboration, uh, it does, it, it it can very well impact your value. And clearly as it relates to like talent retaining key talent, um, you know, that's, that's something that, you know, a lot of owners don't realize is important until it.

Literally on top of 'em. Uh, and then, you know, how do you communicate your vision down to your employees? And like, for instance, [00:42:00] I run a company that has 10 people, and I, I hope that all of 'em could, you know, you know, at least minimally articulate, you know, what my vision is and, uh, and what my value, uh, set is.

And so I try to do, uh, a lot of communication. I try to communicate very well what that is, so that everyone is rowing in the same direction. And that's what this, this, this whole area really pertains to is, is, uh, you know, that cohesion, communication, collaboration. Uh, and we find that this is very, very strong with high performing, uh, uh, companies that, that have high value.

And the last but not least is, uh, I know I'm talking to a bunch of, you know, aspiring owners. Here, but I'm really talking about you. And when you get past 10 million, you know, 20, 30, 40 million, then you have a board of directors. You have, you know, you [00:43:00] have an enhanced hierarchical system, right? That, that doesn't depend as much on you, but when you're at the two to $2 million level, it depends a lot on you.

And, and I can tell you prime of facie evidence here as speaking as a business owner, um, you know, you and you inherently we're all human and, and it's easy to internalize stress. Uh, and oftentimes, you know, you try to internalize it, but it it, you wear it on, you wind up wearing it on your sleeve. And so if the owner has anxieties, if the owner has.

Not only anxieties with the business, but from a personal standpoint too, it's often very apparent to not only your employees, but you know, you may not even realize it, but it may be apparent to your clients too. Uh, and, uh, so addressing that, whether it's your own personal finances or if it's other personal things, uh, your own personal risk control, uh, so on and so forth.

But, [00:44:00] um, but, uh, and, and also stressors in the workplace. And this also goes, speaks to like who is on your team and who. Uh, and I've been accused of this and, and I've, I've looked at my, I, I've looked myself in the mirror and, and I've recognized that there are things that I need to let go of that, uh, that serve as a stressor for me.

And, uh, and I need to let go of it and have somebody else do it or bring in somebody to do it. And, you know, that's what this owner psychology owner readiness piece is, is, um, it, it really speaks to, to you and your kind of like your mental, mental wellbeing, I should say. So, uh, the last two slides, and we'll open it up, is just, you know, are you leaving value on the table?

And, and I know a lot of you are just jumping into this for the first time, but you know, this is something that you can kind of look at, you know, over time and just say, you know, am I doing goals and visioning? And it may sound [00:45:00] kind of cliche, well, yeah, well, I should do, I should vision, I should set goals.

But, you know, I mean, being intentful about it, and even if it means like, uh, going down to the beach for a few days and staring at the ocean and, and just kind of closing your eyes and say, well, what do I want this business to be? You know, that part's pretty important. Uh, and it can lead to some really good idea creation.

Uh, and if you're, you know, like you're looking at staff, looking at your competitive situation, you're addressing your financial statement, uh, you know, your, the quality of those statements and then. You're addressing risk, uh, whether it's on your side personally, or risk within the business, uh, that, uh, you know, again, unfortunately, a lot of people don't address risk until the risk surfaces.

And then you can't, then you don't have time to deal with it. You're just having to triage whatever you can. Uh, and then doing contingency planning. And then the last thing here [00:46:00] is. Tax planning. Uh, and you know, there's a lot of wonderful CPAs out there, and unfortunately, a relatively small subset of those will take the time to say, you know, here are the things that you should be expensing.

You know, here are the, here is, you know, maybe a, a, a better structure for you. You know, uh, and here are maybe ways that you can structure things to avail yourself to tax credits and things like that. Uh, and having that tax planning is gonna be pretty important because you may not realize it, but you may very well be leaving some value on the table there.

And then finally really just a call to action. Uh, and this is a, in many, in many cases, just a regurgitation of that last slide. But I kind of leave this, uh, as, uh, I leave this in a slide deck because, uh, you know, it's one through eight, it's, you know, kind of easy to kind of look at. And I've had some people like actually print this off and kind of put it up on the inside of [00:47:00] their door to kind of remind them, uh, of things.

And, and again, you don't have to tackle all of these, you know, in an instant. But, you know, I think over time, you know, we, we can't sit here and guarantee, well, your enterprise is gonna increase, you know, 35% in value if you address all these things. But I can tell you by and large that your value will increase if you execute on these things.

Um, because I can tell you that a lot of people, uh, don't. And then the last one, again, just to reemphasize this point, focus on you, the owner, uh, and just make, make sure that you don't forget. 'cause it's so easy to get, uh, oh. You know, really ensconced in the business, and I know all of you are very excited to become first time business owners, but it's easy to get immersed in that.

And then you wind up not taking care of you, uh, on, on, you know, either health front or financial front or so on and so forth. And [00:48:00] so, again, a big reason why we do what we do is to try to make sure that people understand that. So, uh, with that, I think, uh, I've come to the end of the formal presentation.

There's our contact information, uh, up there, uh, with a QR that I think, uh, should take you to to our website. But, um, uh, I guess, uh, Athena, uh, ready to take some questions if there, if there are questions. 

**Athena:** Yeah, I got, I got. Lots of points and questions, but folks, as you're listening, um, feel free to, you know, put your hands up if you have any questions too.

Um, EDA, do you mind getting the screen so we can see each other there? Yeah. And Eric, we'll share all your contact, contact information also with everyone afterwards. I'm happy to, 

**Eric:** I'm happy to send you the presentation. You can send it. Well, yeah, 

**Athena:** like, if you don't mind us sharing it, that would be awesome.

Oh, 

**Eric:** absolutely. 

**Athena:** So that was amazing. I was like riveted the whole time, so thank you for that. I, I wanna actually pull [00:49:00] out the last point because I have never heard, and like I know it from helping businesses and my own business and like the owner psychology and like how detrimental that is and, and in my consulting days like to a business's success.

So I was really happy to hear you actually talk about that as a pillar of, of value, right? So, um, I'm really curious to hear. How has the owner's anxiety or personal stress or, you know, their psychology actually like decreased value? How often are you seeing that as the case in these smaller two to 10 businesses?

**Tom:** Well, I'm not sure I see it at all. Um, if I could jump in, um, that's what what we typically see more often is there's a, an owner that's being pushed by family, maybe, um, [00:50:00] kids spouse to, you know, you're already old enough, it's time for you to go and they really don't want to go. Uh, that's probably the most common thing.

And sometimes they convince themselves they want to go and then they go through the, uh, beginning of the process and they realize they don't really want to go. 

**Athena:** Yeah. 

**Tom:** So I haven't seen anybody have so much anxiety that it. Reduce the value of their business. 

**Eric:** Yeah. Well, I, I think what that really speaks to is like owners that maybe are not engaged as, as much, you know, because they've been doing it so long and they're tired and we, I mean we have seen, seen that.

Um,

**Athena:** so, um, we, we actually just had this happen and one of our clients, that owner changed their mind even though they were like 85 years old. Right. So like, just gripping onto it. So it seems to be, especially with um, uh, the generation that's now [00:51:00] selling and looking at retirement, that kind of part of their identity is being a business owner.

So what's like, Tom, to your point, are you seeing like quite a few owners aren't actually ready, not willing to hand it over and being pushed by someone else? Or what would you say is the skew to Absolutely ready? Take it away from me. I'm not, I don't want to, my family's forcing me to kind of situation.

**Tom:** I'd say, um, there's some people that want to sell and get out. I think it's far more likely that they're feeling pressure to begin the process of selling and getting a valuation, and they don't really want to do it. And that's, that's, um, you know, and, and, and they find out through the process how much they like doing what they do, or they can't imagine doing anything else.

So that's far more likely to happen. And, and I guess, uh, just, I, I understand our audience here is people that [00:52:00] are thinking of buying businesses and not actual business owners. So I would say for anybody who's thinking of buying a business, that's probably the one thing you would wanna focus on is, you know, and probably be upfront, like, do you really want to sell this business?

Are, are you doing this because your wife wants you to, your kids are wanting you to, or do you want to. 

**Athena:** Yeah. Um, 'cause it's a lot more And are you ready? Yeah, exactly. It's, it's very costly and frustrating if you go down the line of due diligence as a buyer. You've done qv, you've, you know, gotten the SVA lined up and then, and then owner pulls out.

So, um, so for folks, you know, most of the folks listening would be, you know, thinking future owner, but also when I'm looking at all these businesses, what I'm looking for in the business. So you're saying owner readiness is number one to dig into from the buy side? 

**Tom:** Yeah, I would, um, we, and, and we'll see [00:53:00] that right away.

I mean, um, and it was kind of, uh, just instructive for us. Like, you know, the process is usually, you know, we, we, we paper up the, the engagement, um, and then people would drag their feet getting us the financials. Um, they wouldn't respond. Um, you know, and it's. It's kind of like they know if they do that, then the process is gonna move forward.

And so they kind of sabotage themselves by, even though they've, they've paid for the engagement, they may just say, you know what, I wanna slow play this. Um, you know, and oh, I gotta wait till my taxes are done, or this or that. So you get an idea that that's going on right from the get go, and it happens a lot more than you would think, uh, just coming in from the outside.

**Athena:** Interesting. I'm, I'm not surprised to hear that at all. Um, I'm also curious, when we talk about the financial [00:54:00] controls on these smaller businesses, what percentage of the businesses would you say, like, don't have good things in place? And follow up question to that? Does, does it, does it. Does not having the financials in a good place or not having those kind of tight controls equal bad business, or is there some nuance in between that?

**Tom:** I'm gonna add, you know, I was thinking about this, um, especially during the five pillars, and it's kind of an esoteric answer, but, um, there's a lot of business owners and, and, and I'll just think of, uh, animals running with the herd. Um, it, it we're typically valuing going concerns a business that is profitable.

So, and, and, and most people that are looking to buy businesses are looking to buy businesses that are profitable. Now, most of the, a lot of those businesses that owner can, can't necessarily articulate the five [00:55:00] pillars. He can't, you know, he's instinctively doing it. He's running with a herd, he's creating these things and he's doing it by.

Uh, feel. Um, so they may not have great financials, but they're doing okay. Uh, once, once you get them, uh, or force them to get somebody to make them for them so that I can analyze them, you know, you'll see that. So, um, then it becomes kind of a situation when you have a a, a going concern pretty much everybody running in that herd and that the, the herd that's running is the going concerns, the, the ones that are getting eaten or, or the, the liquidation situations.

So then it's a question of, of as to, well, are they better than median? Are they below median? And that, that becomes kind of the nuance that I have to try to, to get to, uh, because I think I. You know, if, if you [00:56:00] try to describe how to ride a bike, you could, you know, basically put a manual together that would have a hundred pages in it.

But a lot of these guys just do it instinctively. And so, um, they've got a, a, a business that's, that's profitable. Um, they couldn't necessarily tell you why the bike is balanced, but it's going. And so then it's just up to me to kind of look at the industry from a couple different angles and say, well, you're doing okay.

You're doing about the median, or you're knocking it out, you're top quartile or you're, you know, bottom quartile. So that's kind of, uh, the, maybe not the answer you were expecting. 

**Athena:** No, I, that's it. Well, so we, we come across. All sorts when we're looking at businesses as a buyer in terms of where their financials are at, and for a lot of people that are used to coming from, you know, places maybe that had audited financials that they've got, you know, a PE background [00:57:00] or something like that, that scares them.

That, that the small business does not have those, that level of financials. Mm-hmm. You know, I am a small business owner and I know how much time it takes to, and I know the right way to do it. Right. And it's still like a massive lift for us to make sure that we're doing everything that we're supposed to be doing.

Uh, I don't think a lot of owners think about that when they're running the business. So I guess it's a, you know, it does not mean run if you're looking at a business and it doesn't have, you know, super tight financials or, and it sounds like maybe the answer is somewhere in the, well, you gotta look at all the other things then to kinda 

**Eric:** Yeah.

I, I, I think so. I mean, I, I think it's. You know, I mean, there, there are certainly instances where we come across like anomalies in the financials, and Tom and I will, you know, kind of talk about it and say, well, this doesn't really make sense, and you can build some conjectures as to why it is. But, uh, again, you know, that's just, and, and a lot of times you can flat out explain things that, [00:58:00] uh, you know, you know, after you dig in and do the analysis.

Like Tom said, the owner's not doing it. So, but somebody's coming in forensically like, like us and doing, trying to ascertain value and we're doing it. But, um, but a lot of times you can explain it and sometimes it has to do with kind of personal, you know, personal, um, you know, it may be expenses or things that are being run through the business or whatnot.

But, um, you know, there, there are times where you run into, again, you're not dealing with a lot of audited, uh, well. You're not, you're dealing in a lot of instances where it's just self prepared stuff and it's being handed to a CPA and the CPA is, you know, kind of spitting out a tax return. But, um, uh, but you know, every once in a while you run into something that, you know, these line items just don't, there's something here that doesn't sync up.

**Athena:** Mm-hmm. Right. I would say though 

**Tom:** that, um, I've seen a lot of squirrely internal financials, um, and [00:59:00] people literally don't know how to use QuickBooks or they don't use it correctly. Yeah. Um, but, uh, I, you know, if you've got tax returns and the tax returns are now, it, it's a red flag for me. If I see three years worth of tax returns and there's a different preparer each year.

Hmm. Um, 'cause that could be a problem. But if you've got a, you know, a, a tax return that's prepared by a CPA, um, that's, you know, I mean, I. That's what a lot of business brokers are gonna go by anyway. Um, they're gonna assume that your internal financials are not to be believed. So, um, I would say that, you know, I would run now I had a case where, you know, there was a guy, he was selling his business and he was doing his own taxes, and this was something that was going through an SBA situation and there was a lot of hair on that, and I noted that in my [01:00:00] report.

Um, there was a lot of things that didn't make sense. So, um, but for the most part, if you've got, if you've got tax returns, I like to look at both, you know, I do like to see if the tax returns are kind of, sort of very close to the. Uh, internal financials, uh, 'cause a lot of times the internal financials will give you nuance that the tax returns just don't have the detail.

But if there's a lot of space between 'em, you know, I'll just rely on the tax returns. But, um, I would say that at least you want that level of competency with tax returns to be comfortable with the numbers on the business. 

**Athena:** That's interesting what you said about three different preparers. Why, why is that a potential red flag or something to dig into?

**Tom:** Uh, that just goes back to my public company days. Uh, you know, if you're, if you're getting fired by your accountant or he is like, you know, I really don't like what I'm doing here. [01:01:00] Maybe you don't like the number that the, the client didn't like the number and he, he goes to somebody else and then somebody else.

And, you know, maybe you don't see, you know, maybe tax services instead of CPA. Um. You know, it's, it's a red flag anytime you, you switch around a lot. Um, 

**Athena:** interesting. I, I've not heard that before, um, but I can totally understand that. So it's an interesting one to, to check out when you get the tax returns.

Like who's, who's preparing 'em? Is it the same person? Are they A CPA, which they have different regulations as a tax preparer than somebody that's just a, you know, preparing taxes, right? 

**Tom:** Yeah. There's a remarkable lack of, uh, professional integrity required to be a tax preparer. Right. Um, you know, that's, uh, crazy.

I don't know why people would, you know, I mean, I used to have my, my chainsaw repaired by a guy who lived in a mobile home and, um, it was [01:02:00] kind of a scary place to go because you're going there to get your lawnmower or your chainsaw repaired. But, um, there's a CPA business being run out of the, the, you know, the mobile home next door and.

You know, I don't know anybody who would feel comfortable like taking their business and their personal stuff to somebody in that setting. Not saying that there's anything wrong with that, but you gotta just kind of make a value judgment as to. 

**Athena:** Yeah. Who's advising you? Who's advising them? Um, I'm curious, Eric, with your, um, blockbuster example.

We're, we're in a time now that the hot topic all the time is. Artificial intelligence, what's the risk to that? So how much is that factoring into your valuations now? I'm sure it comes up a lot, right? Like, what's the potential disruption by this technology? Is it something to even pay attention to? Is it not coming up in [01:03:00] valuations?

What's, what's the conversation around AI with y'all right now? 

**Eric:** I, I think you just threw the grenade in the room. Uh, yeah, because I mean, there's, it is evolving at such a rapid clip. I mean, it might be an enhancement to value. I mean, it, you know, if the, there's expectation that you could enhance your productivity and reduce your staffing cost to some extent, or maybe your contracted staffing costs.

I mean, it, it, it could be very helpful. But, you know, you just can't say, oh, well, you utilize AI and that automatically justifies a 10% premium. I mean, you gotta understand what it's being used for. And a lot of people say. I use, I use ai. Well, what does that mean? Well, I, you know, when I'm writing letters to my clients, I use gr, you know, to help craft the letter.

Well, that's not, that's not ai. And, and I, I'd say just from a kind of a macro analysis standpoint, there's a lot of kind of like visioning and innovation now, but, uh, I think as it relates to two to $10 million companies, it, [01:04:00] it, it's, you know, we're still in the, like, the first inning of it being actually incorporated into core business practices, I think.

And so I think your question has, has a lot of validity today, but I think it's gonna be, become intrinsically much more, uh, important and impactful. You know, as we look at companies like three and four, five years down the road. 

**Athena:** Well, especially companies that might be be disrupted by it too. Sorry Tom. Go ahead.

But like, are they using it and are they gonna be made redundant by it? 

**Eric:** And some, some are. Yeah. Some are, some are early adopters that have jumped into it. Two feet. Tom, go ahead. 

**Tom:** I have two examples. One, one yay. One a, uh, both kind of, so school photography business that's in trouble from ai, um, because of, for a lot of different reasons, um, the image generation.

Um, and so that, that business model is, is getting, uh, [01:05:00] is, is getting pressure by ai. Mm-hmm. Uh, specific. Uh, another valuation that I'm doing right now is an ad, a small advertising agency. Um, and this was fascinating because I. This guy has, uh, a lot of clients that emphasize the family nature of their businesses that they're creating commercials.

And when I say commercials, I'm, you know, an old guy. Uh, these are spots it would appear on anything from TikTok to Insta and what have you. And he was like, you know, the business wants to have children to appeal to the family motif of their business. So we use AI to generate the kids because it's really problematic to have pictures of real kids online.

Like, you know, parents don't even wanna, um, sign off on it. So right. In kind of the same thing, I mean, you know, [01:06:00] school photography on the one hand and advertising on the other, they're using images. Yet there's two different outcomes on value. One's, one's using it to increase, and the other, it's a threat to.

**Athena:** Interesting. I am, I'm, we're all like, when, when we have our, our client meetings and internal meetings, we're talking about it a lot. We're, we're using it, uh, ourselves, we're building it into our business to, to enhance the human service that we give and remove some of the things that humans don't necessarily need to do.

Um, okay, so here's a fun topic, because this comes up all the time. We see businesses and they're like, the business is valued at this much plus 10 million of inventory. So how, when you were talking about the asset cost approach, where, you know, a going concern, working capital inventory, like it's, I know it's a very layered conversation, but from a buyer's perspective, when they see a broker saying, oh, [01:07:00] it's valued at this much, plus this much in inventory.

What's, what's someone to make of that from a valuation perspective? What should we bear in mind as buyers when we're looking at a business's value and the inventory slash working capital conversation? 

**Tom:** Um, I, you know, I, I use, uh, there's a couple different ways to normalize working capital. You know, I use the Bardo method, uh, but which is a, you know, fancy way of saying you, you kind of move it in with, you know, and look at it over time.

But, um, the asset side of the approach is not really that relevant to most businesses, particularly service businesses. Um, I've never really, I mean, you know, if you get into a, like maybe a restaurant situation, um, but even then, you know, the stuff's pretty cheap. You know, you're arguing [01:08:00] about plates and tables and stuff.

Um. I haven't run into too many businesses where there's, there's a lot of inventory that even a business broker would have to break that out as a separate item. Like, well, here's X and then you gotta pay this pre, that doesn't make any sense. I don't know who would say that, but, um, I, I, we see it all the 

**Athena:** time.

Really. Well, yeah. Yeah. 

**Eric:** Well, I mean, it, it could be like from the service business, it could be just like backlog. You know, they're, they're saying, well, here's, here's a pipeline of new activity. And I, and I've seen that personally with some clients that, you know, had been, you know, you know, they, they were trying to make an offer and the, and the seller was trying to argue that, uh, that they needed to fund that.

Pay a premium for that backlog or whatever, and that could vaporize tomorrow. And obviously that has some, you know, cyclical exposure and, you know, we all know that, you know, things could change rather quickly and that, that backlog could, could evaporate. But yeah, [01:09:00] I agree with Tom. It's, you know, it's, uh, you know, I mean there, there's, like I said, it, the, the, the whole notion of like inventory and equipment appraisal is pretty nuanced.

And I'd say, you know, that's probably Tom, when you say more relevant, like when you're in a, you know, operating under a liquidation premise of value where you're just, you're valuing assets necessarily, or you have like a, a turnaround situation, which again, we don't do, you know, too many turnaround situations, but you know, where you've got, um, you know, kind of some kind of existential threat out there and you're like, okay, what's, you know, what, what could you sell these large assets for?

But again, you know, I'd say more often than not, we're doing service businesses and you know, that's Goodwill. Basically. That's your intangible asset. 

**Tom:** I've done a lot of, I mean, I'm thinking of like agricultural businesses, um, construction with a lot of equipment. But even then the, the value of the business and, and, [01:10:00] and the FFE goes with the business.

So, um, you know, all those bulldozers and what have you, that if they're generating income and, and if you've got a going concerned business, it's the, the machinery is gonna be earning more than it's worth. That's why you have it. So, um, if it's not earning more than it's worth, and the business is probably in trouble.

So, you know, I, I really don't just, I, I don't see it even in, you know, in cases where you've got construction, where you've got really a lot of equipment because it's. 

**Athena:** So I'd love to try to like, uh, break this down. 'cause a lot of these folks, you know, well, all of 'em are first time buyers, right? The brokers putting out like what they think the value is and they're getting very, like, whoa, they're saying the business is worth this much, but then the, there's all this like, inventory on top of it that they're saying needs to be paid for separately.

So let me give you a couple examples. Um, one that I, I looked at myself [01:11:00] where they weren't saying the inventory was separate, but they were saying that, oh, it was an event rental equipment business, and they had $17 million worth of inventory. And I went down and looked at the business and it was like a $17 million garage sale.

I'm like, there's no way they're using all of this, right? So they're saying that that's the value of it, but they were including that as part of the purchase price in other instances that we've seen recently, like something where. Um, it's a like car membership rental situation where the gen revenue is generated by people using the vehicles, but they're saying the business is worth this much and also all of these vehicles are gonna be a separate value.

Or in another instance where it's like a, um, company where they. Or a distributor of, of products, right? So they've got [01:12:00] all this inventory, which is gonna be valued separate from the business that they, they actually sell to customers. So hopefully that gives you some, some ideas of what we're seeing. But I guess for people looking at these businesses, like what, what, what do you mean by going concern?

And that, you know, the value includes the inventory just for them to try to wrap their heads around how you are looking at value with inventory and whether it should be part of the value or separate. Does that help explain that? Yeah, it does. Well, you, you've trying to get a basic explanation here. 'cause we we're, we see it a lot, you know, brokers, there's no standardization with brokers and what they chose, asking.

Price, all that. That's, 

**Tom:** yeah. Well let, let's look at the event rental business, which is the first one you mentioned. Um, to me that's a question in nomenclature. So they call it inventory, which is technically working capital, but if, if your business is [01:13:00] renting tables and chairs and things like that, you can't call that inventory.

That's the FFE, I mean, that is what you're buying. So that's, that's what gener, that is your long-term, you know, fixed plant and equipment that, that you are using to generate income from. So for somebody to call that inventory, you know, that's, that's, that's really kind of, uh, not kind of, it's, it's just wrong.

So, uh, at distributor business, again, you gotta kind of look at like, okay, um, is the guy selling the business because he is not doing that well and he is not doing that well because he is got a lot of non-performing inventory that he just wants to unload as part of the deal. Um, you know, that's where you've gotta kind of look at, well, you know, here's, here's some guidelines on what this industry typically has, what kind of industry turn ratios there are.

Um, and, and you know, if you're, [01:14:00] if you're buying a warehouse with a lot of cobweb stuff in it, um, you know, you just, you know, that's, that's not something you should pay for either. So, you know, you gotta kind of kick the tires a little bit, um, physically look at it, you know, that's not something that will typically do in a business valuation, but I would highlight it in a report and say, look, you know, you're, this business is carrying twice as much inventory as a typical business in this space, and as a result, its turns are, maybe they're not even half as fast.

Maybe they're a third as fast. So he's got more inventory, and yet it's turning even slower than it would. Well, and you, you start to wonder about the health of the business. 

**Eric:** Yeah. And actually, I mean, that could have a, a, a, you know, looking at it through a different lens, it could have an adverse impact because, you know, in that case you probably, you're looking at negative working capital, right?

And so that's gonna take away value at the [01:15:00] very moment that you've got the seller that's trying to insist that it's, you should be adding value. And, you know, and that's just a, you know, you're buying an existing business and some of 'em are gonna be run real well, and some of 'em are not. You know, and he may argue, well, I had a great deal and I could buy this surplus inventory.

But like Tom said, if it's growing cobwebs and all it is is a drag on your working capital and, you know, honestly that probably, you know, merits more of a discount than, than a premium. 

**Athena:** Okay. Can you, I can never bring up enough conversations about working capital. So can you explain your point really quick on negative working capital and what, what that might look like or what it means for like, like a buyer, someone looking at the business?

**Eric:** Well, I mean, you know, Tom said that we look at a lot of data. There's a lot of comparable sets that, you know, we can ascertain. Like what, for your industry group, you know, what's a, what's an average, you know, uh, you know, receivable collection period and you know, inventory turns and working capital metrics.

And, um, and then you can kind of derive from that, like what [01:16:00] level of inventory would be, you know, would be steady state to run the business the way you know that it's being run. And then you can kind of, you know, from that determine like what kind of excess, you know, working capital, what, what is not?

Does Tom use, you know, that term non-performing, what is non-performing working capital? And by the same token, you look at, you know, your collections, you know your aging schedule and things like that. And you can see like. You know, or you're extending such generous terms to your clients that you're not able to, to turn your sales.

Right. And so, you know, it's just, honestly, this, it, it is like financial management 1 0 1. I mean, you know, obviously the, the long-term assets including goodwill, you know, a well performing business is gonna have a bunch of goodwill, but that's kind of a little bit more esoteric. But in a transaction, goodwill, uh, is very, you know, ha has very discern, well, it has very important value, right?

But, but the working capital, I think [01:17:00] maybe Tom jump in here, like, you know, has the, has the chance of, you know, really adding or subtracting to, to value how it's managed. And it's not, but a lot of people just say, well, I've got plenty of cash in the bank. Right. Well, that's, it's a very, you know, very, you know.

Single plain way of looking at it. Uh, 'cause working capital, you know, maybe what I was talking about earlier about kind of like that, that apple in the basket that's rotting over time. You don't really notice it. I'm talking about working capital in many respects because, you know, if you're, you know, these types of things kind of like rot at the mine, if you're not paying attention to it, and then that, then it, you realize, you wake up one day and you realize it's a huge problem.

And then you've gotta go get a emergency line of credit or something to, to fix that. And that's why, like monitoring that and understanding also what are the, the ratios for your industry, what, what makes sense. You know? And, and a lot of people [01:18:00] aren't kind of doing that kind of analysis to understand what, you know, they, they're just kind of, as Tom said, they're just, they're just feeling it.

They're just going, Hey, everything's great. So why, how do I need to, you know, why do I need to care? You know, I wanna, I wanna work, you know, four days a week and I want to go to the ranch on the weekends or something. So 

**Tom:** what I'd add to that is, uh, let's look at the definition of working capital. It's current assets minus current liabilities.

If you have negative, that means your current liabilities are less than your current assets. And usually that's bad. Now, you know, I was on a number, I, I mean Michael Dell and Dell computer at the turn of the century. They used to brag about having negative working capital. 'cause they were, they were all about just in time.

And so it, if you, if you can get by with a very low amount of working capital, then you don't have that cash tied up in working capital. So, you know what [01:19:00] I see most often, I mean, you know, obviously you want a one-to-one, um, which is, you know, equal. Um, a lot of businesses will carry two to one. You know, for me, with a lot of small businesses, especially with the way that nowadays they can have a bank relationship where if they're the sole owner, they're parking their cash in the bank and they're earning a pretty good return on CDs or money market or what have you.

And so technically they're working capital might be 10 to one. Well, you know, obviously that's over, you know, and that the, the, the owner's gonna take most of that out. But, um, I don't, you know, I mean, low, a a, a working capital ratio that's low is not necessarily a negative if they're managing it well, and, and that was the thing that Dell used to do.

They would brag about how they were, [01:20:00] you know, even, you know, dragging out through the time that they were building computers. Uh, this is when they were still making 'em in the United States. But, um, they, they were, they were all about like, Hey, you know, we, we don't want our, our money tied up in working capital.

And, uh, the CFO would come on every quarter and talk about, you know, how they managed to ring another couple hundred million dollars outta working capital. So, um, inherently it's not a bad thing, but. You have to just look at the, you have to look at the way the business is being run, and if they're paying all their bills, um, you know, that's, that's, um, it, it, it's not a problem.

**Eric:** Yeah. And this is a good time to kind of introduce this whole concept that, uh, again, we don't see a lot of these, although, and you, you can run this report in QuickBooks, but cash flow statements, right. I mean, because, you know, you can make adjustments and you can do, you know, you could be [01:21:00] creative on the income statement and in many cases on the balance sheet too.

But you can't, you can't, you know. You know, fool. Cash, right? I mean, cash is cash and right. So if you're just intuitively we're talking about working capital. I mean, that's, you know, you know, cash flow from operations, right? So you're gonna have, you know, if you're increasing your inventory, right, uh, you know, that's a use of cash.

But if you're extending out your, you know, your, your liabilities, I mean, that's a source of cash. And so I think to, to emphasize and amplify Tom's point, if you're able to, you know, manage free cash flow, right? And, and think about it that way, as opposed to just like net income, which most people do, right?

If you look at it from a cash flow perspective, uh, then, uh, then that, that's the true measure of, of how, how well you're, you're functioning as a, as an operator. 

**Athena:** Yeah. Um, good stuff. I'm, I'm, yeah, I'm obsessed with cash flow. That's the statement I [01:22:00] spend the most time in as a business owner's cash flow forecast.

Right. You run outta cash, you can't run your business. Exactly. Um, but, and so two, two, a two part question. I I hope the first part's easy. Could you just give a like 10th grader definition of goodwill, and then could you talk about the difference between a business valuation and quality of earnings and, and where the line might be between the two or why you might want one or the other or both?

As a business buyer, 

**Tom:** well, the goodwill question's pretty easy. Um, and SBA documentation requires it. So, um, you know, we'll do the, you know, the, the valuation from a market approach, income approach, asset approach. Let's say I come up with the value of the business being $2 million. And then you look at the balance sheet and the hard assets that are tangible on the balance [01:23:00] sheet are 800,000.

So Goodwill's 1.2 million. So it's just the difference between the value of the business and the tangible assets. So, um, the second question was a little more esoteric and I'd get, need you to repeat Quality of earnings. 

**Athena:** Yeah, quality. Like if you were to just like simply define the difference between valuation and quality of earnings, and then maybe why, why you might want one the other or 

**Tom:** both.

Well, quality of earnings is actually, that's a more detailed report than valuation because you're starting to get forensic and there you're, you're looking to see if there's any chicanery going on. Um, you know, are you declaring that you're earning more than you actually are? And, um, you know, that's, [01:24:00] that's, that's much more detailed.

Um, you know, I have to, I have to confess, we would love to do a quality of earnings engagement. We never have, but that would be one of the pricier things that we would do. Um, because it would be not only evaluation, but then you're really kind of coming at it from a forensic standpoint of. Um, I, you know, and, and I'll just, I'll just roll back on a, on the, the, the structure of a business valuation is that it is essentially a, it's, it's a report that details what a hypothetical buyer would pay to a hypothetical seller.

And that's it. That's, that's, that meets the industry standard in a quality of earnings thing. You're, you're coming up with a value. But then, and, uh, just back to the, the, so we will say we've [01:25:00] accepted these financial statements from these sources, and this is what we are using and we're not an auditor and we're not expressing any opinion on those financial statements, quality of earnings.

You are expressing an opinion, uh, and, and you're expressing a very pointed opinion. And so it's a much deeper dive than even a a, a conclusion of value business valuation. 

**Athena:** Good. Yeah, I wanted to make sure. So we always recommend clients to definitely get a QE like as part of their due diligence process because it is different from the valuation, which in, in their instance it will usually come up because the SBA needs it in order to do an SBA loan.

They're required to get a business valuation is where, um, you know, a lot of your experiences if you're not just working directly with maybe the, the broker or the seller themselves. Um, so, um, I know we're at time. This has been so fascinating and so [01:26:00] fun. So you can tell kind of nerd I am that I'm like, I love this stuff so much.

So thank you so much. This was ton of value, ton of really great insight. Um, so we are gonna have you back to talk about the next piece of this is as a business owner, like how are you doing that planning and wealth management? Um, side of things, how are you thinking about things like the, you know, 4 0 1 Ks and those sorts of things that, that make up, like managing actually the, the, the wealth that you are.

Um, but also like risk planning, I think too, it sounds like around that. So give us a little preview of what we might expect to I'm butchering the description, but 

**Eric:** No, I think, I think that's, I think that's good. Well, I mean, uh, you know, I think we've touched on a lot of the, the points. You know, I think you, you, you learn from experience and you realize.

You know, after the fact, you know, people sell and they, oh gosh, you know, I would've, coulda should've, you know, and I think that that's really the bottom line. And a lot of it is just like contingency planning and 

**Athena:** mm-hmm. [01:27:00] 

**Eric:** And, and the hr, the human capital function is so important. And, you know, I mean, you have to be competitive.

I mean, uh, you know, I'm sit on our local city council and I mean, we're, we're talking about having to do, you know, Sal salary benchmarking, you know, like in half the time that we were used to doing it, just because the market is moving fairly rapidly. And the, you know, the, the labor, uh, you know, labor markets are, are still pretty tight despite what you may see on CNBC.

But, um, but yeah, I mean, I, I think it's just going through the various. You know, as aspects of the, you know, uh, of the owner making sure, I mean, if you have multiple owners, uh, that you're, you know, you're protected if something happens to, you know, as I kind of put my, my, I I, you know, I'm not a lawyer and I don't play one on tv, but I do oftentimes think like one, it's like, well, what are the circumstances that could arise?

You know, in that like, like that, that range of outcomes, and you've got that fat tail occurrence, it's like a [01:28:00] low probability of happening, but if it happens, it's gonna be extremely costly. And how do you, how do you guard against that? And, you know, sometimes you just need to have a, an advocate or somebody that's writing side saddle to you that, you know, as you're jumping in and you're thinking about, I need to sell this widget.

All right, well I need to manufacture this widget here and I need to ship it here, and I need to make sure that I account for it, and then I've gotta pay my people. Well, you know, that's, that's very encompassing. And so oftentimes they're just not. Stepping back and thinking about, okay, well what if I hit, you know, hit the bus or somebody else hits the bus.

Right. You gotta protect your people. You gotta protect yourself. And I, I'd say that's just, you know, probably the, in, in a nutshell, what, what we're gonna try to 

**Tom:** accomplish. 

**Athena:** Amazing. I, 

**Tom:** I had one, one point I I forgot to make, if, if I might, um, and I, is your, is your audience, is it mostly Austin centric? 

**Athena:** No, we're all over the us.[01:29:00] 

**Tom:** Oh, okay. All right. Because Austin is hot and it's been hot for 40 years and I talked to a lot of people that wanna buy in, in Austin and they want to pay, like, you know, maybe a, a multiple that might be effective in Cleveland. And I'm like, no, you know. There, there, there are regional premiums. Yes. And so to the, to the extent that you're, you're in, in a, a place like Austin, uh, that has grown, you know, Austin over 40 years has grown at essentially twice the rate of the rest of the country in terms of its economy.

So you, you gonna, you're gonna have to pay a premium and to get into a market like that. 

**Athena:** No, you're, you're so right. And actually we, we have a limit on, you know, certain markets in terms of how many clients it will take on 'cause they are such hot search market. So Austin being one of those where I'm just like, it's a 12 month wait list at minimum [01:30:00] right now.

Um, so yeah, the, the, you know, I think there's probably a part two for us on, on this side of things too. Like when we can get under the hood a little bit on nuances of value, if you guys are up for it. I've really enjoyed this and it's such. Good information for us to think about as we're, you know, uh, and, and for, you know, all of our clients here as we're looking at businesses.

So, um, Eric, I'd love to, and, and Tom, like we can brainstorm maybe some part twos to value, like these things, these nuances, regional hotspots, uh, industry trends, what the business buying craze on the internet is doing, the valuations, all of those sorts of things. If you're up for it, maybe we can do yet another conversation after the wealth management.

**Eric:** Absolutely. Well, sure. Um, I think you could spend a lot of time just on the, you know, if you could get owners, like once all these folks are in the saddles and, you know, running their businesses, I mean, going through the strategic planning process and, and kind of understanding how do you [01:31:00] utilize valuations to accomplish or to, to measure that progress, to say, you know, here's year one, here's year three, here's our gr I mean, you could actually quantify, you know, the success of those.

Uh, of the implementation of those plans. So, um, love it. And then lots of good stuff 

**Athena:** for us to dig into. Um, but thank you so much for all of your time, insight, wisdom done, really awesome stuff. We'll share your details, um, slides and the recording with everybody that wasn't able to make it live today. Um, and then put a note in your calendar, everybody for September 4th, so we can do that wealth management contingency planning conversation as well.

Um, Tom, Eric, thank you so, so much. This has been awesome. 

**Eric:** Our pleasure. Thank you. Thank you. Pleasure meeting you. It's good. Thank all of you. 

**Athena:** Take care. We'll see you soon. 

**Eric:** Alright, thanks. Alright, 

**Athena:** bye 

bye. Bye.
