# AcquiMatch Buyers Club 03/04/2025

[00:00:00] 



**Athena:** Hello. Hello. Welcome. Welcome. Thank you. How's it going? Amazing. Cool. Um, looks like we have some folks trickling in at random times throughout the meeting. So this is fun because we get to deep dive on a few things. So, um, guilt team was telling me that you recently had a burger call on a business that you're interested in.

Do you want to. So listen on how that went and what the next steps are. Maybe give us a little context on what the deal is that you're looking at too. 

**Gil:** I can do all of those things. Um, yeah, so it is a IT consulting firm out in Arizona that, uh, deals with, uh, clearly IT. Bill, I'm so 

**Athena:** sorry. I, I, it's, I'm having a hard time hearing you.

Is there any way to get closer to the microphone? 

**Gil:** I was having a hard time. Yeah, that's probably better. 

**Athena:** Yeah, it sounds a little bit better, [00:01:00] but go ahead. 

**Gil:** I 

**Athena:** can hear you. 

**Gil:** Okay, IT consulting firm out of Arizona. Um, they do IT project management consulting, which is basically what I've been doing my entire career.

Um, had a broker call. Um, broker was not very forthcoming with a lot of information. He took it from the car. Um, and to make a long story short, because it is a longer story than this. Uh, we. I, I, I supplied him with proof of funds. I supplied him with the pre approval letter from the SBA. Uh, I supplied him with my resume.

And finally, about an hour ago, he sent me an invite for a meeting with the sellers on Thursday. Amazing. Cool. That's, that's happening on Thursday, uh, afternoon. After, after this call, actually at 6 p. m., uh, Eastern. Um, and we'll see. I'll, I have a whole list of questions I want to ask the sellers.

Specifically about their numbers, uh, and how they got to [00:02:00] those numbers because they had almost doubled their ST in 24. Um, I want to ask them about, uh, how much hours they actually work because there's, it's two owners. And according to the broker, they work 45 hours, uh, both of them together. So I want to get down to the details of that, uh, and a few other things.

So, got a one hour call with them on Thursday. 

**Athena:** Okay, cool. Um, I'm sure Ryan will go over strategy with you. Do you know how competitive this one is? Like, are there other buyers circling? 

**Gil:** Uh, according to the, according to, to the broker, there is a lot of interest. I don't know what that means, uh, specifically, uh, obviously they don't have any other LOIs or anything or anything like that in place.

Otherwise he wouldn't be talking to me. Um, and, uh, it's brand new. So it's been in the market for maybe three weeks. That's about it. So, they're still asking for top dollar. They're also, that's another thing. They're asking for top dollar. They're asking for over a 4. 5 [00:03:00] multiple. Um, it's 4. 5, 4. 52 actually. So, we want to see, I want to see what's actually going to justify that multiple.

Do they have anything in place that can actually justify that? 

**Athena:** Yeah, um, on, on the first seller call, If if there's not other offers and, like, you can check with the broker, like, just before, like, hey, are there other, like, active offers? Um, and typically what I like to do on that 1st broker call is, like, hey, I'd love to set up a call with your sellers on the 1st call.

It's just kind of like, I get to know you. Like, I'm not going to dive deep. I just want to get to know them and get a sense of them. Um, those things that you're seeing are valid. You might just want to string it along to, like, conversation number 2 to go deep on some of those, like, specific details, um, because these sellers oftentimes do not look at their financials the same way that we do.

And it can be [00:04:00] really overwhelming to be, you know, getting on the phone with buyers and then grilling them on on things that, you know, it's just like, I don't know. We just had a really good year, you know, and like, we did these things and that sort of thing. So, um, those questions that you have, uh, make sure you get a strategy call in with Ryan before, because there's ways to ask questions about those things without it being like, Okay.

So why did your SDE double like they probably don't even know what SDE means, you know what I mean? But like hey, I noticed 24 seemed like a record year. Like did you guys do something different? You know, so like just remember we're building rapport We want to like treat them like people You know the things that like Renan and Nash did about just like building that rapport showing them that they cared about them as people and You know, Nash moved really quick, but he's still like, talk to him about golf and turned up with the golf balls and that sort of thing.

So, um, just making sure you're kind of building in the report building before you get into some of those [00:05:00] deeper questions. Or if you feel like you have time, I really like. Having that be meaning number two on market. We obviously have to do this simultaneously. We have to move quick and build rapport. Um, but you know, as long as they're not adding back both owner salaries and the SCE and they've done a salary adjustment for owner number two, um, then that's something that.

You know, can be overcome by hiring and like, getting a sense of like, so how do you guys split your roles? Like, what's your day to day look like, you know, so you can ask questions without being like, you know, going hard at them, them making like, rather than just just general curiosity. So, like, hey, both of you are in the day to day, like, how do you guys.

Split up what you do, you know, like how do you decide who does what, you know, and ask it in your own way. You don't need to necessarily do it like Athena does, but I'm giving you the general flavor of how you want to go in there and like, Hey, you guys had a record year in 24. Like, did you do anything differently?

First of all, [00:06:00] congratulations, right? Congratulate them. Tell them what good businesses they've built, how excited you are, like looks really awesome. Um, but like, what did you guys, did you do something differently? Like, it looks like you had a great year in 24, you know, and then that can eliminate some of the things.

The purchase price, you can wait on the multiple. Like, you don't even need to bring that up at this point. I'm not going 

**Gil:** to bring that up. Uh, I did have a conversation with Brian, with, with Ryan about this. Um, I have my strategy. Uh, I, I, I know how to ask the questions. Uh, I think that I'm ready for this.

Yeah. 

**Athena:** Yeah, we're excited. Okay, cool. Good luck. Keep us posted. And I'm sure you and Ryan will connect before then too, but that's exciting. Go right in your wheelhouse too. It's fun when you like know the industry, isn't it? 

**Gil:** Yeah, 

**Athena:** very cool. Nice. Um, Jason, I don't know if your camera's on or if you're here, but I know you've had some interesting developments in your deals lately.

If you wanted to talk about them, because I know you had to jump off [00:07:00] soon. Are you around, Jason? 

**Jason:** Uh, yeah, I'm around. 

**Athena:** Hey, do you want to fill us in? You've got some exciting development on one and not sure on the other. It sounds like, 

**Jason:** uh, yeah, so I guess we could talk, start, start with the crown office suites, um, you know, submitted an L.

O. I. Actually, the numbers that, uh, Ryan and I kind of went over. I was like, I'm just gonna make it 50, 000 less. And then I submitted it. And they essentially came back with, Hey, we need to talk to our CPA to understand the tax implications of this deal. So it kind of threw me off because I was hoping for a little bit of back and forth.

So, you know, that response made me think my offers too high. Did 

**Athena:** they have an asking price on it? [00:08:00] They didn't. Okay. What, what multiple did you end up giving it? Do you remember? 

**Jason:** Uh, hold on, I'll tell you real quick. So I think after I

took another 50 off, it's 2. 3. 

**Athena:** Okay, that's still pretty good. Um, when they said they wanted him to speak to their accountant, were you reading through that as like they're accepting it, they just need to have a conversation, or they're buying some time to review it? 

**Jason:** Uh, well, you know, I asked them to provide me an answer by Wednesday and the broker basically came back and said, that's not going to be possible.

Uh, they're trying to understand these tax implications. So I feeling, and you let me know if I'm wrong, like in an LOI, just, you know, just based on my off market negotiation challenges, I thought there would [00:09:00] be a little bit of like wheeling and dealing about. You know, due diligence time and Seller notes and interest rates like they didn't do any of that.

**Athena:** Yeah. But they also haven't signed it too. So this might just be like, we have to speak to our accountants. It's like buying them time. You know, it could be a strategic play or it just could be naivety. And they're like, we need to have a conversation now because this, this is real. We have a real offer in hand and now we need to move to the next step, you know?

Um, so they might, uh, like until it's signed. I'm always prepared for there to be some back and forth and negotiation and, um, you know, they might go to the accountant and they hadn't considered, uh, I'm assuming you propose an asset sale. Right? So, yes, the broker's like, oh, hey, if it's an asset, so there's going to be, you know, who knows what the broker's doing on their side, how much they prepare them for this at this point, um, but with the [00:10:00] deadline, like, you know, you'll remember, right.

Right. Bill and James David, when they came on and talked about it, they're like, no one ever meets your deadline. It's more a tool for us to put it into to say, like, hey, this offer isn't going to be here forever. You know, so, like, I need you to to move and not just sit on it for weeks and go shop around to other people.

Um, but what's your general like, like, if they came back and they just accepted as is how would you feel about that? 

**Jason:** Uh, you know, this deal is kind of not a slam dunk for me. Do I see myself in this business? No, do I see it adding Cash flow to get out of the gravity of the rat race. Yes. Does it get me completely out?

No, so Um, you know i've talked to ryan about this. I don't see a I don't see a 2x in revenue Opportunity here. I think it could be, you know lifestyle business slow steady earner But it's not something where I think if you [00:11:00] reinvest everything in it, you're going to see like a 2x return. 

**Athena:** Is there a price that it would be a slam dunk for you that it would make it a no brainer?

**Jason:** Uh, it's a good question. I mean. Yeah, I think it's always been. I don't know if there is a price where it makes it something I'm excited about because it just SDS just not enough. I think, you know, I think if you lower the price, it can get you closer to paying off the loan. And then at that point, it has enough, but, um, you know, I think you're just kind of shaving off time instead of.

You know, day one, this is exactly what I want because I, you know, it's just not generating enough cash flow for me to put my W 2. 

**Athena:** Yeah. So then, you know, you've got another deal in hand that, that seems like it's, it's come back online that you are excited about. There's [00:12:00] more to come. I 

**Jason:** am excited about that.

I feel like the seller's a bit of a loose cannon. So every time I talk to him, it's like walking on eggshells. So I don't know. If he still wants to do it, um, I had, you know, I had already, um, drafted an email that was going to go out to him Thursday morning. Ryan mentioned, he gave a great story about, you're at a car rental place, right?

They bake you a cake or something like that. Yeah, that's a good story. So, I, I kind of took that and then wrote him a thank you letter that I sent out Saturday. So, he probably got it either, if not Monday, then he got it today. So, and then the idea was then to follow up with him with an email saying, hey, good news.

Uh, there is a lender that may want to work with us. Uh, maybe all 3 of us can just kind of get on a call. So you are clear and I'm not kind of. Playing telephone and you hear from [00:13:00] the lender what they want, but then I also talked to this other lender today through Pioneer Capital, and he basically is saying essentially the same thing, right?

2024 looks good. Tax returns in 2023 look good. Uh, you know, Tariq already mentioned the seller that he would provide 2024 taxes. Essentially, he just has to reconcile his books from November 2024 till February. And then he can get his money and then I've already got 18 months of his bank statements and his credit card.

So we can do 3 years, but, uh, we can do 18 months. Um, I talked, I talked to Chris and he said, you know, he's done Q of these that were sometimes only a year or 2. [00:14:00] It's not uncommon. 

**Athena:** Okay. So, um, to potential lenders, that's exciting. You've got enough to do a bit of due diligence. And then when we get to the, the legal part where you're drafting the purchase agreement, then that's where you can build in a lot of like reps and warranties, you know, like, if he's not willing to do this, I actually thought of you yesterday, I was going to send you this episode.

Oh, thanks. Um, I was listening to the acquiring minds episode with, uh, this guy that did a sale lease back, um, tell me, I'm assuming you haven't listened to the episode. So I'm not going to teach you new things that I learned from it, but 

**Jason:** I haven't listened to it yet, but I love those podcasts are there's some good ones.

And there's some cautionary tales that. Make you double think some approaches. 

**Athena:** So actually, the sale is back technique is something really interesting. Um, Andrew is going to come on [00:15:00] on Thursday and talk through commercial real estate. And he and I did a pre buyers club chat last week. And we talked about the sale days back.

And like, it's a really interesting strategy. Um, I don't know if it would like, that necessarily would work in tweaks and since is the real estate involved in still and no, 

**Jason:** he rents. 

**Athena:** Okay, so, um, the things that were that I thought were relevant to you were, um, earlier in the episode when he was talking about, he's like, yeah, the difference that I do versus, like, other people is, like, I just keep turning up and getting what I need off of them.

Like, if I need something, I'll just he flew out from Florida to Connecticut. Um, and try to make this guy's life easier by, you know, just being like, Hey, can I jump on your computer and pull this thing down? And that sort of thing. So like he sat with the sellers, he said sometimes for days to get all the information that he needed to like do due diligence.

Um, and then the thing he said at like one [00:16:00] minute 12 in the episode, and I'm looking at my team, maybe someone can write this down and grab that episode link and send it to Jason after this. Um, and something for all of us to think about, and I thought it was really clever, but he's like, When I do these big deals and he, he stood to lose like a couple hundred thousand in broken deals costs if this deal fell apart.

So he's like, I have it in my agreements that, um, they buy back the QV, uh, or, you know, the financial reporting. Or the environmental studies that I do. So, like, if he's paying for things like a QV or in Tariq's case, you know, potentially, like, getting the books. On to something more modern, or to do an environmental study, which you won't need in this case, but like those things that benefit the seller to have those if they wanted to sell, then if the deal doesn't go through, then you have it in the [00:17:00] agreement that they buy them back.

So they, they pay for. That QV, or they pay for that financial exercise. So you can say, as long as we close the deal, there's no risk for you because I, I need it to have like confidence and peace of mind, but if for whatever reason, you change your mind. Right? And, and we don't close. I'm going to have you buy back that QV report for me, because that's going to serve you.

Well, if you ever want to try to sell this, I'm going to have you buy back the accounting bookkeeping transfer. Um, because that was going to need to happen if you were going to sell to anybody else. So, um, yeah, I think it was 1 minute or 1 hour 14, 1 hour 12 in that episode. I really think you should listen to that.

Because in this instance, maybe then you could get him over the. What was the, what was the, um, what was his objection to you modernizing the books in order to get a sale done? Do you remember specifically? It was 

**Jason:** around the cost of goods sold. He just didn't [00:18:00] track his raw material. Like, you know, if you obviously get the orders, but he didn't track how much material it took to manufacture a unit, 

**Athena:** but still his, his accounting system is on something that's like, not able to be used or worked.

Right? So, 

**Jason:** yeah, he just was, you know, I just, I take it, it's kind of a situation where someone's kind of stuck in how they've done stuff and it's always worked and. You know, I even offered to come in here, help him figure out how to modernize his books, find someone that's capable of doing it. He just wasn't really interested, but I think this, this approach is even better.

So, you know, if he's, if he already has an accounting practice in place, and he just has to not do 12 months, but do, like, the last 4 months, I think it's a, it's an easier ask than. And [00:19:00] like, the modernization was like a complete no go for him. 

**Athena:** Yeah. Um, I mean, you're going to have to do it regardless. He's going to have to go through that.

Yeah, I feel like I'm going to have to do it, 

**Jason:** but it's like. 

**Athena:** No, but you'll, you'll have to do it with his computer and with him. Anyway, 

**Jason:** yeah, I mean, there's, it's almost like the things that are in there aren't. Really valuable and we'll have to start over from. Nothing. 

**Athena:** Yeah. Um, so did he, does he, what do you know why he wants to sell what he wants to do?

**Jason:** Uh, yeah, it's just, um, he doesn't want to sell to his kids. He wants to spend more time with his grandkids and he wants to move closer to his daughters and he wants to travel. 

**Athena:** So when people start putting up objections, like you, you need to [00:20:00] remind them of why they're doing this. Right. So like, and this can feel like objection handling still is one of the sales techniques that I struggle with the most.

Because when people are like, no, I'm like, okay, you know, so I think you and I probably share that Jason is just like, somebody says no. And it's like, I don't want to, I don't want to, you know, like you said, stepping on eggshells, but actually. He has a problem and he is not going to be able to sell that business.

He is not going to be able to retire, spend more time with his grandkids and move away. If he does not work with someone to do that. 

**Jason:** Right? So I know to me, this is, I think it's a, it feels like a win win the situation we're at now where we kind of have a path forward. 

**Athena:** Right? I think it doesn't have to modernize.

This is a learning for you regardless, right? So, like, when somebody puts up an objection, like, [00:21:00] no, I don't want to, I don't know cogs and it's like, okay, I understand that. But, like, you said you wanted to move and be closer to your grandkids, right? You want to spend more time with your grandkids. Yeah. Like when did you want to do that?

You know, um, in the next couple of years, how are you planning on selling if you're not willing to do the things that, that help us sail forward, you know, so it's like just walking them back to what their overall goal is and asking questions to help them understand that if he wants that thing to happen and a sale of this business to happen.

You're giving him a lifeline that other people are not going to give, they're not even going to give it a consideration with it in this situation. You know, so it's like, well, how do you anticipate you're going to sell your business if you're not willing to work with me on on validating the information so I can get the loan?

Like, how are you? How else are you planning on selling the business? You know, 

**Jason:** yeah, no, we talked about all this. [00:22:00] This is kind of where I was just going to follow up with him every couple of months. Thanks. To say like, you know, how are you going to, how are you going to sell this business? You know, like he's pretty adamant about not modernizing big county.

Like I, I can tell when someone digs in their heels to me, like after a while, keep talking about it. It's not going to, it's not, it's almost like not helpful. It's kind of, I, my feeling is, but let time, you know, give him time to reflect on what's the situation and what, what options he has to go forward.

**Athena:** Yeah. Um, do you have a relationship where you speak to him on the phone or has it been primarily email? 

**Jason:** No, no, I can call him. I feel like I can call him whenever, like I said, I feel like I have a pretty good rapport with him. So, um, I'm pretty comfortable with calling him. 

**Athena:** So your next step then, rather than email, do you think it might be better to do a phone call?

**Jason:** Yeah, I could probably, uh, I was thinking about [00:23:00] maybe giving him a call tomorrow, tomorrow morning. Morning is really light

and then just tell them, you know, I got a situation where I can get you what you want. Spend more time with your wife, travel, spend time with the grandkids. And I got a lender that's going to make that happen. If you're still interested. 

**Athena:** Yeah. Um, I check in and make sure he still wants to sell too. 

**Jason:** Like, yeah, that'd be the first question.

**Athena:** Yeah, like, how are you feeling about selling? You know, like, um, when, when, like, has your timeline changed at all? Like, has it changed whether you want to spend time with your grandkids? Like, remind him of the timeline and everything? Because Jason, even when you get a term sheet. There's going to be a lot of work for him to do on the, after, after you, you get that, [00:24:00] you know, the due diligence that you're going to have to do the paperwork.

You're going to have to get off of him. Like, it's going to still be a lot of work and you need him like committed and understanding that. So, if he's like, put in the work to modernize the books, like, there's no way that you get the information that you need to make sure that. 

**Jason:** Well, I will say we provided all of the Q and B information that we asked for.

Okay. Um, he, like the next day he provided all the bank statements via CSV. He called the bank. He went to the bank, got all the PDFs over the last three years. He got the credit card statements and like he did that on a Saturday. 

**Athena:** Okay. Okay. So just, you know, like also reminding him like, Hey, I know this is a lot of work, but at the end of this, I'm going to put millions of dollars in your pocket.

You know, that's what the guy on the podcast like kept it. And I think it was good like to keep reminding them when they're like. I'm trying to run the business. I don't have time to do this. I don't want to do this. I'm like, I get that. I'm here. I'm going to try to make it as easy. I'll come to your office and get those things [00:25:00] off of you.

But if you do this, you're going to have millions of dollars in your pocket and be able to spend more time with your grandkids at the end of this. You know, I think 

**Jason:** that's the first question is like, do you want to sell? If he says yes. And then I'd say, all right, I got a path forward to get you 1. 7 million.

**Athena:** I would, I would, I would revisit the goals and the vision before you do that. Like, do you want to sell? Um, you know, why are you selling again? Like, you told me you wanted to spend more time with your grandkids. Has that changed? Has that timeline shifted at all? Like, really get him visualizing and like, adamant about like, no, this is what I want to do.

Because when people see the vision, then they're a lot more amenable to it. As opposed to like, if you just leave it at like, do you want to sell? And he's like, yeah. You know, but like, it's like, well, why do you want to sell, you know, it's like reminding them there. Why? And like, what this means at the other end of this, then can, can kind of help get the buy in for what comes next.

So, and a phone call is a great way to do that. If you [00:26:00] already have that relationship with him, rather than an email, I don't love, 

**Jason:** yeah, I can do that. I'm sorry. I got to get 

**Athena:** a drop. Okay, cool. Um, well, good luck. Keep us posted. Um, exciting that this one has back online. It, you know, deals die at least three times.

So you've had, you've had one so far, two more to come. 

**Jason:** Oh, I hope not. Don't 

**Athena:** say that. Nice. Good luck, Jason. Keep us posted. 

**Jason:** See ya. Thanks. 

**Athena:** Thanks. Cool. Who else have we got here? Let's see. Oh, I see Joe's here. Joe, you, you're working on some stuff with your deals. How's that going? 

**Joe:** Hey, Athena. 

**Athena:** Hey, 

**Joe:** um, good. I hope I don't know anything else to compare to.

So do 

**Athena:** you want to update us? Because you're, you're, uh, you know, Kind of moving through the process post LOI on [00:27:00] one and awaiting some news. I think on the second one still right? 

**Joe:** Yes, um, I can't remember what I would have last shared on either. Um, but I can tell you the status. Um, and I was late getting on this call because I, I had about a 15 minute call with Wendy Gormley.

Oh, how'd that go? Oh, it was good. It was fine. Um. She, I'm trying to put things back on her plate sort of thing. Um, so let me just, I guess I'll start from last week. So last week I was unable because of my schedule and just stuff happened late week. I couldn't meet or have a call with the seller. We had that call yesterday.

Uh, he actually, the main portion of the call was Talking about a couple discrepancies that were called out by Wendy. Um, and then a couple things that she says Hey, [00:28:00] you may just want to make sure you talk it through with the seller on namely, uh Temporarily, I'll call it leasing his contractor license for the HVAC company um also talking through I guess there's a hard and fast rule about SBA where if there is An equity owner in the business, they can't stay on as a W2 employee past 12 months.

I don't know if you guys know that already, or does everyone on the call know that? Yeah. Um, I think I had heard it before, but I had to re emphasize that with the seller. And he said, yeah, you know, shouldn't be an issue. And it sounds like there's, there can be ways, I want to say around that, but to continue the work.

Right? So, um, the point is I broached it on as a topic on the call, you know, did, did my job on that worry about it, you know, many months in after transaction. [00:29:00] Um, we talked about the fleet of vehicles and the assets. Uh, Wendy's more concerned about the age of the vehicles. We probably need to build in a little stronger CapEx story in there.

So I talked with her about that today. Uh, and then the rest of it, I had the seller help me finish a questionnaire sheet that I didn't realize I didn't have to complete, which Wendy only told me today. 

**Athena:** So they 

**Joe:** send out, it's like a, they call it a lender master questionnaire about the business. So she sends it on an email with a few other documents and all the other documents were just kind of informational and reading.

They weren't homework to complete, but this one, this one six page document was. So I, I, me being me, I, I'm like, okay, God, I got to do this now. So I jumped on it on Sunday afternoon and started working on it. And it went quick because I've had a lot of good calls at meetings with the seller, knew a lot about his business already.[00:30:00] 

So I filled out probably 90 percent of it, maybe more. And then the ones I didn't know, I put, you know, I put an asterisk to ask the seller. So we talked about those items yesterday. Um, what kind of came up is the AR, the aging AR from last year, you know, live Oak wants to know about what does the 90 plus day column look like?

Well, I didn't pay much attention to it. When I received the report, I just sent it to Wendy, you know, a couple of weeks ago, it shows that negative 84, 000. In the, in the 90 plus column. So, of course, Wendy wants to know about that, and I do too, so I, I bring it up to the seller yesterday and he's like, I don't know what you're talking about.

So I, I sent a screenshot of it in the email after our call as like a follow up task list. I said, Pino, please address this with your accountant, you know, kind of important, right? And then the other thing I realized we're missing altogether in the documents is [00:31:00] an aging AP report. And of course, the lenders want to know.

You know, uh, payment terms, payment cycles to your suppliers, right? And vendors. So I'm realizing I don't even have that sheet at all. So I've asked that of him. Um, next step. Sorry, everyone's quiet. I still have everyone, right? 

**Athena:** Yeah, yeah, yeah. Listening and taking notes. 

**Joe:** I'm doing a lot of talking. Sorry. Um, so he helped me complete the questionnaire.

I'm pretty much done with it. And then I, again, I find out I don't have to give it to Wendy. But she says, Joe, you're so good. Well, at least if anything, you know everything about the business, you're going to want to know that. Right? So I said, okay, well, um, and the next step is my next follow up is I'm going to make Friday happen with Pino and worst a call, but I'm sure I'm going to offer to take him to lunch or late breakfast or something, an in person meetup, right?

We've already [00:32:00] had a couple weekly, uh, phone calls and you guys suggest, and I believe in in person meetings. Yes. You know, gauging those interactions. Um, and here on your, your, your, uh, just the earlier part of the conversation around, uh, objections from sellers, uh, that kind of came up yesterday on my call with him.

I wouldn't call it an objection, but it seemed like it was a little bit of an annoyance to him. Uh, you know, I don't know why it's my A. R. Shows that or Oh, no, I need to get you the A. P. I said, Well, you know, if you know, I've asked for it, but no big deal. You know, anyway, I can help you, man. I'm only I can only go as fast as, you know, be finding out what we still need from you.

And then I brought up around, you know, every day that goes by, you know, I'm trying to work fast on this and you mentioned once the busy season happens, it's gonna be harder. And so I kind of built in that milestone timeline. That he needs to keep [00:33:00] his eyes on the prize as well because once it starts getting busy season Um, just a transition could be more difficult and frankly selfishly that that worries me, right?

**Athena:** Yeah, 

**Joe:** let alone just making the transaction happen. So Uh, I should have a good gauging meeting friday with him is the next step Um and trying to fill in some of those gaps the aging reports. Um, learning more about the licensing process 

**Athena:** And what's 

**Joe:** really needed requirements, pre reqs, is it a number of hours, how much money, how much time, studying versus on site work, blah, blah, blah.

And actually it reminded me too, I'm long overdue for getting a hold of a family friend. He owns a very large HVAC company, more on my side of Tampa Bay. And he's, he's put me off a few times. I mean, busy dude, right? Everyone is, but I'm going to hold them to it. I mean, and be able to ask him all these [00:34:00] things and it'll be, I think it'll be really good specifically through this process.

And really understand how the running of the operations of a business, an HVAC business, the industry itself, challenges, things to look out for, labor, assets, vehicles, customers, all that. 

**Athena:** Yeah, 

**Joe:** I love that. Yeah, so it's, uh, it's something that's been in the back of my mind. I caught my family contact, uh, it was a number of weeks ago, so I'm overdue for actually getting them out.

I just need to force it. So, talking through this sort of stuff helps me on my action list. Um, That's mainly it. Any questions on that one? Otherwise, there's also the other LOI that's still out there. 

**Athena:** Yeah, I'll come. We'll touch on that one in a second. So on the AR and AP, this is good. This is coming up because I remember before you got under LOI, it was like, oh, no, there's no AR or AP.

Like, it's just You know, gosh, so it's good to kind of uncover this [00:35:00] stuff and see what's going on there. And hopefully it's just an accounting error. But also, if you do actually need working capital, it's better to know. Right? So, like, if there actually is unpaid services or an amount of time that you need to get paid, this is great to find this stuff out and, you know, like, A lot of sellers don't understand their own books.

They just know their bank account. They do bank account accounting, right? Like, it's like, if I have enough in the bank account, I know what payroll is going to cost that sort of thing. So, uh, it's not like they're running their business is bad. That's just, um, P and L's and balance sheets and aging reports.

Like, most of them don't deeply understand those. So they're kind of learning as they go through this process to, um, with, uh. So, um, I think you were speaking to another lender too. Have you gotten to the point of term sheets yet or you need the Arap to be able to get some term sheets. Yeah, 

**Joe:** um still need [00:36:00] Uh still need clarity on those two items frankly.

Um, they also Wendy was putting a lot of um emphasis on the license process She still wanted to know more about it, which it's kind of surprising because I I I she made it seem like live oak loves Hvac companies, uh for transactions and I just would assume she would have known a little bit about it, but if everything's different state by state or whatever, I mean, no problem.

It takes some research and and again, if I can get a hold of my my industry contact, that'd be. That'd be the holy grail, I think, of understanding it 

**Athena:** all. Yeah, it is different state by state. Now, so, the, having a seller on W2 payroll for 12 months, like, you can have them consult on the business post 12 months.

Yes, 

**Joe:** that, right. I mean, it's that easy. And I told Pino, the seller, that. I said, Hey, look, [00:37:00] I'm just bringing it up because it's a topic. I said, and look, if his wife wants to keep working and she's doing great for me, of course, we would want to keep that going. I said, we'll figure out a way whether that means 1099.

So that means have a, keep an, make an entity and LLC as a consultant business and I can hire your entity as a consult. It just can't be W 2. And then he's like, okay, it makes sense. I'm like, great. That's it. Right. So as long as we touched on it. So I 

**Athena:** just wanted to clarify that for everybody listening, because you can, you can absolutely have the seller involved past 12 months, such as how you have them involved matters for SBA guidelines.

But there's ways around that. Like I quite like having it be consultancy agreement. Um, you know, where it's like up to this number of hours, because if you get in there and seller ends up being a nightmare, then you have an out, you haven't, like, committed to a full time salary for a year or whatever.

That's like, we, we imagine that it will be up to this amount. [00:38:00] So, um, you know, with Nash's story the other day, like, he was like, okay, Mr. Seller, it's time for you to head out, you know, like, I will call you if I need you. Because if they're and I, I'm seeing that with, you know, some other businesses as the seller just kind of turns a little bit afterwards and they don't like the changes and they don't like the shift.

So, at some point, you want that out to be able to get them out. But if we've agreed that they're going to be working full time or set, like, you're going to be working this many hours as opposed to up to. This number of hours, and then you get the control of, like, deciding how much that is. Right? Um, but yeah, so you can, you can have the seller involved and I do like seeing, you know, like, a consultancy agreement, even post 12 months.

Where it's like, you know, an hourly thing or up to so many hours of phone support or something that if you need them, because, like, with Ranaan's [00:39:00] story, you know, being through a full year, it's like, there's a lot that you learn in an annual cycle also, so having them on the other end of the phone, if you need them, um.

You can build that in. So, um, sounds like you're learning a lot and the licensing is different. I do know you can lease the license there. So it just might not be that she's familiar with for Florida laws. Um, are you speaking to any other lenders or just her right now? 

**Joe:** Um, I am. And, uh, the other one was one that I've known for a couple of years, you know, when I started the process, um, before even meeting you all.

And she's been just very straightforward, easy to understand, very, um, responsive. So, until I, until I think I have a good rhythm on how all this is working, I'm just trying to keep it to those two. Ryan Tancy recommended a couple others that I'm on emails with. 

**Athena:** I would just 

**Joe:** be, I would be too overwhelmed if I [00:40:00] was trying to juggle three.

Let me, let me learn from the first, you know, with Wendy and then the other one. And if I, if I feel like I want to get a third, uh, and can handle the rigor of it and fast forward it, like the guy Tooney, Tooney or Toomey, um, he seemed like a pretty hungry young dude, but it was almost like too aggressive, too fast for me.

So I'm like, well, he could be good. If and once I get everything together, and I'm already on a little more, I don't know, further down the road or cruise control with Wendy and the other one. The other one is called, uh, I think it's DFCU Financial. It's like a credit union. Um, 

**Athena:** they're national. Are they a preferred lender?

**Joe:** I believe so. 

**Athena:** Okay, so double check if they're a preferred SBA lender, because what that means is that they don't need to go get sign off from SBA. They can make the decisions themselves on a loan. Um, if they're not a preferred lender, then, um, that [00:41:00] can just create a lot of, um, issues for actually, because like, because the SBA program is so attractive to like any lender, um, because of the, the government backed portion of it, then a lot of like smaller community banks try to do it, but they're not necessarily experienced in getting it over the line.

So that's the difference in preferred lender, preferred SBA Is that a preferred letter can, like, take the decision themselves. They don't have to then go be like, please, Mr. SBA. Is this okay? Um, if they're not a preferred lender, then you just want to see how much experience they have with this. Particular type of deal and being successful with SBA so that you don't end up, you know.

Except walking down the path with somebody that doesn't have experience of getting approvals. I don't know who this person is, but. Like, if they're a preferred lender, they've got experience with SBA and then you can look at like how many deals or what volume or what size that they've closed.[00:42:00] 

We got you and then, um, getting, getting as 

**Joe:** you were just talking, I apologize because I want to say you and I, we talked about this. And I, I'm on their website real quick. Uh, they have a section under SBA loans. It says SBA preferred SBA lender. As an SBA preferred lender, we are able to provide a streamlined approach, SBA approval process, da, da, da.

So I think that was one of the reasons why I originally got with them. Anyways, from a suggestion from a broker two, three years ago. 

**Athena:** Great. Okay, cool. That's, that's awesome then. So then, yeah, like if, if you're liking both of them, then, you know, getting a term sheet. Before before signing a commitment letter, so the term sheet is just like, we would loan under these terms, um, and then and then you can kind of make a decision from there, like, which one you want to walk forward with, but it's, I like to see at least 2 term sheets if you can, so you can see what the different rates in [00:43:00] terms are that they're offering.

Um, yeah, the way I 

**Joe:** see it, at least getting to a 3rd, if I can make it happen with just all things considered and. Bandwidth I have. Yeah, why not? Um, so that's where my head is at. Um, yeah, I think things are pretty evident right now and what Wendy still needs and what I need to get from the seller. So, uh, Friday should be hopefully good or.

A useful meeting. 

**Athena:** Yeah. No, I love that you're making the time to meet him in person because that, that goes so far, even though I know you're super busy, but like, this is going to start feeling daunting for him too. So that personal touch of like, Hey, I know this is tough. It's tough on me too, but we're in this together, you know, and I want to, I want to get you retired and over the finish line just as much as I want to become a business owner.

[00:44:00] So. Um, I love that you're doing that. How are you feeling about the, um, the other one? 

**Joe:** Um, the other one's, uh, the other one is kind of pins and needles. Um, I still really like it, at least in my mind, just based on what I see at the moment. Um, uh, uh, the challenge over the past week has been, Right when I submitted the LOI, it was maybe the night before one of the owners went out to the UK, where he's from.

And, uh, he gets back, I think, tomorrow, is what the broker said. So, of course, I submitted the LOI, I think it was Monday. Uh, I put a one week expiration, so the letter's expired. Um, it is between my offer and one other, which is a cash only. And, and stop me if I've already talked about this to the group, I just can't remember.

Sorry, guys. I want to say, yeah, I was told this information last Thursday [00:45:00] evening when the broker called me. So I don't know if this would have come up on our call or not. But they said that there was a contingency that the cash offer they were not super comfortable with or balking at. It had to do with like an earn out.

Um, from what I understand, I thought it was that asking price. And so knowing that, um, you know, it, it puts me at a disadvantage knowing that, hey, you know, this, this would force the sellers if they went with me, it'd be through the SBA process, which is a little arduous as we're learning. Uh, but I went and looked back at my model also, and I was, I was trying to feed a couple of things to the broker saying, hey, look.

Um, you know, looking forward to update. I really would. I really want this business. Um, and I said, look, if the, if the guys, I, I kind of was goading the, the broker do Hey, if the guys want to negotiate, please let's negotiate. Cause I left plenty, [00:46:00] plenty of room, even 

**Athena:** in the, even in 

**Joe:** the model, just on the asking price.

Now, again, it's a niche kind of company, right? It's playground and safety surface and all this and that. They have a pretty big fast food chain customer that is a regular business. They get pretty big projects. Their popularity, from what their projects are saying, they have very big projects at substantial places.

And, I mean, I could increase my ask, the offer price by 200, 000 and still be at over a 1. 5, like a 1. 55 debt service. Nice. But their, their asking price was low, so I'm like, okay, I'm going to give you your asking price. I didn't, I was hoping it wouldn't be so competitive. Um, right now, and I, right now my LOI shows a 10 percent seller note, straightforward.

And I said, look, let me know if you want a 5%, just negotiate with me, right? I'm begging to be negotiated with on it. So that's kind of the flavor of it. I've been on the broker a bit, [00:47:00] giving him the courtesy, of course, of only communicating with him, even though I have the cell phone numbers of the other guys.

I wouldn't go around the broker and trying to build that rapport with him getting into like me. So, uh, I'm, I'm, my next step in my mind is ringing them up. Uh, if it is, if it's not tonight, it's tomorrow when the other, when the other owner gets back, really just showing, you know, urgency over the matter. Um, if it's another meetup offer that offer negotiation or something.

Something that would work against the cash offer. 

**Athena:** Yeah, I mean, an earn out means that they'll, so, do you know what their plans are for leaving? Like when, like they want to be done now, or they want to stay? 

**Joe:** Yeah, so there's two, there's three owners. One is silent, so he doesn't matter, he doesn't operate. The other two, uh, think of, let's say owner A, uh, he's the one that has apparently 34 percent ownership of the business.

So he's, [00:48:00] you know, I guess he's, he's the majority equity owner. He's the one that has the shorter timeline. Uh, he claims 30 days of a transition. He only handles the, the, the, the fast food chain, um, business, which is the safety floor. And he says for every order, it's like two hours of work, paper pushing, a couple of calls.

And it keeps the lights on, it pays the bills, right? So that's the good residual and regular business. Yeah. Um, I asked about the future of that, and they said that, you know, they have, uh, their expansion plans are, uh, like doubling over the next 10 years. And they already have like 6 or 8, 000 store units.

Okay. So, and then they have replacement businesses now. So he's the one on the, to answer you though, he's the short term owner, 30 days. Um, the second owner, he's the one that handles the heavier playground equipment. He does the [00:49:00] shows, the trade shows more. He does more of uh, maybe some interest group meetings.

He handles the suppliers. Um, he would like to stick around through November. So that's actually a lot of good time for a transition. I built in a plan for a transition to his duties, but also paying him. And I put in some specifics on how I would pay him, uh, trying to kind of keep him whole and motivated and incentivized.

And again, that, that's a, it was a decent portion of the LOI. I'm like, Hey, look, negotiate with me. Like, give me something back. Show me you're interested. Right? 

**Athena:** Yeah, so the, so that, that is your advantage, actually. If owner A, who holds the fast food chain relationships. Wants out quickly. Mm-hmm . Then not all cash offer that has an earnout probably has them tied to the business for two years.

Yeah. [00:50:00] So yeah. Your, your, your, your disadvantage is always your advantage in these situations, right? Like, I always am like, what, what do you think is your disadvantage? They're showing up with all cash. That all cash comes with contingencies. , right? It's like. It's not all cash. It's all cash, but you have to stay in the business for 2 years, um, and, and get it to do the double thing that you think your business is going to be able to do.

I'm guessing, you know, that's usually that's classic P. E. like, they want the owners to stay in the business and get it to where they think, you know, it can go. 

**Joe:** Well, one thing I didn't ask though, I didn't, I didn't ask though and the broker didn't say if it was a PE type thing, right? So what if it was just some guy who had a million dollars laying around and I don't know if he's in the industry or whatnot.

I don't have more detail around it. So it could just be a private buyer, an individual. 

**Athena:** Yeah, that's like not [00:51:00] great leverage, though, to just show up all cash as an individual like, oh, I'm not saying it is 

**Joe:** either, right? 

**Athena:** Yeah, 

**Joe:** I can only hope because you're right P there's and you told me that on a previous deal It's an advantage for them, but it's a disadvantage based on the the timing of someone, you know Yeah, the sellers wanted to get out of the business their exit, right?

**Athena:** Yeah, and I, I wonder if this other buyer has, like, taken the time, like, you have to go and meet all of them and get to know them. And so, again, that's your advantage. And, like, I know you're being nice with the broker, but also, like, getting another seller meeting in before they make a decision wouldn't necessarily be a bad thing either.

Because then you could be like, hey, you know, I know you probably don't want to talk about the other specifics, but. Um, you know, how's it going? How are you feeling about this process? Are they trying to, like, lock you in for a couple of years? That's typically what they do, you know, you know, feel, you know, 

**Joe:** and maybe this is a [00:52:00] good time with, you know, I, I get to the broker say, Hey, look, I know Pete, the owner, he's, he's getting back.

Um, Hey, look, and my otherwise are expired, you know, let's say legally when it comes to that part, um, would it hurt for one, one more meetup? Let's have both of them in the same room. Because I'm LOI anyways. 

**Athena:** Yeah, worth a shot. I mean, it's worth a shot, right? Like, the only thing you have to lose is this deal.

Yeah. So, it might feel uncomfortable to propose that, but if you really like this one, then they'll No, I'm not uncomfortable 

**Joe:** asking for it at all. Yeah, because, you know, the worst thing that happens is I didn't ask and I don't get it, right? Yeah. I can still ask 

**Athena:** and 

**Joe:** I don't get it. 

**Athena:** And then if you can get another meet with them before they've made a decision, then that, that opens up the opportunity to talk about, like, you know, what, what did you guys, like, what were you excited about?

What were you [00:53:00] not excited about? Like, how are you feeling about things? Um, you know, with those corporate relationships, those can be hard to like transition. So if, if the dude that has the relationships with corporates is out after 30 days, Then like what happens if those relationships don't transfer and that sort of thing so you can kind of talk about the real terms, you know, and just be like, Hey, yeah, um, you know, that that's a real thing so I could even push up the purchase price, you know, and attach it to some things that you guys help me with or, you know, whatever customer concentration not being lost, you know, like a performance note attached to the those key customers not leaving, um, um, So, yeah, I think, I think it's a good play because you already have a relationship with them.

They haven't made a decision yet. They're deliberating and it sounds like this guy wants out [00:54:00] quickly and typically all cash out offers within an earn out literally means like they're going to have to earn out that price over a period of time by working in the business. I can't imagine any earn out.

It's going to be like 30 days. 

**Joe:** No, so I will, um, I'll take that suggestion and, um, ask for that for sure. And, uh Yeah, so I, again, I like that one. One thing that's recently cropped up, though, that it's, it's not, it's not pushing me away from the deal, but just the recent world and global news and economy of, uh, all these tariffs now, right?

Um, and one of the major equipment suppliers for this particular company is based in Canada. 

**Athena:** And it's 

**Joe:** their go to higher end, more durable playground equipment. So, you know, just funny timing [00:55:00] as all this comes up, you know, in the, in the world and global economics and me talking with a company like this, I think it affects, I mean, let's face it, it affects a lot of businesses.

A lot of stuff comes from not America, not the USA. Right. Um, so, but the, the, the market adapts a matter of how quickly and some of these manufacturers, how quickly they're going to. Yeah. And frankly, that, that can be, if, if I. If they're talking with me, that's kind of a downside of buying the business. And they see, they should see that as a risk for any buyer.

Uh, you know, how do they, how do they make any buyer comfortable around that? 

**Athena:** Exactly. So you should bring that up. Like, this is a major concern of mine. I buy this business, you leave after 30 days. I know all of a sudden have, you know, a supplier that has tariffs to pay or, you know, and yeah, because yeah, 

**Joe:** I'm outpriced.

Right. So, 

**Athena:** yeah, so there's some give and take 

**Joe:** on it. [00:56:00] Yeah, 

**Athena:** I 

**Joe:** think the key is, yeah, they truly haven't made a decision. I think I would do well in front of them. I see that, uh. That's fine. 

**Athena:** Yeah. And you have two good deals in hand, you know, so like the, the being able to kind of like do the pluses and minuses of both, you know, and, and work on them and keep working them, you know, to the point where it's like an obvious, no is, is good.

So it's a lot to manage all at once, but you're doing great. 

**Joe:** Try my best. So that is the deal. 

**Athena:** Awesome. Well, very cool. You feel good. Anything else we can help with on that stuff? Joe. 

**Joe:** Nope, just day to day trying to keep my head above water. So 

**Athena:** yeah, well, this is this is the fun. So you're doing great. Um, Ryan and the team and me are obviously here.

So keep us posted on how it goes. Let us know if you're able to get the other meeting in. Good stuff. Good chats [00:57:00] today. Good movement happening on some of these deals. Um, Thursday, our very own Andrew is going to be joining Buyer's Club, and he's going to be teaching us about commercial real estate. So specifically, you know, how it can factor into a deal.

I even asked him to do some one on one for those of us that don't know anything about commercial real estate. Like, how is it valued? And what do you look for? Um, and then, you know, just kind of talking through, like, Leasing versus buying, and then there's some really interesting, um, plays that you can make with real estate, um, but specifically also having real estate in a deal, just on a, like, if you were to package it into a 7a might extend the payments on the loan, like Nash told us, you know, he did a 6 million acquisition, but he's making payments over 25 years for that, um, so, Should be fun topic of conversation.

I know we've got folks that are clued up with real estate too. So we'll open it up and have a dialogue and a discussion about [00:58:00] it. Um, we're going to drop that sale lease back link in the buyer's club too. That was the, um, conversation that I was having with Jason about the sale lease back technique, but it's an interesting one to just have in your back pocket as a technique.

If you come across a piece of substantial real estate And how you could potentially use that as a way to finance the deal. Um, if the sellers you view on the valuation and what you could actually get with the commercial rents and everything are wildly different, you can end up using that sale of business to get some money back.

So that should be a really fun conversation. Real estate is something that I am trying to learn a lot more of, cause I, I love businesses. Um, Gil, I saw your hand up. Did you have a question? 

**Gil:** I just want to comment, uh, last week. Acquiring minds had a webinar about selling spec as well. Yeah. Okay. Just want to make sure.

Absolutely. Yeah. 

**Athena:** Yeah, so, um, I think that the [00:59:00] webinar I listened to that too. It dives. I just want to echo that into details that you kind of like, you want to listen to the episode first to get some context. And because they dived straight into that, how to and it's like, whoa, whoa, whoa, where did this even come up?

So, I'd recommend listening to the podcast 1st and then if you like that, you can dive into the webinar, but hopefully Andrew's gonna give us some color in terms of, you know, that as a play in the 1st instance. And if you come across some deals where you're like, I think this could work for that. Then the acquiring minds webinar is an amazing resource to for like the specifics and how the deal is structured and stuff too.

So thanks for pointing that out, Gil. Um, we're always learning and sharing and there's so much to learn literally like endless amounts of things to learn with deal making. So. We're going to keep trying to bring things that help you all, uh, do it quicker. Um, as always, like, you know, send us ideas of topics and things that you would like to explore.

So we're working on, you know, getting someone to talk through financial statements in a very simple way, right? Like what are balance [01:00:00] sheets and AR reports like, you know, most of us have never looked at that before this world. So, um, we're going to do some of that. We're going to get some SBA lenders in here.

I want to get Renan back to talk through like, you know, the, his approach to selling the seller and rapport building and stuff like that. So any other ideas that you have, keep sending them. That's why we keep finding, uh, these folks to come and share and hopefully, um, You know, Nash's, we didn't get a chance to talk through Nash's, but, like, I thought it was such a cool conversation to hear from someone.
