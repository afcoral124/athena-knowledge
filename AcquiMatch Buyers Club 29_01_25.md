# AcquiMatch Buyers Club 29/01/25

[00:00:00] 

**Athena:** Hello. Hey, Gil. Hello. How's it going? Wonderful. And yourself? I'm really good. Thanks. I am on the road to recovery. I'm happy. Feeling human again.

Awesome. We got everyone here as well. Hi. Cool. Welcome. Welcome. Um, so today we were gonna, we, we, Tuesdays are kind of the day we can talk through any active 

deals, challenges, that sort of thing. So, I think Joe, we wanted to talk through where you're at right now, if you're up for it. Um, and then also what I wanted to do was just take you all through the resource that's on your dashboard about the post LOI process, since we have a few folks that are circling deals right now.

Um, Hey, 

**Joe:** Lindsay, hello. Nice to see 

**Lindsay:** you. Coming up for [00:01:00] air. Business 

**Joe:** owner number two. Lindsay closed on a business on uh, December 30th, number two for her and Kevin. So, super excited for 

**Lindsay:** you. Congratulations. Yeah, thank you. Um, I haven't been able to carve out time to join this group in a bit, but. We're getting there.

**Athena:** Amazing. Cool. Well, um, so we're going to talk a little bit about the post process. So, Lindsay actually knows this quite well, because she's been through it twice now, um, and just want to make sure that y'all kind of are prepared for when you do, because what happens next it's kind of everything all at once and it's like, you know, just racing against the clock and it's hurry up and wait.

So if you kind of know what's coming when you're closer to it, then you can be prepared and also just wanted to chat through how we support you through that process to, um, we're recording this because we have a couple other folks that are pretty close to signing an also. So I won't spend too much time talking at you, [00:02:00] but.

I think it's good when you're close to it to just hear it. And then you can dig in, ask any questions about the process too. So it's not just a static document on your dashboards. Um, and obviously there's nuances and differences with every single deal, but this is kind of the general structure. That we recommend that you go through.

So I'm going to get that pulled up here. So you all should be hopefully familiar with your resources at this point. If you don't know where it is, you can't find it. I believe it's in your canvas on your slack channel, but Anca will be able to direct you. To this, um, so we're adding more and more resources.

The more we get to it. All of the call recordings are here also with the resources there. So, where we're going today is this post checklist and process and I'm going to pull that up now and just talk through it with you all. Um, so, let's see, can I [00:03:00] share.

Okay, well, we'll just roll through it here. So this document, I really recommend that y'all kind of go through it and go through it a couple times. Um, and definitely as you're going through this process. So, once you sign an ally, uh, then you kind of kick into project manager gear and there's a lot of different things to do and.

It's important to kind of do things in a certain order so that you can save yourself money in the process and not get, you know, people starting to pay people before you've done other things in the process. So there's a sequential order that we typically recommend at this point as well. And then how to work with us during this process.

Process is we recommend that you set up a weekly meeting with Ryan to kind of support you through this process and have like a pulse meeting. Obviously, you can [00:04:00] schedule meetings in and around that, but it's just really helpful to know that you've got that weekly time locked in. So you can go through the things that come up as you go through this process.

Um, so you want to get those set up with us. You also want us to review the term sheets that you get from lenders. I'll talk through what that is in a minute. Um, and then ideally, you keep us CC on communications with all of the folks that you're dealing with on your deal team, the brokers, the lawyers, et cetera, and tell them, hey, I'm just keeping the team CC.

So that we have context when we're able to talk you through things. Um, and then really importantly is don't kill a deal without talking to us first. So some things can come up during the due diligence process that might feel like deal killers to you, but actually can be deal adjustments. There's things that can be, you know, adjustments made in the overall structure of the deal.

Uh, in the terms that make it okay. So just before you kill [00:05:00] anything, make sure you talk to us 1st, um, because it might just be an adjustment. And then, you know, you're basically the project manager throughout this process. So, once we've handed over an opportunity, and you've gotten it into, we can't negotiate on your behalf, but we're absolutely here as part of your team to support you, talk you through how to do it the strategy.

There's a lot of nuances and negotiations and things that come up. So, you know, we want to support you through that process. So the 1st thing after you get an ally that we recommend you do is start speaking to lenders and getting term sheets from lenders. And a term sheet is basically. Uh, there's different words for it might be a pre flight might be a term sheet.

Um, and it tells you what the bank is willing to lend you, you know, under what terms. So, you know, what's the interest rate? Uh, any other conditions that they might have to the lending? Um, and [00:06:00] we. I want you to be really careful when you're speaking to different lenders, because they all have completely different processes is, uh, Lindsay knows very well, and hopefully we can get Lindsay to come on and talk specifically about this at 1 point, because they have a ton of experience talking to lenders have spoken to 7, um, but you want to make sure that when you're speaking to him, you double check if they're going to pull your credit or not.

So, as you go through the process and talk to them, they might have you sign a document. And you want to check like, Hey, can we get a term sheet before you pull credit? Like, can we just talk about, you know, terms because some lenders will run straight to, um, a commitment letter, which is basically they pulled your credit and they're like, okay, here's the thing that you need to sign to actually get the loan and some lenders are very quick to do this.

Others have a whole process. That they go through before that. So just make sure you're having that conversation with every single lender. Like, please don't pull my credit until we've [00:07:00] talked about it, um, until you're ready to sign a commitment letter, which means I have chosen you as my bank to move forward with on this loan.

Often you can, you can, uh, offer that you'll send a credit report to them. You can get that free credit report or free annual credit report and pull your own credit report to send along to them so that they can see that. Um, and we recommend that you get 2 to 3 term sheets, um, because banks all have different ways that they lend.

They have different risk profiles. They have different things that they look for in the people that they lend to, um. So you want to get different term sheets, but you don't want the lenders to know that you're shopping around. So it's really important to maintain your relationship with them because a lot of them do a lot of work.

You all know, Wendy, like, she spends a lot of time, like, actually running it past their credit team and underwriting before she puts a deal forward. Lenders can feel [00:08:00] like they've invested a lot of time and energy into you. And if you're just shopping around, they're like, why am I even bothering? So you want to handle this process sensitively.

Um, and when you're ready to, uh, talk to lenders, you can ask us for introductions. We have a whole bunch of lenders that understand us, our process, um, you know, we'll treat our fees as part of equity injection. So. Um, we are happy to make those introductions. If you have a lender that you want to talk to, then it's really important that you interview them and, and ask them a lot of questions.

Because just about any bank can do an SBA loan, but not every bank can actually complete an SBA loan. So there's all different Types of people that have experience with this preferred SBA lenders don't have to go to the SBA for sign off on a deal. They can make their own determinations. And there's a list of banks like Live Oak, [00:09:00] uh, that are preferred lenders and that have a ton of experience with these types of things.

But because it is a government backed loan, there's a whole bunch of conditions and things that need to be met. So if you're speaking to your local community bank, and they don't have actual experience of closing a high volume of these deals, then often what can happen is you get tied up with them and run down for months and months, and they end up not being able to get approval anyway, so.

Um, then when you're ready to move forward with the lender, you'll sign a commitment letter. So that's basically, you know, a formal agreement that triggers moving forward with a deal. Uh, you only want to sign 1 of these, right? Because that's that's actually going through the process of the loan process.

Uh, you don't wanna do this with multiple people. Um, so the action item at this stage is you want to make sure that you can get financing on your deal, ideally two to three different term sheets. And we recommend doing this immediately after LOI one, to be able to [00:10:00] give the seller confidence that you can finance the deal.

And two, the lenders are likely going to spot things that could be deal breakers, uh, before you actually, you know, pay for a QV and that sort of thing. So, you can make sure that there's some confidence in being able to lend on this deal at the structure that you have before you start paying, you know, your lawyers for due diligence and writing up the APA and before you start paying for a QV report.

So, that's why we like to see.

Um, so I'm going to be able to get lending at the structure on this business, and then that warrants you spending money moving forward on the due diligence. Um, so. Then on top of that, once you get under L. O. I. We highly recommend you set up weekly meetings with your seller. Just a set time every week that you meet with them to keep your deal on track because there's [00:11:00] so many things that you're going to need on both sides updates.

It gives confidence. Uh, it's accountability for progress. So if you're asking the seller for. Like, hey, I need your, your updated P and L's, you know, or I need your tax returns. I need your tax return. So if they keep showing up every week, right, it's hard for them to know that I have that set meeting and I can't turn up with anything equally for you.

It's accountability for you to keep the deal done. We have seen folks that. Um, don't keep an eye on this and end up not realizing how long that that they've been taking after to close a deal and the deal just loses momentum and falls apart. So, on those weekly meetings, too, it's cool because you have a set time.

So, if you need to bring in. Your QV or your lawyers, or, you know, from the cell side, additionally, you can just invite them to those meetings. And then, you know, you have a set time that you can recommend for everybody and it's, it's just [00:12:00] having that consistency in that same time every week reduces the likelihood of you pushing the meetings or missing them.

So. Um, you know, ideally it's an in person meeting. If that's difficult, then a zoom call is a really great way to keep that momentum going, but, um, it's a really awesome way to just keep things on track. If there's a broker involved, you can invite them to that too. So depending on the involvement of the brokers, uh, some want to be across absolutely everything.

Some once the LOI is signed that they don't really care, then they just kind of leave you to it, which can be to your advantage too, because then you're developing an even better relationship with this seller. Um, so once you've done all this, you want to, if you haven't already, you want to sign with your legal team.

Uh, we love Barlow Williams. You all have met them. Uh, they're the ones that have created the LOI template that a lot of you are using. Um, but in any case, whoever you use, please choose someone that has a lot of experience with SBA backed small [00:13:00] business deals, like the local, You know, friend that has done 100 million dollar transactions isn't necessarily going to write an agreement or go through this process in a way that's that makes the SBA happy.

So remember, the SBA is going to be across all of your documentation. Their lawyer is going to review everything and have edits for it. So if on your side, you don't have somebody that has experience with that, it can hold things up and, you know, unnecessarily run up your, your legal bill. You also want to engage a quality of earnings provider.

We love Chris. He does a really great job, has done this back and forth. We have other folks that we can recommend if you want to have several people to talk to, but please do not skip the quality of earnings. I think this is probably the best 15 to 20k that you will spend to actually verify. All of the financials in the business and help you determine things like networking, capital, maintenance, capex, forecasting going forward.

[00:14:00] Uh, and it really helps you in the negotiation with the sellers to like, if there's big adjustments that are going to need to be made as a result of this document, you can refer to the report that was done rather than you just arguing directly with the seller. Um, you'll also want to find yourself a corporate real estate advisor.

If there is property involved in this, um, you're either going to have to deal with the, uh, landlord of the business if you're leasing it, and there's going to be some things that you're going to need to do, uh, in the lease agreements and stuff to make the SBA happy, happy if you're using SBA. Um, if you're going to be purchasing the business, you absolutely want to have somebody that understands real estate and you want to value those separately.

Um, you also want to make sure that you have a tax advisor involved in this process, because depending on the structure that you put forward, there is going to be some pretty large tax implications for you as part of this process. [00:15:00] And after you purchase the business. And it will inform the kind of entities that you set up.

If you're doing a stock sale versus an asset sale, there's going to be different considerations. So you don't want to be blindsided with that after the process. You want to understand what that's going to look like. We also recommend engaging an insurance due diligence provider. Um, this service is usually free of charge.

So y'all are going to meet Andy on Thursday. He and his partner. That's all they do is search or deals. They do insurance due diligence and it's really cool because it can have a pretty big impact on the bottom line and also making sure that you're covered so you don't realize it. But the insurance side of things can be a big gotcha as part of this process, especially if they have, like, Okay.

Workman's comp claims that haven't been claimed yet, or if they have not had enough coverage, et cetera. So it can actually make big changes to your S. D. E. um, through that process. Uh, and [00:16:00] then if there's a lot of equipment or inventory, you're going to want to think about doing, you know. Equipment or inventory appraisals as part of this process, too.

So that's kind of the order in which we recommend you doing it. Um, you know, have the legal team ready to go. But really, after you get the term sheets, then the next thing is, oh, here we go. Do do do do start with the lender first and financial diligence first. So once you've got the term sheets, that's when you're going to want to order the QV and see if there's any big issues there.

Uh, then once you've got the QV and you're happy with that report, um, then that's where you're going to start getting into overdrive on the legal, getting the asset purchase agreements, uh, drawn up the insurance, looking at the real estate, the appraisals, that sort of thing. So if you do it in this order.

Then it can save you money because the 1st thing is the lender [00:17:00] requirements. And if you're not able to get lending on this deal, or if they have, like, really big issues with the appraisal or the structure, then you may need to have a, you know, negotiation. Before you even get into everything, or it might just be a deal that you feel like is not worth walking forward on.

Uh, then the financial diligence is really where you're going to get them to rebuild the financials to see if what they said was there was what was actually there. Some other things that we really love to see you do is like spend a day in the business, go in secret shop if you can, if they don't want you meeting the employees, but you don't want to buy something you haven't spent any time on, you definitely want to like, try to get to know it in some way and then also get industry specific expertise.

So, if you can find someone that can advise you or knows the industry that you're going to be purchasing it in some way to at least get them to look at the deal or be able to interview them. So that you're not [00:18:00] walking into this without any industry specific expertise on your side. Um, and then the last thing is, is just there is a difference between deal killers and deal adjustments and deal killers are, you know, fraud, major misrepresentations, not being able to secure financing.

Serious legal or regulatory issues. Everything else is probably going to be a deal adjustment. And those things are things that you can note down and then as you, uh, start to collect all of the adjustments that you're going to need to make https: otter. ai

These points as they come up is that you track all the adjustments, you keep a list of all the things like we're going to have to adjust this. We're going to have to adjust this. We're going to have to adjust this [00:19:00] and then you plan a discussion with the seller to go through all of those points and you prioritize the things that are like.

Non negotiables for you versus where you can be flexible. And that's something you definitely want to talk about us, right? Like, we're really good at this strategy. We're really good at looking at all of those adjustments and being like, well, actually, you really need this to happen. And this thing over here is a nice to have.

It's not going to be a huge impact on the business. And then once you've got your strategy together with all of those adjustments, then we recommend you go and do this in person because in person, every time you have a crunchy conversation is going to make things so much better, especially if you've developed a really good relationship with the seller by this point, that's why we like those weekly meetings because you're getting to know them, you know, and by the time you get to this point, if you've done it well, if you've built the relationship, well, if you have a good strategy going in it, then it should just be kind of finalizing.

Thanks everyone. All the little points that need to [00:20:00] go into the asset purchase agreement. So then when they get that purchase agreement, there's no surprises in there. There's not things that are points of contention. You've had all these discussions, you know, where there needs to be adjustments when you do this in person.

And explain the context behind why those adjustments need to be made, then you can get the buy in rather than it seeming like you're making, you know, adjustments for no reason. Um, so then once you've got all those adjustments agreed, then your, uh, attorneys will be drafting that purchase agreement going back and forth.

And also the SBA is going to be heavily involved at this point, making sure that they're happy with everything in that agreement too. Um, and you're able to kind of finalize the process as you get through that. So, um, that was a whistle stop run through. So I recommend that everybody read this in detail.

Um, but the important part is to, you know, involve us in that process. Don't [00:21:00] feel like you're alone in it. Uh, if you're ever unsure, just, you can pause, ask a question, get some information there, um, and then try to set up a meeting regularly with your seller and, you know, the seller's representations if they're involved so that you're keeping that progress ticking along while developing the relationship.

So, um, that was a lot all at once. But does anyone have any questions, or Lindsey, you've been through this a couple times, any, anything to add on top of that, that's a glaring gotcha or need to know as part of this process?

**Lindsay:** I, I thought that was great. I'm trying to think back to, you know, what, what did I wish I'd known that I know now? And if you covered a lot of the points, I think the only thing I didn't hear about was [00:22:00] what you can and can't control, uh, is important to remember. And I'm dealing with an issue now that will totally be resolved because of the rapport that we built with the seller, but the seller on our first deal refused to get an attorney until we had pretty much negotiated everything.

Um, and that's now coming back to, to bite them a little bit. Um, and it's like one of those things where it's a balancing act between like, definitely cover yourself. Be explicit about what you want, talk through things in person, you know, we tried to encourage them, for example, to, you know, you should, you should really go do this and some of these sellers are just, they're older, they, they, they've, they're not thinking about how to protect themselves in this transaction the way that we're, we're being taught, um, but it is so important because if you do everything that, that, you know, you just walked through.[00:23:00] 

You, you can't cover from from what the seller did or did not do on their end. Um, I think that's the only thing going back that I would have done differently of, like, I'd really like you to review this with your attorney before we say this is final. Because it causes hiccups later, like, making sure that everything is above board clear.

You know, your, your. Both equally pleased about the, the deal terms that, that you decided on. Um, I wish I'd done that better on the first deal and, and I learned from it and did it better on the second. Um, there was no question about any of, of the things from the first one because of that experience. So I think that's, that's one thing that you wouldn't think you need to, but, but depending on who your seller is, it would make sure that.

They either have something lined up or start talking to them and training them about lining that up. Really, the broker should do that. [00:24:00] Not all brokers are created equal. Um, so sometimes you kind of have to make sure that looking out for themselves is also you looking out for the deal. 

**Athena:** That's a really great point, Lindsay.

And we actually have quite a few folks that are that are working on off market deals right now. So there's no seller representation in it. So, you know, we, we've definitely fed that point along like, Hey, you guys get great attorneys, right? Like if you use Barlow Williams, but also it is to everyone's benefit to have lawyers that, that know how these deals go on the other side of the table.

So if your seller does not have representation, it's something that Ryan talks to them about, but when you're dealing with them directly, Like, lawyers can't represent both parties, right? So if, if, if they don't know anyone be like, Hey, we know really great people that do this and that [00:25:00] can protect you through the process.

And they're going to be separate. They have nothing to do with me. They have to advise you legally, like in your best interest, but having attorneys and advisors to the seller. That that have been through these deals and can advise them. Well, it feels good. A and B. It actually makes the whole process go a lot better as Lindsay rightly pointed out.

So, especially for those of you on the off market deals, if the sellers refusing to get a lawyer, like, just keep keep pushing it. Right? Like, no, you need to have someone involved in this process. Also, the other big gotcha on the cell side is like their tax. Situation. So a lot of them don't fully understand what their tax situation is going to be.

After, um, the purchase. And if, if their advisors are not making them aware of that, you probably want to like coax them to speak to someone. So they understand because [00:26:00] that we see that make deals fall apart all the time, you know, the, the fact that they don't understand that there's going to be a humongous tax bill after the fact, or that they're going to have to pay, you know, broker fees and tax bill after the fact.

Um, I was at an event here last week, and there was a another QV provider and he was talking about networking capital. And he's like, we know we've gotten the networking capital number, right? When both sides are a little disappointed.

That's the other big 1 that we talk about a lot is the networking capital. Number right? 

**Lindsay:** So hard networking capital Thorn in my side with both deals. Uh, we handled it better on the second one than the first um, but it it took like several weeks of like working with the seller and like explaining what its purpose is [00:27:00] and Multiple accountants got brought in and and like that's also because that deal that that business he really hadn't been keeping his books the way that Like I might have or someone else might have.

And so when it came time to run that calculation, it was like, oh, well, none of that actually exists in my system because I don't enter accounts receivables. And so effectively, when you run that calculation, the way it's typically described, it doesn't make any sense, but that's not an accurate representation of what is actually happening in the business.

And so getting that right before the deal closes. It's just so important. Um, because you can get screwed later if you don't, um, he would have been able to keep everything had we not done that exercise and that would have landed me in a very difficult position. So. Networking capital is [00:28:00] tough. It's really tough.

Um, 

**Joe:** just better to have it early and often. I'm imagining, like, just educating them on what it is and just, 

**Athena:** you know, ideally, by the time it closes, like, everybody understands deeply what it is and what it's for, you know, you would hope. 

**Lindsay:** Yes, but if you don't hire an attorney in time to explain to you the ramifications of that number, you know, it can get it can get hairy to untangle it later.

**Joe:** Yeah, 

**Lindsay:** maybe, maybe another time we'll get into the, all of that. 

**Athena:** I would love to. Yeah, I actually sent you a message today. I don't know if you saw it, but I want to bring Lindsay back and do a spotlight, particularly on the, the lending process because y'all went through quite a extraordinary journey with all of that.

Um, but in terms of post process, um, [00:29:00] and going through the process, you all actually ended up I know you did the weekly meetings with. Did you do that with seller number two? Was that useful to go through that process? 

**Lindsay:** We did. Yeah. 

**Athena:** Yeah. 

**Lindsay:** Weekly meeting, um, broker joined that one every week, actually. Um, that was not the case always with the first one, but yeah, it's helpful and it keeps it moving.

And, and sometimes it's like. The update is that there is no update is still better than nothing. Um, so I would definitely recommend that. 

**Athena:** Well, any advice for folks on how to use us throughout the process to and where to bring us in or get our thoughts as you go through it? 

**Lindsay:** I think you already said it. I mean, don't like, as things come up that you weren't expecting, you know, bring it.

We brought it to you guys and we would kind of workshop. How do we solve this? How do we. How do we take a different perspective at this? How do we make [00:30:00] this work for us? Um, that was really, really helpful for us because at that point you're so bogged down with dealing with the lenders It makes it really easy to be like, oh, well, I guess this isn't gonna work anymore and having a different perspective to Um talk you back into it.

Uh, if it's the right call, you know, it's not a huge red flag. It is really powerful We didn't have a ton of those but there were a couple of places I think on both deals that we got a little stuck So you guys were really helpful with that. Um, but yeah, the, the back and forth with the lenders is very Very distracting, um, it can make it hard to continue to, like, take care of the broker and take care of the seller when you're going through that.

**Athena:** Right? Um, and you guys use the checklist too. So I didn't actually pull that up, but that was [00:31:00] pretty helpful for you to keep everything organized. So, um, any, any thoughts on that and using that with. Throughout the process. 

**Lindsay:** Yeah, it was really helpful. Um,

I think taking a sweep through it with your deal team First it is helpful Because there's a there's a lot more in there than might actually relate to your business So you got to go through and like delete the stuff You also have to get a feel for if the seller is going to be savvy enough to actually upload things To wherever you're storing information, um, I looking back on the 1st deal.

I wish I I'd handled some more of that myself or or at least use that as part of my weeklies because sometimes documents would just get [00:32:00] lost because they failed to upload it properly. Or they failed to share it. Um, yeah, it was helpful though. I, and I think both deals we ended up using a version of a checklist.

**Athena:** Cool, I'm going to actually pull that up because I didn't talk through that, but just so you all know this DD tracker template here. Um, spent hours and hours on this thing, so I'm going to pull it up, but you're able to make a copy. And it's intended to be like a master or diligence list. So the intention here is that once you've got your deal team identified.

Um, you know, who's doing your QV, your legal insurance, et cetera, that before you send this list over to the seller, you go through this with the folks because a lot of this isn't necessarily going to apply to your business. So, we wanted you to have this kind of, like, master list of everything that might [00:33:00] be asked for, and then you go through and choose the things that work for you.

Um, and, you know, tech savvy sellers will understand the kind of naming conventions. You're able to kind of prioritize and then check who on your deal team actually needs this and give them access to it and keep everything organized in 1 place. Um, you know, but some sellers might not be. As savvy, so I think what Lindsay did and sometimes what we recommend is that if you're having a hard time getting all of this stuff off the cellar, then just set a time that you go into their office with them and sit there for a couple hours and kind of be there with them to talk them through like, okay, and now we need this.

And now we need this and bring a thumb drive or have them do it, you know, and it's. Yes, it's more time and maybe a little bit more laborious, but you're likely to get everything you need by just sitting down and asking them for it all rather than trying to communicate, you know, electronically and [00:34:00] asking, asking them to upload it and that sort of thing.

So, um, I think you ended up doing that with 1, if not both. Right? Lindsay with 

**Lindsay:** the 1st 1. Yes. Um, we had an in person visit, talk through some things and also just. Ask them again for some files that we're still missing. Yeah, for sure. So, um, I think also when you're going through this too, it can get really easy to be like, okay, it's the checklist.

Um, 60 percent there, keep going. I wish on our first deal I'd actually gone through here and reviewed some of the things that had, you know, additional comments from the seller. You know, there was some stuff about customer concentration that came out that looking back on it, it's like, okay, I know, I know what that means now.

At the time, again, this is, this is about like dealing with the lending process and [00:35:00] getting that over the finish line. It can get very distracting, um, but don't continue to have that, like, in depth conversation about what does this mean when you say X, Y, or Z, you know, you kind of. It can get easy to dismiss it and just say, okay, I've got it, but, but digging into that, um, I wish I'd done a little bit more.

I wish I'd really taken the time to understand it better. Um, because once, you know, once you have it and you've bought it, they disclosed it to you. So it's, it's really important to go back and make sure you've done your own personal due diligence to make sure that you know what you just received. Um, not talking like any huge.

Issues or flags, but a lot of the operations of how the business works comes out in that process. 

**Athena:** Yeah, and, [00:36:00] you know, you're learning to skill sets all at once. You're learning how to buy a business and become a business owner. So it's a lot. But the more you can try to understand what they're sending over to you, and the diligence documents and that sort of thing, the better prepped you're going to be when you take over the business, because you, you understand it probably on a more deeper level than the owner might even themselves, you know, so it's, it's kind of cool because you get to look at it through the lens of investment and lending and what they're looking at as risk and then being aware of that risk when you take it over and hopefully put some protections in place For the downside of that, you know, like, we were able to do that with your customer concentration where we were able to de risk it for you.

Um, and and get lending and also get the seller bought into making sure that that wasn't an issue post close. Right? So. Um, when you, when you understand it, you're able to kind of protect yourself a little bit better and walk in a little bit more eyes wide open. Awesome. Thanks. Lindsay. It just like, kind of spotlighted.

You didn't know you're going to be here, but [00:37:00] always always good to like, um, hopefully she'll agree to come and spend a whole hour with us where I can interview her and and y'all can hear their process because they've been, uh, really incredibly awesome. Methodical and thoughtful and resilient through this process.

It's not been easy at all. Um, but that's really what it takes. It takes a lot of hard work and tenacity and and bobbing and weaving. Right? Because you're going to get a million nose throughout this process. So it's it's like, oh, that's not a no. It's just like, okay, how do we make it? Yes. How do we get past this?

How do we do this? How do we do that? So, um, they were incredibly resilient and, uh, Reactive in a, in a great way throughout the process. So I'm really excited for you guys. I'm happy 

**Lindsay:** to help. If you have anybody has specific questions or things have come up on other deals that you want me to answer, I can definitely pull on our experience and.

And [00:38:00] talk with the group. It was a lot. 

**Athena:** It was a lot. 

**Joe:** Thank you. Um, does anyone have any questions about 

**Athena:** anything Lindsey touched on or post LOI process that we can clarify while we're here before we dive into some specific deal chat?

**Joe:** Doesn't sound like it. Cool. Um, thank you so much, Lindsay. Joe, are you still around? Did you want to chat through? I know you got some active stuff happening right now.

Hey, y'all. Um, I do and realizing my car is in the shop and I have about 10 minutes to go get it. And I was, I was hoping if I was going to go be earlier in the chat, but I can do, I can talk about it pretty quick. Cool. If that's anything helpful. Yeah, if it would be helpful to you to talk through it too.

We want to support you. [00:39:00] Yeah, I'm just gonna have to be quick. I do have to get my car by five here, and it's the same one that we talked about last week. Uh, so trying to accelerate the notes on it. Ultimately, I was about to, we were putting together, Ryan and I were putting together, uh, final numbers from the model and.

An L. O. I. For the A. C. Company that was showing, you know, healthy numbers. Um, he had come back to us, kind of made a stride asking for a higher asking price after he did a little bit of his own internal research. So we found based on the modeling that we could get to his kind of the lower end of the.

Range that he was looking for. He does not have an appetite for much of a seller's note. He wanted to minimize that. And I did have a chance to meet with him in person last Thursday for kind of a breakfast meeting. We sat down for about two hours. Uh, talking over obviously a lot of things I also, it also gave me an opportunity to go over a lot of [00:40:00] the key just topics of the, uh, letter of intent.

So nothing was a surprise to him, brought up the working capital, just again, the topic and that sort of thing learned a little bit more about how, how and when he gets paid, um, more about the employees, the culture, that sort of thing. So I had a good feeling leaving that meeting. So that was Thursday. I get with, uh, Ryan, I think it was.

If it wasn't Thursday, it was Friday, and it was, Ryan happened to think of it. He says, Joe, get with the owner because the P& L, the latest P& L that we have, even though it says for the entire year of 2024. The owner got it to Ryan probably a few weeks left in the, uh, in December. So it wasn't finalized.

Let's say so. Okay. No problem. I'll get that over the weekend from the owner. Uh, I requested it and I get it on Saturday or Sunday from the owner and I look at it and the numbers are quite different. [00:41:00] Substantially different. Um, rough numbers, his payroll expense went up about 25%. Uh, cost of goods went up a little bit and he only showed a little bit of actually the same amount of increase in revenue to offset those costs, the goods.

So ultimately when you, you're looking at an EBITDA, which was looking at 780, 000 is now looking at 580, 000. All because, well, we asked for the most updated PNL. So I don't know if anything was necessarily, uh, intentional and that sort of thing. And then it turns out the next day after the owner sends me the PNL, he gives me even another one.

Um, which didn't really change the numbers much. But one thing that concerned me, he didn't answer my questions. And I just asked, Hey, what was the reason for some of these increases? He didn't necessarily answer them on email. Um, so earlier this morning, I asked him for a few minutes [00:42:00] on the phone call. Uh, he and I spoke and, uh, other than him saying, yeah, these are what the final numbers are and what the bookkeeper's reconciling things on.

These are my final numbers, Joe. And I said, Hey, please, please, uh, uh, tell me a hundred with a hundred percent confidence is, are any of these increases, especially in payroll or the officer wage line that, that he shows himself. Were any of these additional ad backs to help me on the discretionary earning that I can be calculating?

And, uh, he said no. So what was what I thought a unicorn deal turned into a really good deal is now, it's there. Um, it's, I'm going to be struggling, I think, to get to his minimum range. I'll probably get a letter of intent to his minimum range and see what comes out in the wash in due diligence. Um, going to the lenders and see what they lend on.

Yeah. So that's the [00:43:00] long of it. 

**Athena:** I would, it's, it's a really good lesson for everybody. Right? So, uh, it doesn't sound. So, normally payrolls run at, like, the end of the month. Right? So, if you got a P and L at the beginning of the month, then it's probably a whole bunch of payments that went out the end of the month.

Also, something to pay attention to is end of year because of taxes and stuff like that. It is normal for an owner to make, uh, you know, capital expenditures or to purchase things or to do things to lower their tax liability when they have an idea of, like, how their year is shaping up. Um, so you want to get a full year.

Uh, financials, or if you're like, at the beginning of the month, make sure you catch up to the end of the month. Um, but also what you're going to want to do, Joe, I, I think, you know, as long as a deal still makes sense, just remodeling it and making sure that, you know, your numbers aren't seriously affected and maybe it's like, [00:44:00] adjusting the price down to get into, uh, L.

Y. But also what you're going to want to do, and what you're going to have to do as part of the lending processes is, uh, he's going to have to file 24 taxes and there are often going to be adjustments to the P and L as part of that process. And that's normal. It's it's not fraud or anything. It's just like.

Most people don't actually look at last year's books until middle of the year towards October, whatever, when they need to file their taxes, and then they actually have to go through everything with a fine tooth comb and update that and that sort of thing. So, really what the tax return means is that the P& L for the previous year is now solidified.

So, it's not, it's not a deal breaker if the P& L changes again, but what you're going to need in order to get lending is. Is those tax returns from last year, and then the P and L's from that, and then you might have to adjust the purchase price based on where those come out. So, uh, [00:45:00] just didn't want you to think that there's anything like, not normal going.

It's normal for owners to do that because, you know, doing the books and the tax returns and everything, it's a whole process. And it's, it's crazy. So it's normal that these aren't on top of it up until, like, the very last 2nd of the year. It is a shame that it was a big story. Swing down, but that can be to your advantage.

And, you know, Lindsay can certainly attest to this. And a lot of folks can, they might not be open to a seller note initially, but when they start to understand the reality of their situation, and then a seller note could give them a better, better, you know, outcome. Then, and as you develop that rapport in that relationship, it's always something that you could, you could revisit down the line.

So whatever the LOI ends up being You you can adjust that and change that or add it back in 

**Joe:** Right. Well, let me ask you a quick question. What's what's the harm from let's say meeting is the very very low range of what? He asked for despite the decrease, right? Uh, the debt service is looking at a one like a [00:46:00] mid 1.

3 So it's lower than I want, and that's even after adjusting my salary and benefits for me down. I'm not meeting my goal necessarily of what I wanted to be earning between, or more or less for discretionary earnings. But, if I go through, at least go through the process, see what I can get lent, use it to my advantage, bring the price down, make him get the feeling that, hey, he's already, you know, under the letter and going into the process, and he knows, he knows the decrease.

That's substantial. So he knows that the price is going to have to come down. I could say, Hey, I gave it a fair shot. Or should I? Intentionally and based on our model, not get to his range, 

**Athena:** it's on how you feel the relationship is going. I mean, it's an off market opportunity. So it's not competitive, which is to your advantage.

So you can either go back to him and be like, Hey, there was a big swing based on your payroll expenses. So I need to [00:47:00] adjust the purchase price down when I get a better understanding of, like, Okay. You know, the lending terms and your tax returns, we might be able to adjust it back up, but I, I have to make an adjustment based on all of these additional expenses that we weren't accounting for.

When we were looking at the model. That's 1 thing that you can do. And you can say, maybe I'll be able to get it up after after we get some finalized things, or you go in and his number, knowing that you might need to adjust down after you go through this whole process. 

**Joe:** So, and yeah, you do either or I, I, I'm almost taking the, the, the way of, Hey, let's just show him getting to his price again, remind him of the big decrease and Hey, I'm trying to get it through quote unquote, right through SBA and I'll see what that's like.

**Athena:** Yeah. I mean, if you're, if you're kind of seeding that, like, Hey. Uh, that was a big adjustment. I wasn't expecting and I was putting together my offer based on that. So I'll try to match that, but I'm just letting, you know, when I start having these lending [00:48:00] conversations, we might need to revisit how we're structuring this and what terms we're doing.

So, I think that's fine, you know, because then you can get a better sense from the lenders where they feel like it's at. I was hearing through Brian, but it sounds like he gets paid on site. So there's no like delay in payment or working capital kind of. Very 

**Joe:** slow. His longest, uh, longest he's out on any money is if it's a commercial, uh, job, which is a smaller, uh, minority share of his business anyways.

So it's working capital shouldn't be an issue. When it comes to, you know, AR and paid. Yeah, 

**Athena:** that's pretty good then. So, um, yeah, I think, I think you can play it either way because it's off market, but as long as you're, you know, telling him like, Hey, this might change. Cause you just changed like a big swing on then you're operating from a place of integrity and he knows that.

So, 

**Joe:** yep. And it was important to meet him in person, that sort of thing. Just so I see it, you know, how he talks, how he [00:49:00] handles what kind of guy he is. And, uh, Yeah, I can only chalk it up to if it truly was a surprise to him, it's just, that's a big swing. Uh, you know, and when you have emotion involved and excitement hurts a little bit, but, uh, keep going to court or stay in the course, see what happens.

**Athena:** Yeah. The first thing the lenders are going to ask for is 24 tax returns. So I'd get an idea from him, like, Hey, when do you think you're going to be able to get those? 

**Joe:** He said a handful of weeks, a few to a handful of weeks, he actually brought that up on the call with me. I said, you know, that's the holy grail.

That's the first thing they're going to be asking for. So he knows and he's, he's done SBA loans before too in acquiring business. So, but that was many years ago. I said a lot has changed since then, but he gets, he gets the process. 

**Athena:** Yeah, so then letting him know, like, hey, uh, we're going to need your tax returns.

I understand things might shift when you go through that process. So we'll just see where we land there. [00:50:00] Exactly. But that, that Hey, I want to jump off a 

**Joe:** video. I'm, I think you start getting an ACAR ticket. To get to my exciting 

**Athena:** Joe. It's not it's. Yeah, thank you. Get too upset and just expect that things are going to change against once he goes through his taxes.

So we're here for you. Keep us posted. No, we're good. 

**Joe:** Let me take the floor for a minute. Thanks. Of 

**Athena:** course. Yeah, always. Um, awesome. So that's exciting. Uh, anyone else have any questions or challenges? And then we only got a few more minutes, uh, on Thursday. Let me just start seeding that if anybody wants to raise their hand in the meantime.

Um, so insurance is not normally like a sexy or very exciting topic. But when it comes to buying a business, I think it's incredibly exciting and a really good 1 to understand. So most folks here have not run their own business. So you haven't had to deal with getting insurance policies as a business and that sort of thing.

So, Andy's going to come in on Thursday for buyers club. [00:51:00] And he's going to talk to you about overall, what kind of insurance should you be having on your business? And then when you're looking to buy a business, doing due diligence on the insurance that the current owner has, and making sure that they have appropriate policies, seeing if there's any things that might catch you out.

Like there's, there's workman comp claims that you might not have access. Access to yourself or even know where to look for, but they might be coming down the track. It might affect the rating, especially if you're using labor and that sort of thing. So what Andy's company does is specialize in helping people that are looking to acquire businesses in understanding the insurance landscape.

They do diligence. It's a free service that they do. So like. Absolutely want to do this as part of your deal team. Um, but what's really cool is that whatever they uncover can end up making quite big adjustments to the overall S. D. E. because there might be some pro forma adjustments that you need to [00:52:00] make to get the appropriate policies in place if the owner was, like, under covered so highly recommend you all come on Thursday.

That's going to be a great session. Uh, Andy's a lot of fun him and his partner, uh, are all over and really well known in this searcher space. So he's going to be doing a presentation to kind of demystify the whole insurance side of things. And then how it can be of benefit to you as you go through your business buying process.

So, uh, don't miss that one. We've got some other great stuff planned. So we'll be announcing some more, uh, sessions in the future. Um, but any other questions 

**Joe:** or things that you all want to chat through before we sign off for today? 

**Jason:** I'm here really late, but I have questions. 

**Joe:** Hey, Jason, congratulations. You got a signed.

**Jason:** Yeah, I mean, it feels like a baby step. Like a big step and then I like started talking to bankers. I was like, oh man, that [00:53:00] was just getting off the starting line here. 

**Joe:** Oh, yeah, there is so much. Yeah, I was 

**Jason:** like, I was so excited. Then I was like, oh man, this is This is like 1 percent of this entire process.

**Joe:** Yeah, Lindsay, Lindsay knows it 

**Lindsay:** well. I fully, I fully agree. Just keep climbing the mountain. 

**Jason:** That's kind of, it's like one step at a time. It's like, how do you like eat an elephant? 

**Joe:** Yeah. Um, 

**Athena:** so where can we help Jason or what, what part are you at? Or you just wanted to commiserate with, with the mountain that's ahead.

**Jason:** Uh, I want to commiserate a little bit, but you know, I did, I'm big on organization, right. That helps reduce stress. So I kind of went through the post LOI doc and did start getting my DD sheet together and then I, you know, just the seller I'm dealing [00:54:00] with, right. He's in his mid seventies. He's, he's going to look at that sheet.

And he's like, I don't even. Where do I even start? Right. So I'm gonna have to hold his hand. Like I've just accepted this. I'm going to have to get some ink in my printer because I haven't printed anything in like years and I have to print stuff and I'm gonna have to send it over to them and talking through it and, uh, I'm really just trying to understand the lending part.

Uh, especially with off market. There's a lot of information that obviously is. I would have had if there was a broker trying to understand what lenders want, what stages should we get to, you know, I know the post LOI said like term sheet, term sheet, term sheet. Like I get it. I've done it with real estate.

No difference between like commitment letter and term sheets. Um, so I really just, I feel like I'm under the gun with 60 days and I'm like, Hey, that's not a lot of time. 

**Athena:** Yeah. Um, so if what time [00:55:00] did you log on today? Just a few minutes ago, you said? 

**Jason:** Yeah, I missed the whole talk, but I'll catch it later. I usually yeah, 

**Athena:** watch, watch the recording because they go through the lending, you know, the whole post L.

O. I. process. Um, I know where you're at, because I'm catching up with the team. So. Ryan's going to make some intros for you, but, uh, really every lender has different things that they want to see. They have a different process and frustratingly and, and, uh, Lindsay, you can attest to this and hopefully I can convince her to come on and do a bigger deep dive.

So we can talk through this specifically, but, um, they're all going to want you to like, upload things in like, a million different formats and it's going to feel like you've done the same thing over and over and over again. Yeah. But there'll be some commonalities in terms of what they look for. Lindsay, can you remember for term sheets where they're like, I believe you said you had, like, a, just a pack of documents that you had ready to go that you [00:56:00] started uploading at that point.

**Lindsay:** Well, I wish I'd had a pack of documents ready to go, but because they kind of asked for the same information in different ways. Um, but, like. You know, it's always the tax returns, the panels, but then start, I would start a Q and a for yourself of, like, if you were a bank looking at those panels. Or tax returns for the 1st time, what jumped out at you 1st have that answer like, really polished.

Cleaned up like confident because they're all going to ask you and they're going to gauge your confidence in the answer of like whether they dig in or ask for more on that point or not. I figured out by like lender for that how much I feel like I know that red flag is that looks like a red flag, which really isn't a red flag as long as you have an answer and an explanation, they kind of are like, okay, okay, okay.

They want to see that you've done your homework more than anything else. [00:57:00] Um, I would just create a Q& A, like a document for yourself of all of that, and then you'll copy paste it and place it all the different places they're going to ask you for it. Saves you a lot of time. Um, some of them will have that conversation with you over the phone live, so if you have it up, you can just quickly jump to it, and then you have a record, too, of like, I've had this explanation with everyone.

Um, and as you get new questions from lenders, add it to your sheet. Someone else is going to ask it. 

**Athena:** That's a really great tip. Lindsay. I love the Q and a, um, let's get that added to the process too, because it is, you're going to be, you know, typing things out and rehashing it or explaining it and something that Lindsay said that I'll never forget, uh, was I've never had to defend.

Thanks. Something I've wanted to purchase before, right? Like, they, you [00:58:00] have to like, go in there and like defend your position to pay for something. You're trying to purchase this thing. So there's a whole bunch of selling yourself, selling why you are the person for it, getting them confident that you are going to be the person that they can entrust with a couple million dollars, you know.

So it's, it's not just answering the questions, but correct me if I'm wrong, Lindsay, they're also putting you under the microscope and how you're presenting yourself and answering those things too. 

**Lindsay:** Absolutely. It's who are you? Why are you a good fit for this business? And then tell me about the business.

And that can get into like, you know, what's the clientele like down to, you know, what's small, medium and large. Um, I don't know what kind of business you're, you're buying Jason, but any sort of revenue swings or profitability swings have that down. And if you don't know, go find out from the seller, um, have them explain that to you.

If you haven't already, um, [00:59:00] any big swings and cogs. Um, and then, um, you know, they're going to want to know, like, did you go to a vendor? Did you go to a different vendor? Did you change your prices? Like, what happened? Like, they're digging into that stuff at, like, the aggregate level. And if you get over that hurdle, a lot of the questions become a little bit more.

um, why this business? Why you? Um, so it's almost like an interview. It, it should feel that way. That's what they're doing. Um, I can dig up my q and a and, and maybe share it with you, Anka. Um, 

**Jason:** Ooh, that'd be great. Yeah, Ryan, a 

**Lindsay:** little, 

**Jason:** I was telling just Ryan, like dealing, being in software engineering and dealing with auditors.

It's like, you kind of got to convince them that you already know the answer, but they don't. They can't really question your response, right? It's just like [01:00:00] telling them enough information so the auditor can just check the box and move on. But you want to tell them the actual true story. 

**Athena:** Yeah, and they'll, they'll pull those documents too, and they'll have you pull them a million different ways.

Uh, so Jason, I'm not sure what time you logged on, but we were chatting about, uh, sometimes it can be really helpful to just go and sit with the owner to get all the documents that you need rather than sending it over to him, especially if he's not tech savvy. It's more time from you and it's kind of frustrating to watch a 7 year old navigate how to upload things.

But if you sit with them, get it all, you're more likely to get it when you need it as opposed to leaving it with them to to try to send it over. So, I think that's a good recommendation to, um, yeah, I plan to 

**Jason:** be there every Thursday afternoon. We set a standing meeting. He agrees. Right? I mean, if someone can't turn on video on zoom, like, you know, who you're dealing with.[01:01:00] 

**Lindsay:** Awesome. It's exciting. Yeah, 

**Jason:** I can see you, but you can't see me. How do I, how do I turn on my video?

**Joe:** Amazing. Cool. Well, um, so Jason, keep us posted to let us know how we can support Lindsay. I'm going to be following up with you. See if we can maybe 

**Athena:** spotlight you and just get a spotlight on the actual, uh, SBA lending process here on 1 of the buyer's clubs. I think it would be really awesome to walk through just kind of your experience if you're open to it at some point.

And thank you so much for joining and letting me pick on you since you've been twice. Yeah, 

**Lindsay:** anytime. 

**Athena:** Awesome. Well, thank you all. I love these sessions so much. I'm really excited. We got a lot of exciting movement with the clients and Lindsey. Congratulations again. I know you're almost exactly a month into business number 2 ownership.

So excited to hear how that's going. And we'll see you all here on Thursday for insurance due [01:02:00] diligence with Andy. So thank you all so much. Have a good rest of your day. Bye.
