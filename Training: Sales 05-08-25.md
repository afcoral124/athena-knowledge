0:00 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  Doing well, how are you?

0:01 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  I'm really good. Let me just shut my door really quick. I realized I left it open.

0:06 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  You're good. Your dog's gonna be pushing it open anyway.

0:10 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  I know, they'll be in here. They're fine. Sounds like you've had some good calls.

0:18 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  Some decent ones. I'm just worried about if we want to work with the other one. Um, he's got 200k liquid to like allocate towards us.  And then he's like also a real estate investor. So he's got like a couple of rental properties that he could liquidate.  And then he also does like hard money debt, uh, for real estate transactions. So he's got some like paper that he could potentially sell as well as like investors in his network.  I was like, look, man, if put a business in front you, that's two, five, but like meets all your criteria.  Something you're really excited about, like, are you able to come up with additional capital to, um, Facilitate that transaction, provided it's the right fit.  And he was like, well, yeah, I could sell something. They're bringing an investor, you know? So there's something there.  It's just a matter of, like, I think it's the flip of a coin in terms of, like, financing and structure, if it's something that he's comfortable with.  But I just told him, was like, dude, come back to me on Friday. We'll have another conversation and just see, like, what makes sense from a pricing perspective and, like, what helps de-risk this a little bit for you as well.

1:32 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Cool. So what do you say pricing in terms of, like, how to pay the 70K?

1:36 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  Like, he was just like, that's kind of, he was like, Austin, you would have told him, he was like, if you would have told me 30 grand, he's like, I'm dead right now.  And I was like, I think my internet's breaking up a little bit. Yeah, it was breaking up a little bit.  was like, dude, he was like, if you would have told me this was 30 grand, he's like, I'd move forward right now.  And I'm like, look, I'm like, SBA guidelines change. I'm We're still trying to calibrate to the new SBA guidelines and understand what allows us to be able to not lose money and be in a healthy position to do this, but also what makes sense for our clients from a structure perspective.  So I like, what if we did like 50 grand up front and then 20k to signed LOI? Like, is that something that would move the needle for me?  It's like, honestly, it's like, I just need to think about like, if this or like, like, if this makes sense, and I was like, kind of dug into that a little bit, which is like, okay, it sounds like it makes sense to move forward.  We're just working on like, how do we make this work from a financial perspective? So it's like, look, man, I'm like, I'm not guaranteeing that I can do this, whatever we come up with after we're off the ladder and get approval for anyways, but like, bring something to me on Friday that you would do, right?  Like, bring me whatever kind of structure you want, like something that makes sense for you. And then I'll run it up the ladder and see what we can get done.  But really, I'm going to try and negotiate. that and then run it up the ladder to you.

3:02 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah. Do me a favor, don't offer signed LOI as an option. Because then they're going to be afraid to sign an LOI.  Yeah, I hear that. So it's already scary enough for them. So adding a 20 pay or whatever, saying that they'd have to pay at signing LOI, it's going to hold them back from actually moving forward.  Yeah, I've been thinking about this, like, as long as they pay the 70k within six months, then I'm cool.  Right. So we could like, but basically, it's like, they really need to be in it for 12 months.

3:45 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  Right.

3:46 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  But it's six months is where they start losing their nerve. So if they've already paid at six months, they'll stay in it for another six months, because it's complimentary at that point.

3:56 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  Right. Mm hmm.

3:58 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So I think that's the guarantee. It's like, Mm Mm Look, we're pretty good at getting people under offer in six months if you do everything on your side.  So I always emphasize that, like, you're going to have to do all the work on your side to make that happen.

4:11 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  Yeah.

4:13 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  But if it takes longer than six months, we'll extend the service for up to six additional months.

4:21 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, that makes sense. That makes sense.

4:23 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Then they basically would have eight months, seven to eight months to pay the 70K at that point.

4:31 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  Yeah.

4:34 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Which, you know, like if they're signing up now, we're not starting them until July 1st, and then it will be six months of search from that point on.  So as long as they're paid up by the beginning of their six months of search, and like 30K up front really is what we need at a minimum.  So then you could potentially do like 30K up front and then 5K per month over eight months. For 35 now, and then five per month over the next seven months.

5:06 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, that's 30, that brings it to 65. If you do 35 up front, and then five months for seven months, then bring it up to 70.  Yeah, yeah, that makes sense. That makes sense. Yeah, I was just thinking about that. I'm like, that's the first person that's like, like, Augustine was never going to close, in my opinion, you know, from the first time we got on the phone with him.  then like, same thing with Devin, in my opinion, like, there's some things that I could have done better for sure.  But like, single job forever, thinking she's going to put an operator in place immediately, like, that just wasn't a great fit.  So it's like the first real opportunity. I was just like, I'm just shooting for the hit, man. Like, let's see, let's see what sticks at this point, you know?

5:55 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah. No, I mean, you know, like, the... And rather than say, we're trying to cover our costs or whatever, it would like structure it in their benefit.  Just be like, look, none of the other search services will even work with SBA because they do a percentage based on deal size.  We don't do that. So we're structuring it in a way that we can work with you while mitigating our risks because first time buyers, 98% of them aren't going to close.  So, you know, it's a huge risk for us to take you on because the likelihood is you're not going to close, you know, like put it back on them.  It's like, this is, this is, you know, so if you are genuinely bought in to buying a business, then this is, this is one of the best ways it's going to get you there because you're going to have a whole team of eight people for 14 months, you know, or seven people.  Like Nassam has a whole team in addition to all the things that our core team do.

7:00 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  I don't know how much David showed you about how he works with Masam. Yeah, he was giving me some insight in the sense of like, he'll send over data.  He's like, but they've got a whole team over there that's just like scraping every listing that they can possibly find forever, you know?

7:15 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, and researching business owners as well. So it's like they're like hand researching business owner contacts for us to reach out to and scraping and all the incoming deals.  So I think they're like on market, it's like tens of thousands a month that that team is processing, which is part of our team, you know?  Like we're processing that many for people to like get them matched. So, you know, it's like, well, how much do you think a team of seven people should cost for 14 months to run your search?

7:49 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, I hear that. I hear that.

7:52 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  But, you know, like if you break it down per person over 14 months, it's like.

7:59 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  Too great. 54, Yeah. Well, you're not a person is what I was thinking, but it's lower than that.

8:09 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  70,000 divided by 14 is 5,000 divided by seven. It's like about 700 bucks a month per person.

8:19 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  Yeah.

8:20 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  You know, sometimes like breaking it down, down, down, down, down. So they see the, like, you know, value of it.  And then like that gets wrapped up in the loan. So as long as you, you close on something with us, then you're essentially paying 10 grand a year for a business.  It's going to cashflow hundreds of thousands of dollars to you.

8:45 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  Yeah. That's a good point. Yeah. Yeah. I'm like, that's what I said. I'm like, I got, I was able to explain that a little.  So something else we need to talk about that came up today is, um, our event, like really restricts. Like, look, man, I'm like, we do start to match up.  Like, I just don't think that this is a good fit for you because, like, it sounds like you've had a decent job or done a decent job of, like, getting in front of deals.  Like, the issue is, like, the financing component, correct? And he was like, yeah. He's like, but he's, like, at the event in Houston, like, hearing Walker talk about ERP systems.  He's, like, really trying to constrain what he's looking at to, like, simply ERP implementation organizations or ERP consultancies. So I don't know if that's a good situation to refer out to somebody else within our network.  Now, I knew that that wasn't a good, good, good.

9:41 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah. Um, I might introduce you, like, well, overall, do you think he's, like, a good client for somebody else?  Because what I typically do is, like, if you think, like, this person's awesome, I'm going to do a friendly and make an introduction.  If you're not sure, so what I told, there's Andre and there's Dave. So Dave is, he'll work with previous business owners, do off-market only, but he wants people that have deal experience that are previous business owners, high likelihood to close, like doesn't want first-timers.  And he's backed up for  whatever.

10:22 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  Yeah.

10:26 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Andre wants people to be very specific on industry. He wants them to have related industry experience and, you know, be able to finance and close.

10:34 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  He usually works, you know, with like PE and stuff too.

10:38 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Like he will work with first-time buyers, but wants them to be like really dialed in. And, but he wants them to be very specific on their thesis.  So what I told Andre, I was like, if I make a personal introduction, I think they're potentially a great client for you.  If they come to you and say, I heard about you through, then just know that we didn't. Make a personal introduction for a reason, but I don't want to stop sending people your way.

11:05 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  That's cool.

11:06 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So if you're not sure, like, like, think about it. Like, if people send us badass people, then we're just, like, amazing, you know?  Like, and Andre sent people our way, too, because he's like, I don't work with first-time buyers that don't know what they want.  We don't have an official referral agreement in place. I don't really care, because I just like having someone to refer out if people are awesome and they're really specific.  And I'm like, and I can't vouch for him specifically, because I don't know anyone that's actually worked for him or worked on him.  So, like, I'll say that to people. I'll be like, you know, I've spoken on an event with this guy.  I got a really great vibe from him. You know, I've seen him around in the industry. I don't have any, like, personal anecdotes of, I don't know anyone personally that's worked with him.  But... He's someone you can check out. That's his website. So I just give them that rather than making an introduction.  And then at some point, if you want, I can make an introduction to him or you can just let me know.  Yeah. So I'll need to make an introduction at some point, but I would really like, what's that?

12:22 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  I said as needed, like when it comes up, right, like we can cross that bridge when we come to it.  But I think this is perfect for Arvin just because like, like he's got 300k personally, but like he's looking at like deals way larger than what he can afford.  And like, he has domain expertise, but like, I didn't necessarily get the warm and fuzzies talking to him and not that I'm like the end all be all in terms of judge of character.  You know what I'm saying? But like, I don't know if it were my connection, if I would be willing to make a personal introduction on his behalf either.

12:59 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah. So I'm I'm pretty discerning about who I make introductions to, right? So it sounds like you are too.  But, you know, I'll just tell people, like, if they come to you and said they heard about you through me, like, I also don't want to stop people from getting clients.  This independent sponsor conference that I just sent you, this is in Dallas for a year. I actually would like to go again because I made a lot of really great private debt investor connections there.  Myself. And this was right after my property management deal. And I was like, I'm going to be an independent sponsor.  And I went to this event and I came away with, like, great investment contacts. And then, like, I was in the middle of, like, starting searches for people, too.  But it was like, I'm doing that to fund my search. And then this turned into a business. So it was really funny.  But had a really great experience there, despite the organizers being total  . Thank you.

14:01 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  I met some great people.

14:03 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So if anybody is interested in the private plays and the bigger financing sources, you can just give them the link to that too.  Because I think even with people like that, if you give them a few resources, it's like, oh, they helped me out.

14:22 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  Because he's active in the EBIT communities and whatever. And sometimes the people that don't work with you end up being the biggest advocates for you.  Oh, he even said that today. like, oh, he's like, awesome. I really appreciate your guys' time. And I'd welcome, if you have information that you can send me, I'd welcome that.  He's like, but I know a bunch of searchers in this space that may be a better fit for what you guys are doing.  He's like, so I'll keep you in mind and send business your way. So that's more why I wanted to go out and connect him with the right people than like, I'm overly enthusiastic about art.

14:57 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah. And that's the way I do. Business, you know, it's like if you always leave everyone better than you found them, then the ROI on it's pretty high.  Crystal referred people to me even though she didn't become a client and seems to think very highly of us, you know.  I think it was a budget thing for her and I really liked her and like we had a pretty deep emotional connection, you know, during the sales calls and stuff like that.  So, but I also don't want to waste my contacts time by making direct introductions if I'm not sure about them.  So, yeah, so those are two resources that I give people. I'll send you Dave's now as well if somebody's like in the current business.

15:40 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  Crystal was like when I told her I was taking over sales for you and like you were like in the process of like being able to like transition out into a true executive role.  She's like, heck yeah. She's like, that's amazing. Like she's like, that girl needs to be working on her business, not in her business.

15:57 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  I'm like, she's so sweet. Um, okay. David Collinson is the other resource. We actually, we're, we've been trying to figure out a way to work together forever.  Like we, we collabed on a project at one point where I was trying to do consultancy for one of his clients doing off market.  And I was like, look, if we don't own the conversation from the beginning, it's really hard for me to course correct with somebody.  So I ended up like dropping that client. Um, and then he gets a shitload of leads off market. Um, so we're, we're analyzing if there's a way for us to use the ones that, that are excess from his client searches and stuff.  Um, he's highly efficient at getting off market leads. Um, but his deal sizes, it's like, can't be too big.  He's better on the like smaller deal sizes. So if somebody wants off market leads and like smaller deals, which is why he's saying existing business owners that are looking to do a roll-up strategy are probably good for him.

17:00 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  Yeah. Yeah. I'm like, I just don't think that's hard. I'm like finding, finding sub million dollar businesses that like want to sell off market.  I'm like, I was looking at David's process a little bit. so like, the messaging and stuff, I'm like, I'm just not to where I have the mental bandwidth, like hop in on that.  But like, to your point, I think long term, I'll be able to add a little value there.

17:25 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Oh, with our process?

17:26 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, the entire time about like the off market deal sourcing, that side of thing. I'm like, but David's like really with it.  I'm like, I really enjoyed me and David got along really well.

17:40 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  We just like Oh, sorry, I was talking about Dave Collinson for the deal sourcing.

17:48 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  I'm shifting gears.

17:49 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  I'm just like, oh, I gotcha.

17:51 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  Okay, you're talking about like, it's me confusing things. You're looking at me like my wife looks at me.

17:56 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  And she's like, where did we go? I got lost. Yeah, no, we're, I'm going through the process with the team, I think I might have shared this, like, I got them to map out everything about the off-market process, and I realized there's a lot of disconnects and a lot of, like, telephone things that happened when I handed it over, and just areas for us to, like, clean up and make it better, now that we have so much experience with it.  So we're doing deep dive sessions once a week with the Venn team, and it's, it's, we did the first one on Monday, and it's awesome.  Like, I'm, we're just going to blast the  out of the water. So I think by the time the, the new searches start, we'll be rolling.  Oh, yeah. Like, mean, we're already getting a lot of, like, off-market leads, but I think, you know, my vision is by the end of the year that we have at least as many off-market deals hitting clients as on-market.  It's a lofty goal, but I think, you know, putting all of those amazing minds together on their, you know, respective parts of where they're really good at it, and then connecting all the dots, and then, you know, ideally having you come in and give some magic to the, we're going to, next week, we're going to start going through all of the copy, all of the templates that we're using with Fathomarket sourcing.  Um, and I bet, you know, having your eyes open with that, you'd have some really great input for the team.  So, um, when you're ready.

19:37 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  I was talking to Ida, too, talking about, like, all of the great minds in terms of every segment of that process, and she's like, Austin, I don't know how you could be, like, do sales and be, like, talking to people every day.  Like, people are mean. And then she, like, shows me her job, and I was like, Ida, I would freaking, like, be in front of my computer crying every day if I had to do her job.  I'm like, like, I'm I'm Oh my goodness. I'm like, you give me way too much credit. I'm like, you do so much here.  Like, that is unbelievable.

20:08 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Like, Ida's like, it was so funny. I keep telling Anka, like, do you have any more family members that are like high background there?  Cause like, I was like, I claim you're first born. So like grow them quick, you know? But yeah, Ida, Ida is like, you know, chasing, chasing NDAs, getting SIMs, booking broker calls, chasing owners, like just one person, 100% dedicated to that is crazy.

20:40 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  I was like looking at her pipeline and I was like, oh my goodness, Ida. I'm like, I don't know.  I'm like, I literally could, I like, don't have the ability. It's not that I would just like dislike your job.

20:51 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  It's like, I literally don't have the ability to do your job. She remembers like every end. She signed too.  Cause like when it, when a write-up happens, she like, and she, did you, did she show you her calculation table that she started for how many NDAs each client needs to be able to get the write-up target?  And so like, she did that all on her own accord.

21:17 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  That's amazing.

21:18 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah. And she remembered, like when a write-up happened, she remembers the NDA and how hard it was to get that SIM, you know, or how hard it was to book that broker call.  It's, it's exceptional, you know? So like, not only do people have this whole team behind them, but they have a team that like, there's somebody on the team that gives a , whether an NDA has a SIM that matches it, like deeply gives a , you know?

21:44 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  It's like, who has that kind of follow through and accountability that like every NDA is trapped, you know, like I know exactly how many NDAs I need to sign to get you a write-up.  It's funny. I'm like, yeah, I, I was just like. And that's like her, like Luke, I was like, yeah, like, I kind of get more or less what you do.  And like, don't get me wrong like that, like, especially the what struck out to me about his job, like, the volume of sims that he's analyzing on a daily basis, like, that is like, you're just like, like, clicking through those very, very quickly, you know, and like being able to like pull out relevant information and be able to like, understand is this a viable candidate that's worth like digging into with a broker, you know.  Like, that's like the volume there is huge. And like, don't get me wrong, like, it sounds like he knows what he's doing in terms of like financial modeling and all that as well.  And like, I was asking him a little bit about like, hey, do you throw in macro stuff or like potential macro risks as well?  He's like, Oh, dude, let me let me send you over some of our like, our my write up videos.  He's like, I'll send you two that will really give you a good idea of that. I was like, Oh, that would be great.  But he's like, very pointed and like, intentional with how he talks. For sure you can tell.

23:01 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, he's a, have you seen write-up, like a full write-up?

23:06 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  Not until, yeah, I did. I did with Luke yesterday and then he sent me over a couple. So he sent me like the Loom video that goes with the write-up and then he sent me two write-ups that went with the Loom video.  So those are the first ones that I saw outside of like the little video, you know.

23:23 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, that's, that's what goes to like every client. So then they can dig in, they get to listen to the call, you know, like the call is transcribed, you know, so they like the ones that listen to the calls, they learn from that too, you know, and they get to pick up where we left off.  It's, I think it's, you know, nobody's doing on market, but like to be able to get that level of insight before you decide to move forward on the non-market is pretty cool too.

23:54 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  Or just like, like the, like said, the sheer volume of people that talk. Each deal and are like, yeah, this looks good because like David or like even before David gets to David, like Masam's team is going through and finding information.  And then David's like looking through that, validating that like it needs even a requirement or SDE requirements as well as industry requirements.  And then it gets passed to either that like goes and chases it down. And like, again, I'm sure that's another set of buys on it.  And then it gets onto Luke's calendar who then reviews the full SIM. And then like, if it's something that makes sense, actually has a conversation with that broker.  So it's like, you have a deal evaluated by four, five, six people before it ever gets put in front of you.  And then like, by the time it's in front of you, like the information that we're able to like distill through that process is like so granular that it's like, okay, here's the questions that they didn't have answers to that you need to like address prior to moving forward.  Like set up a call with the owner and then like you're prepped to make an LOI. It's like you're not having to go like in just like people don't know how to analyze opportunities, in my opinion, like especially like looking at potential risks or like licensing requirements, things of that nature, you know, where it's like all of that's like called out very clearly up front.  So it's like you can, within a matter of hours, really like could be like feel confident enough after looking at one of those write ups to like be submitting an LOI and moving into diligence, you know.

25:31 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  I want to show you a little thing one of our clients sent yesterday. So he's about to sign an LOI.  This client was terrified of financial modeling right into the modeling. He's negotiating working capital with the broker. Burger got kind of  with him, gave him some advice on how to get onto this call.  All to, like, finalize the LOI.

26:13 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  And that was the result. Is that, is he talking about the broker or the owner of the conversation?

26:18 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  The result was, he said, just, he said, hey, Athena, broker just called me and got off the phone with him.  He was very nice, very cordial. He explained his viewpoint. He said, listen, we're giving you 30 days of networking capital, but then we're also leaving all the AR that's under 90 days.  His theory is if it's over 90 days, it's work she did. She already gets paid for it. If it's less than 90 days, he'll leave it in the business.  And he did say, you know what? We'll come to some middle ground after your accounts go through things, after my accounts go through things.  So after QV, we'll be able to come to some middle ground about working capital. I think I agree with that saying what you said yesterday, that both parties will be a little bit.  Disappointed in that final number. So I think I'm going to accept the LOI as it is, except Bill's recommendation to leave it 30 days and renegotiate this if it needs to be renegotiated.  They were having a really crunchy pre-LOI conversation about working capital, and I gave him advice. I was like, hey, script it all out.  I don't think you were on the Buyer's Club, but it was on Buyer's Club. So it's like, script it all out, use GBT, like tell him your concerns.  And then, and he's like, and I was like, my tip is you got to compliment this guy and you got to break the shell because he's, he's having a shell with you right now.  And I was like, so what I typically do is like, hey, Mr. Broker, gosh, you must have such a tough job.  Like, I bet you've got hundreds of people just contacting you, kicking the tires and dah, dah, dah, dah. So Gil followed that advice.  then the guy being like friendly, and they had a really productive conversation about working capital that was like actually way better than I thought it was.

28:00 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  So now they're signing the LOI as a result of that.

28:04 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  these little, I mean, Justin was the one in Austin that he really liked. He had an offer for a roofing company that was about to accept an offer from private equity for $2 million more.  However, a came back to him yesterday and said, seller doesn't want to stay in the business for five years.

28:29 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  You're his favorite. He wants to figure out a way to make it work. That's super cool.

28:34 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Because we teach people things that it's about how to win. It's about the relationships. It's about negotiation. It's about the things that they don't realize are going to help them get the deal done.  It's not just the  how much it is and where it is and using big words at people, you know?

28:55 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  That's like counterproductive. I'm like, I'm, I think broker conversation. And they're like, tend to be very transactional, you know, and then like conversations with owners tend to be like very emotional.  And if you can like, just tap into that and understand that a little better, like, you have a way better shot at winning.  That's my tip.

29:13 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  You know how to make the broker like their advocate though, you know? And there's a different way that you do that than you do with the owners.  And , the only reason I was in that property management deal as long as I was is because I was the broker's therapist for like two hours a day.  He was like, tell me everything he hated about life, the world, whatever, whatever. He loved me, you know? But I know how to build relationships and I do things a little bit differently.  With Steve and Polly, they were in a competitive thing. Broker like cut out any more owner calls because the owner was getting overwhelmed.  She'd met Polly, she hadn't met Steve. So it was like, do a video and tell them about how important family is to you and dah, dah.  And I'll time. Bye. They didn't end up winning it because there was a more like, like price sometimes does win, but the broker was like, that was an excellent touch.  Owners loved it. Like, thank you so much for doing that. Like, who's telling people to do that? You know what I mean?  Like, more playing this game. So like M&A finance, blah, when actually like, you play it differently, do that pattern interrupt, like I do with everything, teach people how to do it.  And it feels better too. Like now he's got a good relationship with the broker.

30:32 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  Right. The, uh, yeah, I'm like, it's interesting, like how just like folks, especially like folks with a background in finance approach SMB, the SMB space, you know, like, like, I don't know if I would do that, but teach their own, you know?

30:53 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  What most people think, especially like, I. I. I. I. I like teaching people a way to do it authentic to them without making anyone think that they know more than they do, you know, and sometimes being vulnerable, but honest and confident, you know, it goes so far with people because brokers have worked with first time buyers before, right?  Owners understand, like, you're doing this for the first time because so are they. Okay. So what a lot of people do is they try to put it out like they know what they're doing and they start their search investment website and, you know, just like, oh God, like trying to look like an investor and .  I even did it too, but I put my personal story on mine. I talked about my parents and their business and my dad having a heart attack and not having enough money now in retirement because of that, because they shut their business down instead of selling it, you know, like it's very personal to me.  One of my why's is I want to earn enough money to be able to take care of my parents.

32:00 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  I don't right now, you know, so you're like, that's, that's something that gets you out of bed every morning, you know?

32:09 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah. And this team, this  team that cares so much that they're tracking every single NDA, you know, like, I, it does a lot of, it does a lot for me.  I get a lot of energy from, from the people we have and the client work that we do. even speaking to owners, like, it's, it's been really great to get back in things.  I had two, two quick things I wanted to talk to you about, and then I want to make sure we have enough time for contracts and the equity discussion.  So Kate's decided she's not cut out for this.

32:51 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  Oh, really?

32:52 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  She gave notice yesterday. Just an FYI, I'll be, I'll be the point of, your point of, like, always a, was your point of contact, but.

33:03 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  Honestly, Athena, hopefully, I just hope once we see, A, we've got Federico that I feel pretty good about, and if I could just find a way to make that work for both of us, I would be absolutely ecstatic, and then I'm running, there's a saying in the car business, who's the best salesman on the floor?  It's like the last person that sold a car, because they have all that confidence, you know? So if I could sell either Morgan on Monday, or early next week sometime, or Federico tomorrow, I'll be ecstatic and probably rolling, but that gave me, A, it was generally a better call, because I've been putting in the work in terms of just talking through that sales script every single day, you know what mean?  Like, I just, it was better executed, but, like, it was also the first person that, like, Like, I really had a chance to sell and that, like, didn't freak out and slap me around when I dropped the price, you know, for lack of a better expression.  So it's just, like, that, like, helped ease my nerves a little bit and, like, boost my confidence, which, like, more than half your battle in sales is just, like, the belief that you will be successful.

34:20 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah.

34:21 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  So I'm, like, hopefully I'll be doing great.

34:23 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  I mean, I loved your report yesterday, so don't ever apologize for monologues because I know we don't get a ton of time, so it's really helpful and, like, also helps me see where you're at.  And I can feel your energy, like, jumping off the screen, so, like, that's exciting to me. And honestly, like, I nearly bricked it.  I don't know, the first couple of months I was dropping 30K, and now I do it without even thinking.  So, like, this is our next level up. But, you know, with Morgan, I love him. I want him to see.  The client. So like, I really do. I think he'll be phenomenal. So I, he has enough to make it work and he's investable.  I actually know investors that specifically want to invest in that. So like if he needed, if he was open to like a little bit of an equity check or whatever, then I would make those interest based on what I've, and if he continues to show me the character that, that came through to me on that call, then he's somebody that like, if he needed a little bit of equity, if he was open to it, like there's people that want to support Vets.  There's lenders specifically that want to invest in Vets and they'll bend over backwards to make it happen. His heart just like is so in it for the right reasons to me that, you know, it seems like he has the financial capability.  Now. He wanted to go after something a little bit bigger. You know, he just needs to put in 5%.  If he was open to a little bit of investor equity, like he's investable, especially with an MBA from UT.

36:13 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  It's just like, on.

36:14 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So he, to me, is like a  yes. I haven't met Federico, but like I said, if you want to, like you're at liberty to figure out a payment plan, so long as it's not milestone based and they're paid by the, by the beginning of their six month of search.  So it'll be like seven to eight months. And we want to try to collect at least the 30K up front.

36:38 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  I don't think I'd go, I don't like, and honestly, like, I, like, I don't think I'll have to go below 30 grand ever on the front end.  Like I, and even like how you're saying, like dropping 30K, you felt like you bricked it. Like I haven't, it's not that I haven't been confident or like been able to defend that 70K, you know what I mean?  I it's like, it's just about when it's like, okay, when we, and like the other two, it's like, we don't, you don't really want to move forward with us, right?  So like, there were other issues, but like with Federico, it's like, okay, now we know you want to do this.  It's just a matter of like, figuring out how we're able to pay for this process, because like the 70k up front is too big of a bite for you.  And it's like, okay, I get that. Let's have that conversation. Um, so I'm, I'm pretty confident on the seven, like not a hundred percent, you know, like there's still, I think we're still going to have to negotiate that a little bit on the front end, which is fine.
  ACTION ITEM: Update contract/quote lang for 70K/30K split. Prep exact contract process for tmrw mtg - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/295285710?timestamp=2255.9999  But I'd rather hand up high and be able to negotiate it anyways. So I don't, I don't foresee that being a major issue.  But like, again, like, that was the third exploration call I ran, Athena. Okay.

37:46 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  I'm just realizing, I mean, I need to update our quote language or our service agreement language. For the 70 and the 30, but I'll show you how it works.  And then I'll, I've got some stuff I'm going to do this weekend. So I don't think you're going to be having anyone sign an agreement before this weekend, right?

38:07 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  Tomorrow afternoon, worst case, but I'm like, I would just push for another call with you. Can I look at your calendar, Athena, or is there not a way for me to do that?

38:20 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Wait, what happened? No. Let me go through Anka. Um, so let's see. We've got time tomorrow at 11. We've also got time.

38:38 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  Or do you want to run that call in morning?

38:39 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So that's what I was going to ask you. It's kind of like the overall vision mission, why we started, but I think you've heard that a lot.  Like most of it, you just haven't heard that necessarily behind the scenes. Um, so I can give you a video of me doing it in the past.

38:56 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, that's fine.

38:57 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Um, then we can have that time back and then that would give me. Some time in the morning to update the pipeline and get the quotes updated.

39:07 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  How about that? Yeah, I think that's beautiful. And if you don't get the pipeline updated, you know, don't worry about it.

39:13 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  I'm like done before Monday because I just watch. I'm like hyping, hyping, hyping, and we get like a drip from acquiring lines.

39:24 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  I can't imagine that would happen because like when Renan's episode dropped, there was no link.

39:29 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  There was no anything.

39:30 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  It was just like mentioning my name. So the, I, I've done, I'm like, I booked another meeting today from just like working the pipeline too.  So like, I'm not, when you say that again, I said nice work. Yeah. I was going to say it'll be helpful when you have that cleaned up.  Cause like, I don't mind working with a database. Like I've made a handful of calls today, sent out some emails.  I like, I like rather enjoy doing that to be honest with you. Like, obviously I'd rather be in like.  Back-to-back sales calls every day because, like, that's what gets me paid, you know, but, like, I don't mind doing follow-up or, like, outbound outreach.
  ACTION ITEM: Create new SearchFunder acct w/ AcquiMatch email - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/295285710?timestamp=2404.9999  It's not bad.

40:09 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay, cool. Have you gotten into, um, you're on SearchFunder, right?

40:15 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  I am, but I haven't logged in recently at all. So I might just create a new account with my AppleMatch email.  Okay, cool.

40:24 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Turn it over. Um, and then the EBIT WhatsApp group, I haven't been paying attention to that at all, but I talk to the organizers.  Sometimes they do, like, and ask me anything, and I was like, hey, if you ever need to talk about deal sourcing, and she was like, yeah, who are you again?  And I was like, okay, whatever. She's like, maybe in a couple months, because they asked Andre, and I was like, I just, I was on a panel with Andre, you know, and I'm like, I, I, I at SearchFund Coalition, like, that's all good.  Okay, you don't know who I am. Um, I don't, I don't. Try to, I've stopped doing that thing where I try to, like, protest my worth, you know, because I know word's going to get around eventually anyway.  This is not productive either. Well, yeah, it's interesting. There's a lot of searchers in there. I haven't, but typically what I do is I go in and add value or answer questions, which is how AirVend came to us.
  ACTION ITEM: Remove training from tmrw's schedule. Reach out to SBA via Matthias' email - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/295285710?timestamp=2483.9999  I dropped a resource in there, too, and we got, like, a ton of leads from it. But they're getting that, like, drip sequence for the emails.  So I'll go ahead and remove the training tomorrow, and then we still have our 11 to 12.

41:39 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  Does that work? Yeah, that's perfect. That's perfect.

41:42 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay. Great.

41:46 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  You're like, Kate, I thought you worked in a startup.

41:49 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  I, I, we were, we were both, like, shocked. You and Anka? Yeah, me and Anka, we were just like, she's  She's like, Athena 911, I was like, oh my god, that's really, like, Anka's invested so many hours into her, and she was just like, I appreciate Anka so much.  And I was like, you're gonna do that to her right before her wedding without even a conversation? It was kind of  up.

42:21 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  I'm like, when's her wedding? When's Anka getting married?

42:24 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Oh, you can't say anything to anyone, sorry, I'm supposed to take that secret, because Ida doesn't know, and we need to keep it that way.

42:32 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  Oh, Ida doesn't know she's getting married?

42:35 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  I can't get into it, but there's...

42:37 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  I'm like, I don't care either. I'm like, I didn't get in. I'm like, I didn't get into that. I'm like, I don't get into workplace drama in general.

42:45 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Honestly, like, you would never know that there's anything going on if Anka didn't tell me. The two of them work beautifully together, like, there's weird.  But this event is the family issue, so that's why I'm like...

43:00 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, I'm like, I'm keeping my mouth shut.

43:02 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  I'm like, yeah, but we'll be going to, I don't know if I told you I'm flying to South Africa next week.

43:09 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  Oh, no, no. I didn't know you were going. I just didn't know what it was.

43:12 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  I'm like, oh, that's rad. That's why we haven't told it. Like, the rest of the team doesn't even know what's happening.  She's going to tell everybody after. So it's just getting so close. I'm, like, getting excited and telling people. So I need to stop doing that because I'm just going to create drama that I don't need to.  Oh, we booked a second. Oh, what's that?

43:34 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  We booked a second intro call just now.

43:37 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Oh, nice. With the automated form thingy?

43:42 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  No, with my favorite email ever. It's a, hey, name dash. I know how my inbox looks.

43:50 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Oh, I saw that one, yeah.

43:52 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  Dot, dot, dot. That email has made me more money than, like, any copywriting I've ever put together by far.

43:59 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  I hated. Did Rachel's person ever book with you?

44:02 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  The one she was like, I sent a message yesterday too, or it was, yeah, I think it was yesterday, which is like, hey Matt, anything specific you're looking for?  And then I never heard back on it either, but I would just like, didn't want to be overly aggressive on that.

44:21 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  No, no, no, no. I think it's like, be consultative and offer some help. Like, hey, I know Rachel's a friend of Athena.  Athena wanted me to make sure you're in good hands. So happy to chat. You know, if you want to talk about your search kind of thing is the way I would play it.

44:35 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, like that. That'll probably be like, maybe my third and final email to him, Athena. It's just like, hey, Athena, like, knows Rachel well, wants to make sure that, like, you're well taken care of.  Like, please let me know if you have an interest in hopping on a call. Like, we're here to help with no pressure.

44:52 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, great.

44:54 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  And I spaced those out quite a bit too. You know what I mean? It's like, I wasn't like, boom, boom, boom, boom with him.  And I haven't done that with anybody in your pipeline, Athena. Like, I had three days before a follow-up message, and that was, like, really, really light.  And those were, like, the ones that were the very closest together. Most stuff was, like, a week, six days, something like that.

45:14 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Got it. So what I might do then is we'll do the contract tomorrow, so I'll get it all sorted tomorrow.  So it's the exact process.

45:30 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  Yeah.

45:31 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  And then today you wanted to talk through the equity thing.

45:39 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  I think I've got, I just was, like, thinking through this last night. But it was, like, it just had to do with, like, Federico wasn't one of the great things about that call, Athena.  It's, like, you can get pre-approved for SBA. Yeah, I've been to Live Oaks webinar and yada, yada, yada. And I'm, like, yeah, man, like, you need an introduction by, like, a trusted partner.  To, like, make that. That happened, you know, he was like, this can get me pre-approved, and I'm like, of course, so that was really fun, but so maybe let me ask this too, because like, if he has $200,000 in cash, I take $70,000 from him, and then he has $130,000, what's that pre-approval letter going to look like?

46:24 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Um, the $70,000 will be, like, applied to his down payment, so it's still $200,000, assuming I get this signed off with the lenders, so that's the caveat right now, and I've got, so I spoke to Matthias yesterday, and he's like, I don't see any reason why you shouldn't, so he seems to think, good, Wendy's got it out with her head of credit right now.  I'm speaking to First Internet Bank, I've reached out to Huntington and Tooney as well to get their take on it, so I wish I had.  More concrete, but with this S&P change, it's just like, they're all figuring out how to navigate it from a lending perspective, so like getting my fees paid is kind of like lower on the, lower on their, yeah, their priority list.  Well, and I'm just selling for it, so like we'll figure it out later. Yeah, so, you know, in theory, based on, oh, that's what I need to do to fund.  Okay, Matthias also gave me a direct email to reach out to the SBA, but he said it's about two weeks going to be concerned.

47:47 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  Yeah.

47:53 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  In theory, and I always say this caveat to people that. So in theory, assuming the lender sees our value and agrees with the way that we support buyers, which a lot of them do, then your fees to us should be able to be applied to your down payment requirements.

48:23 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  Mm hmm.

48:24 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So the analogy I use is like, let's say you're in a lot of them don't understand project costs versus enterprise value.  So a lot of them don't realize there's going to be a whole bunch of other fees in addition to the amount that they pay the owner.  So like that in itself is an education moment. Like, hey, do you understand project costs versus enterprise value or purchase price?  And they're like, uh, it's like, okay, so you're going to have to pay SBA guarantee fees, SBA evaluation, SBA lawyer fees.  In addition to that, you're going to have to pay your. And if you're doing this the right way, then you're also getting a Q of E.  So we say you should be estimating that 5% on average of your purchase price will be your deal costs.  So let's say you're buying a business for a million dollars, then you need to allocate $50,000 to your deal expenses.  So you're taking out a loan for $1,050,000. So the SBA is going to ask you for $105,000 as your 10% down payment.  So you need 10% of the project cost, not the purchase price.

49:43 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, that makes sense. That makes sense. Project cost versus enterprise value. Yeah, that was a, I like tried to have a conversation and like, like, I gave Aravind some context this morning, you know, and it was like, he's like got it in two seconds, right?  Because he's pretty familiar with SBA lending and how it all works, right? But this was someone that wasn't super familiar with SBA and was trying to explain sources and uses and all these other things.  But I think just simplifying it down to like, hey, are you familiar with project costs versus what the purchase price of the business is?  Okay, so you're going to have additional fees being like SBA fees, you're going to have to pay a lawyer or an attorney, an accountant typically to run through a buy side QAV.

50:32 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Don't say accountant. Don't say accountant. Due diligence or QAV, right? Like a financial due diligence provider, quality of earnings.  But because like you don't want to imprint that an accountant can do this kind of work. Like Lynn's having used an accountant on their first one and it was a  nightmare.  And they tried to charge like 17 grand and we didn't even have confidence in the report at the end of it.  So yeah, don't use accountant.

51:04 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, so it's a financial diligence provider, and you're going to have RP in there as well. So above and beyond what we charge you, typically allocate about 5% for those additional fees.  So your down payment's actually bigger on that purchase price. You pay your lawyer anything up front?

51:20 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Project costs. Your down payment's on the project costs.

51:24 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  You said purchase costs. Oh, your down payment's going to be on the project costs. So whether you pay me, your attorney, the financial diligence provider, all that counts for your initial equity injection.  So that 10% that they're going to want down up front. Does that make sense? That's much, much easier to convey.

51:42 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, I try to like move the big words and just use like simple language because a lot of people understand what down payment means.  So like this is an Alex Formosi thing, right? Using 10th grade language for everything, even if it's like a complicated concept.  And I love it. Like, I still want to go back to the way that they explained valuing a business and how to arrive at a multiple because it was so simple.  was like, this is  awesome. So I try to use simple language so they don't feel stupid, right? It's like, okay, you bought a house, know, down payment, right?  So like, and when you buy a house, there's all the other expenses, you know, titling or whatever, valuation.

52:26 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  That's a car thing, but you could use the same thing there, right?

52:30 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  I've never bought a house. I don't know what the other expenses are. So I don't use this analogy, but I'm just like, so when you buy a business, right?  Like 5% of what that purchase price is, you're going to have to pay on top of that. And then there's our fees and you put it all into one bucket, which is your project cost.  And the SBA is going to want you to pay 10% of that total amount. But let's say it's $105,000 in that scenario.  You've already paid us 70. You only need to pay them the additional $35,000. If If If they count our fees towards your down payment.

53:04 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  This is an edge case question, Athena, and I'm just asking this more from my knowledge than anything else. Like, let's say somebody went out and, like, tried to work through multiple transactions and had, like, brought in the attorney at the wrong time.  Like, just did everything wrong. Like, is it only the, like, folks that are, like, necessary for that specific deal?  Or could, like, the project cost from, like, all the -ups that they made in the past be looped into that loan as well?  Okay. Yeah, that's what I could hear.

53:35 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, that's why if somebody, like, works with us and then goes somewhere else, finds a business, we don't help own the clothes, they can't put our fee into the loan.

53:44 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, that makes sense.

53:45 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  We need to demonstrate that our fees were directly related to the deal itself. Which we do. And this is why I'm working with the lenders.  I'm making sure that our agreements are compliant. I'm making sure that we're capturing, because we have to do a lot.  On our side, we have to like fill out forms. We have to justify the pricing, the hourly, you know, make sure it's a reasonable rate.  So there's a fair bit of compliance on our side that I'm making sure up front with this new SOP change that we're doing as much as we humanly possibly can.  But there is still a risk that they could work with a lender that doesn't see us as equity injection, you know.  So we just, as long as we're managing their expectations there now, until I get confirmation from the lenders.

  I don't know how else to play it at this point, apart from being honest, you know.

54:40 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Say that again. I don't know how else to play it at this point, apart from being honest.

54:45 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, I'm like, like, hey, they're like most lenders see us as a part of your essential deal team. Like, we're actually going out, finding the opportunity, evaluating it prior to bringing you in.  So, like, they know you're a qualified buyer, they know it's a qualified. Ideal. It's just a matter of getting it done.  Banks really like working with us typically, but if you're using another lender or we come across someone that maybe doesn't see it that way, there is a risk that this won't be included in that down payment.  But I don't want to say there is a risk that this won't be included in the down payment. I would probably just stop it.  There is a risk.

55:24 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah.

55:26 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  Are you doing Buyer's Club now?

55:28 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  I've got to drop because Wendy's joining us.

55:30 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  If not, it'll be recorded. I can. I have it on my calendar.

55:34 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  I don't have anything going on. I'm going to be asking her from the perspective of what does it take to get a deal over the line?  What are they looking for in buyers? How does that actual process work? So it won't be belaboring the SOP.  It'll be more like, how do you sell yourself to a lender? Right. I'm like, what's that process look like?  And how do you get through it? And how does she view our folks differently than other folks? So my  It be useful for you. No pressure if you've got other sales stuff to do.

56:03 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  I'm like, I went through all stages of pipeline. I just got done with that before we hopped on this call.  So it might be like, what I was going to do is like talk to the sales script again, you know?  Go for it.

56:15 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, yeah, yeah. You can always watch this later.

56:18 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  Okay, cool, cool. Yeah, that's probably what I'll do then. And yeah, good luck. Thanks for catching up, Athena. And then, and your language around explaining, like how that applies to the down payment was really, really helpful.  So I'll probably run this by a couple of times. You're doing me a disservice.

56:40 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  You got to be asking. know, I was supposed to ask you. I need to do it at beginning of the meeting.  I'll do it tomorrow.

56:44 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  All right, absolutely.

56:46 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay, see you later.

56:47 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  Bye, Athena. Bye. Bye.
