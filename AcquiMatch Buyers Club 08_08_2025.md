# AcquiMatch Buyers Club 08/08/2025

[00:00:00] 

**Athena:** Hello? Hello. Hey, Gil 

**Gil:** Readings, 

**Athena:** how's it going? 

**Gil:** Good. Good, good. How are you? 

**Athena:** I'm good. Thank you. Alright, we got a few more folks joining us today. Hello Michael. Hello. 

Hello. Welcome to your first Buyer's Club. 

**Michael:** Yeah, thank you. Glad to be here. So welcome. I'm looking forward to it. 

**Athena:** Yeah, it should be a fun when we're putting me on the spot today, so we'll see how that goes.

Um, let's see. I think we got a few more joining. We'll say hello as they come on. Hey Federica. Welcome. Welcome. Hello. Hello. Welcome. How are you to Fire Club? I'm great. How are you 

**Federico:** doing? Very well, thank you. Awesome. Thank you. 

**Athena:** Cool poll's here. Hey Polly. Hey there. Amazing. Nice to see you. So we've got a few, uh, [00:01:00] new joiners with us, Michael and Federico.

It's their first time in Buyer's Club. Um, they've joined us as clients and then Pauly and Gil have been with us for a while. Uh, Paul and Gill, I would say are our superstar buyer clubs attendees. They're at almost every single one and, um, have gotten a lot of benefit in the deals that they've been looking at and the progress that they've made as a result.

So we use them as an example of, uh, if you can make as many as you can, you learn a lot. So any, uh, first time buyers club advice, Gil, or poll?

**Gil:** Um, like you just said, uh, just open your ears and you learn a lot from other people's, uh, comments and things. Cool. 

**Polly:** Yeah, I can, I can second that. It's a lot of, a lot of information at times, but, um, always. You're always happy to, uh, answer questions and all that. So it's, it's a good setting. 

**Gil:** Awesome. Thank you.

And then definitely rewatched. Um, more than one. More than [00:02:00] once. Yeah. So, yeah, 

**Athena:** that's good. Especially the financial modeling stuff. Right? That's, uh, so it's what, what we're gonna be doing today, which should be a fun one. Fun. 

**Gil:** Yeah. Those are some of the guests as well, so, yeah. Yeah. 

**Athena:** Yeah. We've got some good ones like getting on the docket going forward, but any highlights?

What's, what's been your favorite so far?

**Gil:** I don't really have a favorite, uh, but, uh, there are many highlights. I mean, just the, if you just take a look at the roster of the guests that we had, uh, if you have access to those, uh, previous, uh, um, buyers clubs, you, you'll just, you, you'll learn so much. Yeah. 

**Athena:** Awesome. Any anyone Spring The ability to rewatch 

**Polly:** is great.

I said the ability to rewatch is great. I can't, I would've to go through the whole list and tell you which ones were my favorites. 'cause there have been a lot of them now. So, but 

**Athena:** I think, I think Denise's was a fan favorite. 'cause that just [00:03:00] felt like a Netflix episode 

**Polly:** deal going. Yes. That was actually one of my, I'm glad that you brought that up.

But yeah, that was a good one. Um, Matt Marlow was a good one as well. Um, yeah, that stands out. Um, there have been, there have been a lot of good ones. Like I said, I'll, I would have to pull up the list here too. Come back, thrive since there have been so many. 

**Athena:** Cool. Well, um, so typically on Thursdays we do a little bit of a longer session.

I'm gonna get that updated in everyone's calendar 'cause we, we plan on an hour and a half, but I just realized it's only been in people's calendar for an hour on Thursdays. This is typically when we bring in experts. Um, so today that will be me doing financial modeling, but we bring in usually outside experts every Thursday.

Tuesdays is deal review time. Hey, Peter's here. Hey Peter. Um, and Tuesdays is like, when we'll go through y'all's deals and you can talk with each other and get [00:04:00] feedback from the full team and the other folks that are joining and just learn through, um, people's processes too. And I, I think that's been super useful to just kind of hear where people are at, feel, you know, maybe it's some catharsis that you're not alone in this experience when bad things come up.

Um, but also for me, I, I definitely learned through other people too. 'cause I might, when you're inside the problem. Kind of hard to, to see it for what it is. But when you see somebody else going through the problem, it's like, oh, cool, I learned, I see what the solution is, et cetera. So, um, cool. Well, um, so today is gonna be fun.

Uh, Luke has picked out some p and l statements. I have not seen them before. Um, so the idea is I'm gonna pull up the financial model. I'm gonna pull up these p and l statements and just show you all how I would take those p and l statements, put them into the financial model, um, how I might start looking at structuring, uh, the deal.

So one of the p and ls has an opportunity for a [00:05:00] performance based note based on its past history. Um, so I wanna spend some time kind of talking through that structure, um, and what that might look like and, and try to. Simplify the explanation if I can. Um, it's, it's a bit of a complicated one, but, uh, it's, it's a really cool tool when you wrap your head around it, uh, in the right situation, uh, allows you to kind of push, offers up pretty high, uh, in some instances and incentivizes the owner, um, like an earnout.

But we can't do earnouts with SBI. So, um, I love this tool, um, and I've used it in a lot of structures with, with clients successfully. So anyways, hopefully, um, I don't end up making an absolute fool of myself, like I haven't seen these p and ls before because I wanted to, um, just show you all blind. When I look at a p and l, what am I looking for?

Um, how do I put it into the financial model? I remember when I [00:06:00] first started doing this myself, and I didn't have the, the model that we did, I literally had to like, try to create formulas from scratch and man, uh, it was like. Trying to learn French without a tutor and it took me hours. So, um, it can be frustrating at first, but, um, you know, it gets really quick and I know, um, uh, clients that have used the model now multiple times that it's, it's, it gets easier every time.

Um, and Gil and Polly, I know you guys have used it a couple times, so at first it's like, holy shit, it's like a million sheets and there's so much there, but when you kind of understand the, the mechanics of it, um, it gets easier. So, um, let me share my screen and see what we can do here. Let's see. Okay, so first p and l.

That Luke pulled my request was a really good p and l so we [00:07:00] can see what good looks like, putting it into this spreadsheet. And then the second one is not a great one, it's just one that's in the sim and we're gonna pull it in there and talk about performance notes, um, to, in that second version. So, um, just a reminder, what happens in Buyer's Club Stays in Buyer's Club.

So this is, you know, we're all under NDA together, so please don't share anything from this outside of us. Um, 'cause we are using some examples from previous deals. So I'm gonna share my entire screen because this is a, um, Excel. Um, and then the model is, you know, you're gonna be making a copy of it. So the link that you have on the dashboard, it just makes a copy every single time.

Um, so we're gonna do two of these today, hopefully. We'll see how time goes. [00:08:00] So let's go into this p and l. So this is cool. This is a whole bunch of things. Looks like maybe it was audited financials of some sort, or they just had a really good, uh, accountant or a good broker that actually got them to do their, their books properly.

Um, so there's a lot in here and it can be kind of overwhelming, but we've got balance sheets, which is great. We don't necessarily need those today. Um, on the very first page, we just kind of have an overview, it looks like, of the financials. Oops, wait. Me, I'm trying to get the, there we go. Videos. All the videos outta the way so I can move this around.

There we go. Um. Then we've got the EBITDA calculations. Uh, it looks like they're using, um, adjusted ebitda, which is pretty much the same thing as SDE. There's [00:09:00] EBITDA and then there's adjusted EBITDA where we do owner benefits. Back to it. Um, normalization adjustments means normalizing or, or basically making the financial statements look like what you, as the new owner would have if you were to make all of these adjustments.

So I'm gonna start here 'cause this looks like this is gonna give me mostly what I need. Oh, no it's not. So we wanna look for income, cost of goods sold, expenses and add backs. So we're gonna come back to this 'cause this has our, our add backs here. Let's go to the, uh, income statements. We got monthly.

Revenue smoothing. Ooh, good. There's so much in here. This would be very overwhelming, and most of this you're not gonna need early on. All we're trying to find is top [00:10:00] line 

**Ida:** year by year. Let's see if we can find that.

**Athena:** There we go. Okay, so when we see F, that means forecasted typically. So this is made up numbers. Right. Um, this happens in startup land a lot. Like you'll, uh, uh, startups will say what their valuations is or you know, what their revenue's gonna be. And for me, forecasting is made up you, when you have an existing business.

Um, obviously you can make some assumptions, but I never ever listen to what they say on the forecasting unless they've had like booked revenue. There's, there's invoices and that sort of thing. So when you see f or forecasted, then just know it's made up numbers, right? So you wanna do your valuations based on what's happened in the past.

So we're gonna use 22, 23 and 24, and then we're gonna [00:11:00] go into the sheet and we've already got it set up that it is, um, ending in 2024. Now we don't have any trailing 12, so we're gonna use the same date because the trailing 12 is what we're pulling the valuation off of in this. I always leave these standard to just, you know, assume it's gonna be an asset sale, you're gonna make it an S corp and leaving it at the highest tax rate because that's gonna be the most conservative for you.

Um, unless you're in a situation where you're gonna be using a Robs and you know for sure that you're gonna be doing a C Corp or something like that, you can change it later down the line. But for most of you, you'll be probably running your business as an S-corp. This isn't as, um, this isn't going to make that big of a swing unless you switch from asset to stock sale.

Then it has pretty big tax implications that hit your free cash flow. So that's all you're really looking at here is like, does the [00:12:00] year and the format that I am making, you know that I'm making this purchase in. Roundabout makes sense. Um, also the statements, you know, typically it's accrual or if you were on Elliot's call or you rewatch Elliot Holman's call accrual ish is usually what we see for most businesses.

So, um, then this is where I'm gonna spend my time in the financials tab, so gonna get rid of all this, um, so that I have a clean place to work and I have nothing here. Um, this is an example column, so you know, what should be a negative and what should be a positive. So these numbers are all made up. They don't have any impact on anything here.

Um, so I'm gonna start with 22 and just go from there. So what's my total revenue for each of these? Um, copy that and add it in. [00:13:00] And it's just pretty much that manual thing for all of 'em. I wish there was a better way. Um, and then I'll just, uh, paste out. I hit that with, there we go. I'm pacing it up there so it doesn't mess up the formatting.

Um, but it's, it's pretty manual to do this, but you can get pretty quick with it, um, after some practice. Um, but I like kind of doing it manually because it also gets you a little bit connected to the numbers as you're going through it. And you can start kind of picking up on variances. So already I'm picking up that there was a big jump in revenue from 23 to 24, and down here it's telling me yes, it was a 29% revenue jump in 23 to 24.

So I might highlight that, um, and come back to that as something I'd like to understand why that is. Then I'm going into, uh, doesn't look [00:14:00] like they've done any cost of goods sold. Okay. That's interesting. I don't actually know what this business is, but why is there no cost of goods sold? And is that because they're not running their books properly?

Oh, there we go. Cost of goods. Yeah. They're literally not running cost of goods. So if you're in the state of Texas, for example, um, we get franchise tax and it's based off gross profit. So if you truly have a business where you can have costs of goods sold, which is, um, there are expenses related to selling a product.

You know, I have a landscaping business and I have subcontractors that deliver the landscaping that's cost of goods. Um, other things to run the business. Um. You know, advertising and marketing that can't be attached directly to a product. So that's where your operating expenses come in. So now I'm gonna pull operating expenses [00:15:00] from each year and drop it in.

We don't have any cost of goods, so it's just gonna stay the same. What's really important here, just double click there, put a minus sign, and then add the number so that you want those parentheses around there so that it's deducting it. Do that again. Three times.

You guys are seeing how bad I am with keyboard check shortcuts. Luckily I have short nails this time, so I am not, uh, misfiring on all the keys.

Okay, about that. And put a minus sign. So you want those parentheses around it for operating expenses. So I see that the operating expenses were higher in 22 than they were in 23. So it looks like that they had about flat revenue, but they reduced their operating expenses by a [00:16:00] hundred thousand. So that's one I'm gonna wanna ask about.

Um, then it went up, but they also increased, um, their, uh, revenue significantly. So I'm looking at the percentage of operating expenses. So went up and then it kind of went back down. Um, then when I go into the, um, financials, we wanna look at interest depreciation, amortization, taxes. So these will typically be under the expenses and we add this back.

To the numbers. So these are the numbers that get reported to the IRS and your taxable, uh, portion is on the net income, but you as the new owner, will likely not have the same interest payments. Depreciation is kind of a made up number based on, uh, I won't get onto my rant about capital expenditures, but it's really important that we put the depreciation numbers in here.

So let's see [00:17:00] if there's anything in these p and ls. Um, so I'm just scanning these here. They don't have a ton of, um, expenses in this, so I'm not seeing, um, I'm not seeing interest. I'm not seeing depreciation, I'm not seeing taxes. Um, let's see what they put in their ebitda. Yeah, net income and ebitda, so there's no adjustments there.

So I'm guessing these folks aren't tax optimized because they're not doing, um, uh, any cogs. And also, uh, you know, no depreciation, which maybe it's just a business that doesn't buy any sort of equipment. But I saw print and mail on there, so product, print and mail. So I'm wondering what the products are and what the print and mailing for people.

Um, okay, so now we have [00:18:00] our add backs here. Let me go back to our sheet. So we have nothing here, but when we add in depreciation. We're gonna get an average here, and what's really important is that you copy over when we have a case like this where we don't have the most recent 12 months, which is trailing 12 months, we copy this over to the column here because this far right column is what oops, uh, is what the, um, spreadsheet is gonna calculate from.

Then we're in the add back session and you can, I, you know, will usually delete all these or use these as a guide of like, what am I looking for in the add backs? But when it's blue, you can, you can add things. Um, what some folks do is, is put things in revenue adjustments. You wanna be careful on this because this is literally adjusting your top line revenue.

It's not an add back section. Um, so if there's like, you know, a one time thing that [00:19:00] would increase the revenue. For that year, then you would add that here. Um, it's not often. So just, just, you know, if you're putting something in the revenue adjustments column, just make sure you want it added to this top line revenue number, not as a add back.

Um, now we're gonna look for what their add backs are in this sheet. August benefits, monthly support services. Hmm. Um, I'd be like, you know, when I don't know what an add back is, that's something immediately that I'm like, okay, what, what is that? Why would you be adding that back? So I'm just gonna copy all these 'cause they're in one line.

Um, what I do when I do the, um, modeling is I add back everything and I get their number first before I make any adjustments or before I question. Um, what, uh, [00:20:00] whether I think it's a. Valid add back or not. I just want to get this number to be whatever their number is so I can, I can see how they're valuing and whether I agree or whether it makes financial sense for me to do that.

Um, now I can grab all these. Well, they made it so easy. I love it when this happens. You can just copy and paste multiple things all at once. Um, let's do it like this. Oh, values only to keep the formatting nice. And then we're gonna pull all these over here. Now if I've done a good job, then these numbers down here should match the numbers here.

So 8 4 4 3 8 3. Nope, we're off somewhere. Oh, there we go. Normalization adjustments. That's 

**Ida:** interesting.

Oh

yeah, they adjusted these. Okay. I see what they did [00:21:00] here.

**Athena:** When it says adjusted, it means that they have adjusted these for what it's either normalized or adjusted. So when we see the adjusted number here, they've put the numbers in, um, based on what you, the new owner would have if you accepted all of these add backs. So, um,

**Ida:** unadjusted,

this is interesting. I'm not gonna do the math with you here. Um, I'm gonna 

**Athena:** grab these. Let's see if I can do something, because I wanna actually analyze all these separately. Cast your accrual. Okay, so these are some accounting adjustments that they made. It looks like maybe they were running their books on cash.

They adjusted it to accrual. You wanna be careful on that to make sure. [00:22:00] They're not choosing a time period that makes the numbers more favorable. Sometimes the brokers will advise 'em on that. So this is one I would highlight for sure, like what happened. Um, so I'm just gonna highlight these in here. This August, benefits, monthly support services.

Um, what is that? Um, fair value adjustment. It looks like they are, um, doing a negative add back, which means typically we add back one owner's salary. Um, if there are two owners that are leaving, then we're gonna need to replace one of the owners. So when there's a negative add back, it's like, well, how much are you going to have to pay to replace one of the owners?

So it looks like they've done that here. Um, then you're getting a positive add back for owner two, um, support staff salary. That's a negative add-back. So they're [00:23:00] saying that there's additional support that's gonna be needed. What's that? This one for sure is jumping out at me. This cash to approval adjustment.

Um, you know, that's something that you're gonna have to dive into. SBA loans off tax returns. So as long as the books can be tied up to what's on the tax return with this adjustment, then it can all make sense. But I've been in deals where this gets really messy, um, when they had cash statements, but they maybe like reported accrual.

And then the, the, there's this, um, box that needs to match on the statements to be able to tie it all together. So sometimes the add-backs can be questionable there. And then owners took a lot of money out of this business. Um.

The final year, which they didn't do in the previous years.[00:24:00] 

That's also interesting. So what you're seeing is me looking for variances, right? Like, where does something jump out that was not there before? Why did they suddenly take out that kind of money from the business, um,

in that year, but not in previous years? What did they do in 2024 that got them that kind of growth? Pretty significant growth. Is it sustainable? So I'm just looking for things that I'm seeing that jump out at me that when I get on the broker call, or even the owner call, I can ask them about, um, and dig into that because the first thing the lenders are gonna do is ask you about every single one of these variances, right?

And you wanna have the answer for it. So it's better to start seeing if you can spot those variances, which is why it kind of [00:25:00] sucks to have to manually enter all these numbers. But you see how as I was manually entering it, I was kind of looking at 'em and being like, oh, that's interesting. So I feel like it kind of connects you to the numbers a little bit more.

Um, now what I need to do is get, um, these numbers to match these numbers. Uh, I wouldn't normally do this, but um, I'm not gonna, uh, take you guys through all of the, um, calculations. Let's see. So we wanna. Get these equaling. Actually, the only thing I need to adjust, let me get out of this. Um, sorry. Ignore this.

The only thing I need to adjust is getting this number back to this one because this final number, this adjusted EBITDA or SDE, is what we're gonna use for our evaluation. So I'm just gonna get this to be [00:26:00] this. Let's see if it doesn't get mad at me for doing a circular thing. No.

Okay. Right. Any questions on adding financials into this tab so far? Like you wouldn't normally edit this column. I'm just doing it for the sake of the valuation, but in terms of how I just did all of that before I move on to structuring. All good. Making sense? Okay, cool. Um, now the next, these are the two tabs.

You're gonna be spending the most of your time, financials and deal structure, fin, and now we get into the deal structure and, um, this is where we get to start playing around with what this deal might look like. I always start with whatever the asking price is on the business and whatever terms that they're saying, um, they want [00:27:00] so that I can evaluate where they're coming from and how far off I think we might be from this making sense for me.

So let's say they're asking for a three x multiple, um, on the, you get two inputs here on purchase price. So you can either hand write it in and it will tell you what that multiple is, or you can do it by multiple, you toggle A or B. To decide which one you wanna do. So let's say it's a three x multiple.

Um, so that would put it at 3.4 million. Um, these blue boxes you don't necessarily need to fill out. If we had a depreciation number that would be pulling through here, because it's likely, if there is depreciation every single year, then you might have to make those, uh, investments into the business going forward.

So we're gonna leave it at average for the annual CapEx and it's gonna pull it [00:28:00] out in the model down the line later. You can add in what your, um, CapEx requirements are as you learn more about the business and just toggle that to input versus average. This working capital requirement of the business is really important.

Um. If they're not, if they're trying to not include working capital, or when you start, you, you won't know this off the bat, but when you get a little bit further down the line, you're gonna know what the working capital requirement is of the business. Especially if you do a qv. So let's say they come back and say you need 200,000, but the seller is insistent that they're only including 100,000.

You would put it in like that. Um, but let's, let's just say working capital's included in this one. Um, we're putting in 10%, so we're just gonna do a straight up SBA situation here where we're putting [00:29:00] 10% down for equity injection of the total purchase price. And we're gonna, I'm seeing 9.5 right now, pretty much for most.

Oops, that would be insane. I'd tell you to run away from that one if it was 95%. So this is where on most of your deals, you're just gonna be filling in the seven a loan section. Um, so we let, there's no real estate in this one. Interest rate, 9.5 term is 10 years. Um, I always just kind of leave it like, let's assume we're getting a hundred thousand dollars line of credit.

Um, and then here is where you can start doing, uh, seller notes and forgivable performance notes. But I, before I get into that, I see Peter has a question. What's your question, Peter? 

**Peter:** Yeah. Yeah. So how, how would you model out? Um, I, I'm, I'm at the beginning of a deal right now where the purchase price is one [00:30:00] thing and then it says, doesn't include inventory.

And so. Okay, that's cool. Which means it's not a real purchase price, right? I mean, it's like you could tell me inventory is a dollar, which it significantly is not, and then it's purchase price plus a dollar, which is a real price. Right? So how would you model that out when it's like they're saying, oh, it's probably somewhere that's basically double the purchase price.

I mean, as, as an example that's live right now. It's like the asking price is like a, uh, one and a half million dollars. They're saying inventory is anywhere from one and a half to two. So, okay, great. Let's choose the lower number. It's really $3 million right now, not one and a half. 

**Athena:** Yeah. 

**Peter:** Yeah. 

**Athena:** So tactically I would model this, um, assuming that I'm including working capital because my offer is going to include networking capital.

So with inventory. Um, they're going to say, oh, there's one [00:31:00] and a half million dollars worth of inventory. Some of that inventory's probably been sitting there for 10 years or however long they've bought the business. Right? Sure. Um, so when you buy a business, there is a certain level of inventory that you need on day one to be able to run the business on day one Yep.

Until you start getting paid from people. Yeah. So, um, what I do is I don't start getting into those conversations first. I have a conversation with the broker, with the owner. I see if I like the business or not. I start developing a relationship and then I can get into, like, deal terms later. But I start from the point of assuming like I, either they're including working capital or I'm lowering my purchase price for working capital.

Now with inventory, if they have excess inventory, the way I typically like to treat that in a deal is. You have your networking capital, and the way I describe this is you've bought a vending machine [00:32:00] business from someone, right? And in order to run that business, those vending machines need to be stocked, right?

So if you've bought a vending machine business from someone and you take over day one and there's no inventory in the vending machines, then you've just bought the machines. You haven't bought a business. So when you're buying a business that requires inventory in order for it to run, you don't yet know what the working capital requirements are because you don't know what their payment terms are.

With suppliers, you don't know what their payment terms are. With clients, when you get more of that information, you'll be able to work out like, okay, well they take, they take a job from a client, but they don't get paid for 60 days, but they have to pay their suppliers within 30 days. So when I take over day one, I need enough.

Candy and the vending machine to be able to, you know, keep servicing clients [00:33:00] until I get new money from the people that are paying me, you know, two months later. This is how businesses are valued it. They got the business to a certain point by being able to extend payment terms and being able to take payment terms, and it took them a while to get that, and that's what you're buying the business on the basis of.

If they say that no inventory and no working capital is included, that means that you need to reduce the purchase price to account for the fact you're gonna have to pay that stuff to be able, you're gonna have to buy all that stuff to operate the business from day one. It's not a going concern, but I don't get into these conversations with 'em before I even know if I like the business or I like the person or I wanna buy the business.

A lot of times it's unsophisticated broker that doesn't understand this. And sellers definitely don't understand this. So there's one thing which is a working capital, and I need a certain level of inventory to be able to buy this business. Sure. That typically [00:34:00] isn't determined until you've done a full Q of E exercise on the business to determine how much it is.

Right. So you can't, you can't value you at, at this point, which is why I say I assume that there's working capital included in the business with all that excess inventory. What I typically like structured in deals is it's on consignment and you buy it as you need it, and then Sure. If there's a whole bunch of dead inventory after the amount of time that you guys are agreeing that it's on consignment, then the seller can do whatever they want with that inventory, but you don't have to buy it off of them.

**Peter:** So, so you're basically, all right. I have, I have two more follow-up questions. Uh, so the first is.

You are basically buying enough of the inventory to operate day one, right? Yeah. I mean it's like the offer, right? So if, if they have inventory that will allow you to operate for three months, [00:35:00] well okay, that's fine. But you don't need to buy all of it, you're saying, okay, great. You don't need to buy out three months worth of inventory just yet into the purchase price of the deal.

All you need is enough to get that first cash cycle that could be 30 days. But that's included 

**Athena:** in the purchase price that's considered working capital. 

**Peter:** Sure. Correct, correct. 

**Athena:** So like whatever. That's why I leave this blank to start. 'cause you don't know the working capital requirements of the business.

You don't know how much inventory is required. So when you get to the point of making an offer in an LOI, we're gonna be basing this offer on the fact that they're including enough inventory to keep you going until you get the next payments from clients. 

**Peter:** I see. So it's just for the model, it's an assumption that enough working capital, whenever I pay you, the assumption is it's enough working capital.

That's what's, and, and then of course as the LOI, I haven't looked at like the LOI structure yet. I'm not there yet, but like I, I'm assuming it's like, okay, [00:36:00] this LOI is contingent upon, you know, folks in the deal not being, yeah, there's a total goofballs about working cow. I know you used different words than that, but like 

**Athena:** there's a, there's a section in the L OI template that, that, that says that, uh, you know, this includes a, a, you know, networking capital, which will be determined doing during due diligence.

**Peter:** Yep. Okay. Okay. Because 

**Athena:** you can't. You can't figure out how much working capital that you need without access to all of the things you're gonna get. And having somebody actually look at how is inventory flowing in and out, which inventory is it? How long does it take for them to get paid from clients? How much of that, you know, inventory is dead, et cetera.

Like it's such a complicated calculation that you would never do that pre LOI. Yeah. Got it. And if they're saying that, um, that no working capital is included, um, then we have to try to make an a determination of some number pre LOI [00:37:00] reduce the purchase price for that because you're still gonna, like, regardless of whether they're including it or not, you're gonna have to pay for it.

The bank's gonna make you right? 'cause it's like you can't take over that business day one and have two months before you get paid and no inventory. You're gonna have to buy that inventory to be able to operate from day one. 

**Peter:** And so then it's a negotiate, I mean, it's a, it's a negotiation. They say they may, I mean, I'm sure you've had sellers that are like, no, even though the business is worth 10 million, I still am holding out for a hundred million.

I'm hoping that some buyer comes to me with 10 x the worth and then the deal's just dead for who, whoever currently is on it right now. And then maybe they'll come back in the future and get real. I mean, right. So it's like there is still this, if somebody's that, um, I guess holding out for, I want my price plus working capital and it's valued and we're just too far apart, that is what it is.

I [00:38:00] mean, I guess that's where, that's the worst case scenario of where this goes, right? It's just like somebody just says, oh, how I want this deal structured for what I want. It just doesn't make sense on day one for the networking capital that's happened or, uh, 

**Athena:** so I. You kind of wanna avoid the working capital conversations before you feel like you can break bread with the owner.

**Peter:** Perfect. No, I I, that's exactly right. That's exactly, I'm that then. Yeah, I just ignore it. So 

**Athena:** like, I didn't 

**Peter:** bring up that they're, 'cause I think it's crazy. Anyway, so I'm not, I'm like, I was on the phone with the owner yesterday, so 

**Athena:** Well, oftentimes I don't understand it. They just don't understand how it works.

So when they trust you and they like you and you can actually sit down and, you know, talk about like, okay, when you buy a car, do you expect there to be gas in the tank? And they're like, yeah, well how would you drive it off a lot? Right? It's the same thing with a business. So like you, but having that [00:39:00] relationship with them.

But I guess for the purposes of today of just like basic calculation. Yeah. Just 

**Peter:** ignore, always assume. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Assume 

**Athena:** that you're gonna have networking capital when you start getting. Some ideas 'cause this, this, this doc, this, this model can work with you through the deal as you get information Yeah.

You know what the working capital requirement is and your QV person's like, you're gonna need 500,000, right? Yeah, yeah. Or the bank's like, we wanna see at least 500,000 working capital in here. You put it in here and then they're leaving nothing in the business. Well, your free cash flow number shouldn't be affected by the fact that they're not leaving that in.

So then you start toggling purchase price. 

**Peter:** Got it. Okay. Cool. Thank you. 

**Athena:** No worries. Um, okay, so, um, I'm gonna spend some time, I'm not gonna do this second p and l 'cause I, I'm [00:40:00] just conscious of time and I wanna spend some time talking through seller notes and particularly forgivable performance based notes.

Um. So is everyone tracking? So far on, on what we've done? We basically we're, we're using a three x multiple. We're just assuming that working capital is included in this deal. Um, we are having just standard SBA terms of 9.5% and we, the buyer are gonna do a 10% equity injection, right? So it's pretty simple so far.

We're gonna assume there's no real estate in it. Um, now we're at the point where we can use seller notes and we can use them in a couple different ways. Um, one is on standby. We can use the [00:41:00] seller's, uh, seller, a, a seller note to have them contribute towards your equity injection with the SBA. It used to be that they only needed to be on standby for two years, and, um, they could, you know, do 5% or even more as seller debt, which could, which could contribute towards your equity injection.

So let me use some simpler words for this. The bank wants you to put, uh, 10% of the overall project costs into, um, they want you to do basically a 10% down payment, right? And that can come from you. It can come from the seller, it can come from having paid for expenses that are gonna be part of this deal before, but regardless, in order for the bank to protect their [00:42:00] guarantee from the SBA, there needs to be a 10% equity contribution Now.

In April, there was a big, uh, standard operating procedure update from the SBA that changed the standby period from two years to 10 years, which sucked because we used to use this all the time. We used to be able to double your buying power just by getting the seller to agree to a 5% note that was on standby for two years.

Now it's 10. But the way that we're seeing this used is, let's say it's a larger deal and you're at the top end of, you know, like you don't have enough cash to be able to do the full 10% yourself. What you could potentially do is increase the purchase price. Ask the seller to take a 5% note on full standby for 10 years, and then you only need [00:43:00] to offer 5%.

Um. Of the total project cost. So you can still increase your buying power, but this is a pretty advanced move because you have to have a really good relationship with the seller and the deal still needs to work if you're going to increase the purchase price. Um, so we used to use this all the time, which is why it's at the top now.

We don't use it very much at all. Um, seller note two is essentially having them have some skin in the game. They're not gonna get a hundred percent of their cash at close. I always like to see at least 5, 10, 5, 10% from the seller as a seller note. And you can pretty much do whatever you want in terms of the terms.

Um, and negotiate with them on insurance or, uh, on interest rates and stuff. But the SBA does wanna see them not get paid out before the bank [00:44:00] does. So it's usually over 10 years. You can potentially do a balloon payment, um, on this one. Um, oh, sorry. It's equity injection. They don't wanna get paid first, but I typically amortize it over 10 years for the seller note.

And then you can, you can do a balloon, which means you pay whatever's left after say, five years. Um, I usually leave this at, no, and it's just a little like tool I have in my back pocket if they're like, well, I don't wanna wait 10 years to get paid, or, you know, maybe they're 85 and they're like, I don't know if I'm gonna be here in 10 years to get paid.

I was like, okay, well how about we do a balloon? So it protects your cash flow initially. Um, and then, uh, uh, they can get paid out. And if you don't have enough money. The business to be able to do this. You can refinance with the SBA, um, or even a private lender at that point, or just a, a normal commercial lender sometimes because you have that history with [00:45:00] them.

Um, you know, say in, in five years, the forgivable performance base note is where I have the most fun, and it's someone that gets a little complicated and a little bit like what? So, um, private equity uses something called earnouts, which is incentivizing the owner to help them get the business performing better than it has in the past.

And if they do that, they are rewarded with more money. Now, SBA doesn't like this. We can't do earnouts. We can't just say like, okay, Mr. Owner, I know you've never gotten more than a million dollars in revenue, but if you help me get the business $2 million in revenue, I'll pay you a whole bunch more money.

You can't do that. What you can do is incentive a them to get the business back to something that they achieved in the past. So [00:46:00] while most people see, uh, a, you know what they're perceiving as revenue drop in 23 and 24, it's usually a normalization because what most businesses did in 20 20, 20 21 is they had a drop because of COVID, and then they had a, um, catch up in 22.

So they had a big year in 22, and then they dropped in 23. Now if we're only looking at the last three years, we see high number then drop. If you look back historically in the, the performance, it might be a normalization back to whatever levels they were at pre COVID. But if we see a year in the past that was higher than it was, um, in recent years, then we have the opportunity to incentivize the owner to get the business back to what it's performed in the past.

And if they don't do [00:47:00] this, then that portion of money that we're saying will pay them is forgiven. So it's called a forgivable performance based notes because it's based on performance after you buy it and it's forgiven if that performance is not met. So we can use this both to incentivize the owner to get back to historical numbers, or we can use it to protect ourselves if we're worried that they're gonna have a drop in revenue.

So we could just say like, you need to at least perform, like maybe they had a. Massive year, like what we saw here, right? Well, in 24 they just jumped, you know, almost 30%. Well, is that sustainable or did they try to do that, beef it up and sell it? It's like, okay, well I'm need to do a forgivable performance based note based on you achieving, uh, on the business, achieving $1.9 million in revenue in the first year of my ownership.

So you're not incentivizing them to do more than they've done in the past. But if [00:48:00] that is not sustainable, then that portion of the deal can be forgiven. So let's say, okay, we feel like, you know, 20% of this purchase price should be forgiven if they don't hit the numbers that they hit in the previous year.

I always recommend doing this as prorata. Um, if you're gonna be doing a. Uh, benchmark from like performance to, to get it up to something. If you're gonna be doing just flat year on year, then it's, it's a target, which is the minimum percentage, which is 0%, right? So if they don't at least hit that, then 20% of the purchase price will be forgiven and you can base it off it being achieved in the first and second year of ownership or just the first year.

So that's what it means, year one and year [00:49:00] two of ownership. So if you're like, okay, Mr. Seller, I just want you to show me that this business can achieve 1.9 million in revenue in the first year. If it does, then I will pay you 20% of this purchase price. Um, I'll do it over nine years at 7% interest. Is everyone tracking on the concept of the performance note?

I don't see all the faces. Lemme see if I see some nods. Yeah. Okay, so we're, we're tracking on that. So in this example, we're just wanting them to maintain what they did in 2024, and if they do, then 20% of the purchase price that we're offering will be released to them. Now if we wanna see how this works in this forecast assumptions, we have the opportunity to [00:50:00] do three different scenarios to look at it side by side and see how, how it performs.

So, in a no change scenario, I always recommend doing a no change, where literally nothing changes. You have no revenue growth, you have no operating expenses, increases. That's a no change. Best case is like, okay, you know, if you, if the seller's telling you like they've got all this booked revenue or whatever, you can say like, okay, let's do a 15% growth year one, year two.

This is, this is where you get to wave a magic wand and have fun and make up numbers, right, and get yourself excited. But we never, ever buy a business based on potential. Um, and the s and p 500, all those companies, the best 500 companies in this country typically don't grow by more than 5% a year. So just be careful of whatever benchmark you're putting for best case, you know, like, uh, and then best case on your operating [00:51:00] expenses, like, are you gonna be doing any reductions or growth?

So, um, there's some kind of standard ones in here, but just pay attention to this one. And if you wanna be more conservative, you can do that. Then your worst case scenario is like accounting for a J curve. So let's say you have a 10% revenue drop, both in year one and year two, and then you're flat for the next three years, and then maybe have a 3% growth, uh, year six through 10.

And you also have 5% increase in expenses, um, year over year. So for this example, I'm just gonna show you what it looks like if you have a 10% drop with the performance note and everything else the same. So we have 10% drop, and then this scenario that I'm talking about here is 0%, et cetera. Um, these boxes here, if you wanna make a one-time adjustment, I'm not gonna get into that now, but like for this one, let's say, you know, I've, I've [00:52:00] said, okay, 20% will be paid if they at least hit 0%.

So then we can go over to these tabs here and see what that looks like in our no change scenario. You know, um, he, this, this business achieves 1.9 no more. All of the other expenses stay the same. Um, we're accounting for our own, uh, um, we're accounting for our own, uh, tax payments and everything. Um, let's see.

There's something here that's not working. Oh, I didn't, uh, 1.9 operating income.

I need to make sure that I added that all back in. Let me just go back to the financials and make sure.[00:53:00] 

**Ida:** Yeah. 1, 1, 2, structure. One, one. It might be pulling. These numbers here. So I'm just gonna delete these real quick and make sure

there we go. That's more 

**Athena:** reasonable. Um, okay, so this is a number I always go to. First is what's a free cash flow to you? The buyer, like this is after taxes are taken out, this is after you know CapEx. This is after all the other operating expenses that you're gonna have. This is after your debt payments.

This is what hits your bank account. So what's really important about this number is to understand this is post-tax, right? Because we have that 37.5% tax rate in there. So this is money to your bank account. So that's something that when you're comparing like what your salary is versus what your take home is, and looking at these free cash flow numbers, you just want to bear that in mind.[00:54:00] 

And then your debt service coverage ratio. So this is both to the SBA and the seller. And if you were to fully pull your line of credit, so this is pretty decent, right? You're able to make it the whole 10 years and it's only near 10 where you're getting below 1.5 debt service coverage ratio. It turns red whenever it's below 1.5.

This is with a fully pulled line of credit. So the third line you don't pay attention to as much, but let's say that worst case, they don't make those numbers. You have a 10% drop, you don't owe that performance note, right? So it's not being pulled out here.

Performance note. Nothing's coming out in terms of performance note payments. You do have a 10% drop in revenue and then you're flat after that. These are the numbers that you make, but you're still okay from a debt service coverage ratio [00:55:00] perspective. So that's why we do the performance note is because you're still protected.

Now, if we didn't do the performance note, um, then you have to pay the full purchase price regardless of what happens. So let's look at what happens here. When we put the deal structure in and we take that performance note out,

you're in a worst case scenario and our take home is significantly less, right? And we're. Below debt service coverage ratio, we can still make it. It's not ideal. It's because we do a three x, which we're not typically gonna see if we have a million in ebitda, but let's say we do. But your take home numbers are not nearly as fun, right?

For most of you, that's not enough to make it worth doing an investment of this size. So that's why a performance based note, even [00:56:00] if we can't tie them to doing, um, um, to get higher numbers, we can create a performance based note to have them at least perform in a certain way. Typically, we're gonna do this if they're asking for a pretty high asking price right here where it's reasonable.

You might not get somebody agreeing to that because somebody else will come in and offer the whole thing and maybe just 10%, no. Okay. Did that concept make sense in how we put it into the, um, 

**Ida:** model here?

Yeah. 

**Athena:** Cool. Um, good. Okay, so we're at time. It was a really silent session, which always makes me nervous. Was that helpful? Do we feel like we have a little bit more, a little bit more? We could be dangerous with the notes. Federico, you have a question? 

**Federico:** Uh, yes, [00:57:00] I do. I just wanna make sure I understood correctly regarding the performing based, uh, note.

Is that payable, uh, uh, over 10 years, it cannot be paid before, is that correct? 

**Athena:** No, you can pay it before as long as the debt service coverage ratio still works. So that's what the bank's gonna be looking at is and why we have it in the model that way. Is that, um, here, let me pull it up. 

**Federico:** Oh, okay. So what was it that you said about the two years not being, um, accepted anymore?

It had to be. Of the 10 year mark. 

**Athena:** Yeah, it's if you're using a seller note towards your equity injection. 

**Federico:** Oh, okay. The equity injection. Okay, got it. 

**Athena:** Exactly. Yeah, that's this first one typically. So it used to be that you could have the seller take a 5% note and then you would only need to contribute 5% instead of 10, and 

**Federico:** they 

**Athena:** can start getting payments after two years.

Now it's 10. 

**Federico:** Okay, perfect. That makes sense. 

**Athena:** Yeah. But with the performance note, no. Um, so what the SBA is gonna check is, [00:58:00] um, this here, does the debt service coverage still work if you, if you have to pay the note or in this no change scenario. Right. Like if they actually perform the way they do, like, you're golden.

And usually I, in, in a no change scenario, I wanna see at least greens for two, three years. Um, you know, J Curve is gonna hit in two years. You might be flat. I, I, you know, I've had. Lots of clients and friends, they, they didn't have the J curve drop, but they didn't have an increase either. It just kind of, they were able to keep it on track, right?

So you wanna see at least like two, three years of greens here in these top two boxes. Again, this third one is, if you were to fully draw the line of credit, which they all also look at, we've included this in here, is 'cause when you send it over to the lenders, when you start getting to that stage, they're like, whoa, you've really thought of everything and done all your modeling.

Like, you know, they get very frustrated when [00:59:00] people are like, what do you think? And they're like, have you modeled this at all? Have you done any cashflow forecasting? So, and, and then they're saying that you're looking at like worst case scenario across the board. Um, so you can on those other notes say do a five year balloon if you want.

Um. Or you can pay 'em over a shorter amount of time. Like let's say you amortize it over five years, but this still needs to be typically above 1.5 for most lenders. Some will go down to like 1.15, but I don't ever like seeing y'all go below 1.5 because you need some wrinkle room. Right? Yeah. So something happens like you're just having a, a little bit more of a buffer there.

So even though some lenders will go lower, like I and the team will never in good conscience tell you to go lower, um, on a deal. 'cause it's, it's, it's a little bit scary if you literally have no buffer and something goes wrong. [01:00:00] 

**Federico:** Absolutely. Thank you. 

**Athena:** You're so welcome. Any other questions? Um, what I think is a good practice is just taking those p and ls, like any deal that you have any sort of interest in, take those p and ls.

And drop 'em into this financial model, right? And do what you saw me do at the beginning. And yes, it's a little monotonous or whatever, but as you're going through those numbers, you can start picking up on things and then you have something ready to go. Like, you know, you get on the broker call and you're like, okay, broker didn't have any information.

I'm gonna go and talk to the owner, talk to the owner. I'm like, I love them. I know there's other people in the mix. Then you're not scrambling to try to get the model together. You've already, you know, put it together and it helps inform the questions that you might ask to the broker and the seller. So, um, I, I have, have trained myself to the point that I can't really give comments on a deal of whether it's good or bad without looking at, at that, [01:01:00] right?

Like, what's the, what's the upside to you? What is, what are they asking? What does that actually look like in cashflow and debt service coverage ratio? Um, in the terms that, that we're asking about, you know, and what they're saying. So, um. It's good practice, I think both from a evaluation standpoint, but also being ready to go and kind of getting your reps in to do this for every single deal.

Um, because when it's, it's one that you're looking at yourself, it hits differently than like watching me do it. You know, you've got the adrenaline, you've got the relationship. It's like, might be the one. So, um, and. Some of our folks that have been here longer have had all sorts of interesting financial statements that they've had to navigate, you know, um, Polly and Steve were looking at one that had like three different locations and three different p and ls, and they had to like, compile 'em all together to try to do modeling and stuff.

So every single, there's no standardization for how the brokers pre [01:02:00] present the financials, so we kind of need to be an investigator and like do it on every single one. But anyways, um, I hope that was, 

**Polly:** I have a question. Yes, Paul? I don't wanna overcomplicate things. It's just something I was thinking about.

So you were talking about working capital and talking about inventory. So obviously it doesn't have to be onsite inventory. So if you have a business, let's say, that has, they're, they're issuing, you know, pos to their different vendors and so forth, and fulfilling orders, if you. Offering, say terms to your clients, terms to your customers, does that usually mean that you're gonna have to have a higher working working capital because you're, you're issuing those types of terms?

**Athena:** Yeah. So like, let's say you take over a coffee cup manufacturing business mm-hmm. [01:03:00] As the new owner on day one, you already have orders that you have to fulfill, assuming the owner had, you know, orders that were open. So you're having to continue to manufacture your coffee cups and send your coffee cups to those clients.

But the new client, new orders coming in on day one, you, let's say you, you, you as a practice give them 30 day payment terms. So you're delivering products for clients that had. You know, the 30 day payment terms of whatever on day one, right? But you don't get new money and, and it might be that the seller's like, well, I already delivered for those clients.

Or what it ends up being this whole thing where you need a good relationship with them because they often won't understand their own books or working capital. So they will think that they should for anything they sold previously, they think they should continue to get paid for that, even though you're it on day one.

So [01:04:00] as the bank's looking at it, like on day one, you're gonna have to make coffee cups or you're gonna have to send coffee cups to clients. If there are coffee cups on the shelves on day one, you need to purchase those so that on day one, when you take over the business, you can make money and send those coffee cups out.

So if the seller is not leaving the coffee cups on the shelf, you have to buy the coffee cups, which means you're overpaying for the business if you give them the purchase price and pay for the coffee cups on top of it. 

**Polly:** Okay. If that answers my question. Thanks. 

**Athena:** Yeah. Does that help? Sorry. Yeah. Working capital is like one of those, like I was just writing down, I'm like thinking of people that I wanna invite to future buyers club and, and I saw this guy speak who just like did this most energetic, like working capital like presentation ever.

So I'm like, I'm hoping I can get him in because I, I don't think you can hear it in enough ways. And then it also further gets complicated when it's like working capital can include accounts receivable, [01:05:00] working capital can include inventory in the business. Like, and, and so then every business is gonna be completely different, which is why I don't like having that discussion beyond, Hey, we're gonna figure out what the working capital number looks like in due diligence, because that's when all the books are gonna be open to you, et cetera, et cetera.

What a lot of brokers do on. Smaller deals, or what they did historically is they didn't understand working capital. So they just thought it was, you know, cash free, debt free. And they included working capital as part of that. Okay. But the way that businesses are valued now with this like rush of everybody trying to buy businesses is that the valuations and the purchase prices have gone up.

So before, if you were paying a two x multiple and they were like, no working capital, it's like, okay, cool, I'll add, I'm only paying two XI can pay for the working capital on top. Mm-hmm. But now that we're pushing, you know, into like four [01:06:00] x on something that might have gotten to two XA couple years ago before the internet discovered business buying, then you would have to, you, you're overpaying for it, right?

Because you're gonna still have to go and buy those coffee cups to be able to sell coffee cups to customers. So it's, it's a really interesting kind of conundrum with the most of the brokering industry, being old school, doing it a certain way, and then riding this storm of this gold rush of all these like new unsophisticated buyers trying to buy businesses.

So. 

**Polly:** Mm-hmm. Okay. 

**Athena:** Oftentimes it ends up being a rapport building conversation, and often education to both a broker and the. Seller, but it's better done when they trust you and they like you. But even still, I've had clients that like spent so much time trying to explain it to the owners and then after they bought the business, it's, it just, it was months of like confusion.

'cause the sellers didn't understand their own books. You know, you guys have spreadsheets like this, that if you put in front of the [01:07:00] owner, the owner would not get it. You know, and that's what always perplexes me is the bank wants you to have the ability to do this, but the, the current owner does not have the ability to do that.

So, you know, judging you on whether you'd be a good owner of the business based on being able to do this stuff. But that's, that's a rant for another day. So, um, Federico, I saw you had another question. 

**Federico:** Yes, I have uh, another question, probably unrelated, but in, in real estate, you buy something, let's say for a hundred thousand and the seller has, uh, a debt on it.

It is understood that the debt gets paid from the a hundred thousand. I was looking at a plumbing, at a plumbing business, and there were cars that were owed and other, other, other, other things. So the question is, do you buy the business for a a million and then you have to buy the cars as well, or does the seller pay off the cars and then he gets a difference as in real estate?

Yeah, that's a really good 

**Athena:** question. So that's, that's typically what [01:08:00] cash free. Debt free means is that, that there's gonna be no debt on the business when you take it over, which means whatever you pay, you don't need to value the business any differently, right? Like they took out debt on the business, it's an asset of the business's required to run the business.

Um, so they would pay off those loans with whatever the proceeds were from the purchase price. Now, in some instances, I've seen that be a negotiating tool where you take over some of the loans or you take over the, you know, maybe it's a lease. Um, but if, if it's a, a lease and ideally those would be coming out of the expenses, so it'd already be accounted for in, in the operating expenses of the business.

So it's. Case by case. How sophisticated is a broker? How good are their books? What's the owner been told? Right. Okay. They might not realize that they have to use their loan proceeds to pay off all of the debt and then, um, and then you could end up losing, you know, the deal when they find out too late in the [01:09:00] game.

'cause no one explained that to them. 

**Federico:** Okay. So it's expected that their business will be bought free and clear pretty much across the board. Okay. And, and 

**Athena:** when you're reviewing sims, you'll, you'll see that in the sim the brokers will typically say like, this is offered asset purchase on a cash free, debt-free basis.

Right. Okay. Um, and then they lump working capital into that in their minds if they don't understand that working capital is separate from debt and cash in the banking bank account. Perfect. Thank you again. Good questions. Awesome. Um, well that was fun. I totally nerd out too much about doing financial modeling.

I can never do enough of it. Uh, and you got to see me like blind look at a financial statement, so hopefully I didn't embarrass myself too much. I wanted to get through a couple more, but um, just wanted to make sure we got through to the performance set section. Um, when, when you get a deal that you're interested in and, and you want us to help you with the structuring, for those of you that are newer [01:10:00] to us, if you get the financial tabs, financials tab filled out, that helps us to be able to jump in and start working through the deal structuring with you and, um.

Steve and Polly and Justin and Gil will all know this. Like, we'll usually pull it up and I'll start, you know, changing a bunch of things and, uh, recording it and then you get to go back and watch me do it like three times or whatever. So we're, we're here to support with the, the deal structure in that side of it.

But like putting those financials in is a really good practice. So you can start seeing like, where are the variances? Or you know, what is this add back? Like we were just discussing as a team, um, you know, cash is looking at a deal where there's all these like crazy add backs and he is like, I don't know about this.

And it's like, okay, yeah, totally. Like that's what we should like, dig in into and, and ask about, um, so that we can give you that. And it's not necessarily that we won't put it in front of you, but it's, you know, you wanna flag those things early to have the discussion because when you get to the [01:11:00] lenders, a lot of times they'll throw out a lot of that backs, you know, um, and.

That will materially affect the sd. So I think something Elliot said, either in his most recent session or the one before, is like when they're gonna get three or four times, every single dollar that they find is SD in that business, of course they're incentivized to try to say as many dollars as possible are gonna be like to the, the new owner's benefit, you know?

Um, but yeah, I've seen some wild add-backs in there before. Um, and I've even seen financial statements that made me break out into hysterical laughter. So never forget that was Steven Bali.

**Polly:** Um, yeah, that was a, that was an awakening moment right there. We were, we kind of thought, eh, that doesn't look, so when, once you started laughing out, we were like, okay. It's, uh, it's even more unrealistic than we thought. [01:12:00] So, 

**Athena:** yeah, it 

**Polly:** was, uh, that was wild. But 

**Athena:** anyways, cool. This was fun. So, um, next Tuesday, we'll, we'll do deal reveals as normal.

So any questions or modeling or things about the deals that you're looking at? Um, for those of you that are working on some, some of you're still waiting on your new ones. Um, I will, uh, I, I have a conversation today that hopefully, um, I will be able to announce next Thursday's expert. But on the 21st, definitely put that one in your calendars.

Uh, it is a tax planning. Expert. Um, he, uh, is very energetic, kind of like shouty used car salesman energy about taxes, which um, I think is a lot of fun. He's really well known, great speaker, breaks down complicated things very simply. And his firm does both the legal and the accounting side of tax planning and acquisitions.

And as a new owner, I don't think we can get, uh, more like tax strategy, I think is one of the best things [01:13:00] you can start learning. If you've been in a W2, you don't have a lot of tools that you can use. But as a business owner, there's only seven pages of the thousand pages of the tax code that tell you what you must pay.

There's 993 pages that tell you how to save money outta your taxes. And typically that's through business ownership, right? So we can never learn enough about this, but when you do an acquisition, there is a tax event, uh, that can be pretty dramatic depending on how you're buying. So he's gonna be talking about all that on the 21st.

Um, so yeah. That's all I have for today. Um, any questions or anything before we sign off? 

**Michael:** Uh, one quick question, Athena, I, I apologize to the group if I'm, I'm the new guy and gonna keep people late asking a question at the end. But, um, the find, not the financial modeling template, but the, um, financials that you looked at and you converted them into your template, I, I'm assuming those are anonymized or a fake, you know, from fake financials.

Is that right? If, and if so, could you [01:14:00] share that? Um, we, I could run through the exercise of putting 'em in the template myself or even the messy one that you didn't go through, assuming that it's not an active. Legitimate company or has it been anon is, is anonymous data or whatever. So I dunno if that was something we could do.

I feel like 

**Athena:** there's homework on your dashboard with some anonymous financial statements. Um, okay, I'll go look again. Yeah, this, this one's not anonymized, but that's good. So Edita, let's look into that and see if we can get some more anonymized examples for people to start messing around with. Um, so yeah, Michael, we can get that over to you.

Um, this one in particular is not anonymized and it's, um, yeah, completely understand all sorts of watermarks. All if it's proprietary data 

**Michael:** or real data, I wouldn't wanna Yeah, understand. Yeah, I don't, 

**Athena:** I don't mind throwing it up. But we, we can absolutely anonymize some more and give it to you if you want some more practice.

So leave that with us. We'll get that over in a couple days. I never think you can get enough practice, so it's, 

**Michael:** it's no, I mean, not a problem. I could probably mock something up as well, but I just wanted to, I thought if it was [01:15:00] already done, maybe I could leverage it, but yeah. 

**Athena:** Yeah, we, it's pretty easy for us to get some more of those over to you, so we'll do that for sure.

**Federico:** Yeah. Thank you. 

**Athena:** Well, great to see you all had fun today. I'll see you next week. Have a great weekend in the meantime, and we'll see you soon. Bye. Take care. Bye.
