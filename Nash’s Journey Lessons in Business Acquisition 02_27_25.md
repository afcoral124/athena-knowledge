# AcquiMatch Buyers Club 02/27/25

[00:00:00] 



**Athena:** Hello. Hello. Welcome. Welcome. Hey, how's it going? Steve is here too. Hi, amazing. Um, so welcome to fire. So Nash is running a little bit behind. So I wanted to see if Gil, you just had a really interesting deal that you worked through on customer concentration. And I thought it was a good learning opportunity for us to just have a quick discussion about customer concentration and, um, Before Nash joins us, would you be willing to share a little bit about the deal you looked at and what you learned or how you felt about customer concentration?

Sorry to put you on the spot. 

**Gil:** Um, so it was a IT consulting firm. 

**Athena:** It's a little bit hard to hear you. I don't know if there's a, 

**Gil:** uh, how about now? 

**Athena:** That's a little bit better. Yeah. 

**Gil:** Okay. Uh, I'll speak up. [00:01:00] Uh, it was an IT consulting firm. Uh, out of, uh, Nevada. And, uh, they had one client, which was the Clark County School District.

Um, and, uh, that was their only client, and it's been their only client since their inception. Uh, the reason this was their only client was, sorry, go back. The owner of the company used to be the CIO of the Clark County School District, so he had personal relationships there. Uh, as a result, he stepped out after after, he was an interim CIO, he stepped out.

And he started this firm in order to provide them services for an ERP program called PeopleSoft. And that's all he did. He only had, he only did PeopleSoft. He didn't do anything else for them. When I asked why, he said it because it wasn't really kosher because he was their CIO, and he had an inside job, an inside, uh, way into it.

And he didn't, he didn't do it. He just did the PeopleSoft stuff. Um, so there are two single points [00:02:00] of failure here. Uh, one single point of failure was only one, only one client, and the other was only one technology. So if they decided to move off of PeopleSoft onto SAP, uh, who knows if they'll stick with this company.

Uh, and if they don't renew, and the contract was renewed every year. Uh, so that was another point, what happens if they don't renew it? And it wasn't project based either. Uh, it was basically staff og at this point. And in addition to all of that, the owner has another IT consulting firm in Nevada that does everything else.

So he's, when I was talking to him about this, he said, yes, you can have all the education and you can have all the education stuff. I'll do everything else. So he's also limiting me to what I can actually access and do. So all those reasons together, um, decided against going with that deal. 

**Athena:** Yeah, good call on that.

[00:03:00] So, um, and thanks for sharing Gil. I think the single points of failure are really important to talk about because sometimes they're perceived single points of failure. In this case, it was, you know, one decision maker, one customer, but in a lot of instances, it can appear like, oh, gosh, there's customer concentration in this business.

But when you look under the hood, and that's why it's good, you know, to look under the hood on these things, um, like, for example, I looked at a print shop that if you just looked at the brand name of the customers, it was one franchise group, but actually, it was like. A hundred different customers within this franchise group that had all different budgets.

They were different decision makers. So unless the franchise group themselves was like, they're not following our rules. And like, so that is a potential, but when you have one brand, but multiple decision makers with separate [00:04:00] budgets, then then that can, you know, overcome some of the risk of. You know, the difference between 1 person who has 1 budget and you're, you're getting 1 paycheck from 1 person as opposed to getting checks from a bunch of different people.

So, when you have something like a school, just for example, we're like, well, do each of the schools have a different budget? Is it different people at each of those schools? Is there multiple checks coming in versus. One check from the same school district and then that is definitely a risk, especially if that's the only customer in the business.

Um, so I wanted to pull out your example because I think it's a good learning exercise for everybody. Like when we see that customer concentration thing or a single point of failure, as you, as you said, right? Like, if it seems like there's one thing going on. We want to dive a little bit deeper. So another related example, Ryan and I talk about this a lot, but, um, Amazon businesses, you know, and I'm like, I [00:05:00] don't like single channel.

And he's like, but there's ways that you can overcome the risks. So we like having that kind of internal dialogue as well. And obviously every business is going to be, um, dependent on, on their situation, right? So there's ways to overcome. Risk if we know what the risk is, so I think the 1st point is identifying and, you know, then verifying what, what, what that assumption is.

So we see things and see if Sims or broker say something, or you hear something on the call and it's like, I don't like that. And it's like, okay, well, here's an opportunity for us to learn. And so then ran on said in his call. It was like, it's there's no cost to learn. There's no cost to have a conversation, right?

So it gives us an opportunity to learn and look under the hood. And, um, you know, with the customer concentration thing, like Lindsay and Kevin on the media company, we're able to build in a forgivable performance based note [00:06:00] attached to that customer concentration. Because it was, it was a risk, but it was like, well, if that customer goes away and we don't have that revenue anymore, then that portion of the note is going to be forgiven.

So it actually protected the overall upside. So it sounds like Nash is here, but I just wanted to pull that out. So that was a really good. Um, overview, Gil, it sounds like an interesting one for you to look at businesses that are in your wheelhouse with the I. T. consulting, um, but still a little bit curious.

And I might pull that out from you next time to hear a little bit more about, like, why are the different businesses and stuff? So, uh, good job investigating that 1, um, Nash. I think you might be here. I heard you might be in the, the waiting room. 

**Nash:** I'm here. I'm 

**Athena:** so excited to see you. It's been a minute, actually, since I've seen your face.

So, um, y'all Nash, let me give you a little introduction here and a little background. So [00:07:00] Nash and I got connected when we were both looking at buying businesses and in communities that were doing so. And he was my very first accountability buddy. On doing this stuff and like back then it was like, okay, you're going to watch this course month one month two, you're going to find a business and month three, you're going to close on a business.

So we were all like, yeah, it's been three months. So it was like this, this crazy kind of, uh, you know, what we were being sold versus the reality of it. And Nash has. One of the coolest ways of approaching problem sets and challenges and the way he strategically makes decisions, but also executes and takes action as something that I have just been very happy that I've been witness to because it's, uh, a inspiration to me and he's pushed me on a lot of things throughout the last couple of years.

It's actually helped me in my own journey. [00:08:00] It was his push to me to start looking on market, uh, that I actually found the, the big group, you know, property management deal that, that ended up changing my life. So, um, Nash ended up buying quite a sizable business. That was real estate involved. I'm going to let him tell you the specifics, but, um, the way he approached the whole acquisition and documented it was pretty phenomenal.

But then the taking it over and the way he approached taking it over and. Making it his own and the challenges that came up along the way were pretty amazing. So Nash, um, all the folks here are actively trying to buy businesses right now. And when I was asking, I'm like, what would you like to learn from?

They're like, we want to hear from people that have been at it for like a year, year and a half. And some of the stories we've shared about what, like what's gone on, I think are so interesting. So I'm really excited you're here to talk about your journey. Um, and. [00:09:00] Yeah, just thank you so much for being here.

**Nash:** Of course. Thanks for the nice introduction. 

**Athena:** So, Nash, if you want to kick us off, tell us where you are, what you bought and then I might have us like, just go back a little bit to before you bought the business. 

**Nash:** Sure. So, physically, I'm in Portland, Oregon. Um, I bought a transmission repair shop after looking for, I don't know, 6 months or something.

Um, and looking at, you know, 50 plus businesses and when I mean, look, I mean, you know, drive right along with concrete trucks, go on, follow around painting companies, that sort of thing. Uh, so I bought the business and I bought the real estate as well. I didn't initially want both, but. The prior owner wanted to be just done with everything and wanted it to be a [00:10:00] package and that ended up working out really well.

Um, in the end, it was just a much bigger, you know, double the price tag. So I was just a little nervous in that respect, but it ended up being a lot, you know, the way that the deal terms changed ended up being really beneficial in the end. So I'm really happy that that that happened. 

**Athena:** So cool. We're actually going to have one of our own members.

He's a commercial real estate. I don't want to call him guru, but an expert come and talk about commercial real estate next week, um, and how it can fit into the deal. And that was like a big aspect of yours and how you made that work. But before you found this business, like, talk us through a little bit about, like.

You know, when pre pre business owner who were you what, what were you doing? Why did you decide to go after buying a business in the 1st place? 

**Nash:** Yeah, sure. I, uh, I was working in the corporate world. I was in the semiconductor industry, um, particularly working for LAM research. Um, [00:11:00] I was in global operations.

I had a 33 person team in supply chain and doing some product development stuff. And that was basically responsible for stuff all over the world, like a billion dollars or worth of material, like custom design material that we would source from around the world. And so there was just fires all the time and ended up having 2 kids and I was previously traveling like 70 percent of the time, which was fine before kids and, you know, it was just getting a little exhausting and it was fun.

Fun for a period of time, but kind of was ready to settle down and try something new and the corporate world wasn't going to really allow for that. Not just the physical presence, but the mental and emotional presence as well. Being able to be there for my wife and my family. So I was looking 2020 because travel came to a halt.

[00:12:00] Way too many time way too much time to think. So I was just trying to figure out what I could do instead of the corporate life, but still, you know, provide financially for my family. So I was looking into lots of real estate or different things. Real estate kind of wasn't, um, wasn't going to do it financially, but also just wasn't enough activity for me.

You know, I don't want to just sit around at home. And so I figured out businesses, you know, trade for a much lower. Multiple of cash flow than real estate, right? 2 to 4 times as opposed to like, 20 to 30 times or whatever. Um, you know, and and you get to you get to some people don't don't want to or think they can passively manage it.

But, um, basically, you know, you have to have to be involved. I think, or I've learned over. My year and a half, uh, to make it successful. So definitely bought a job [00:13:00] and a business at this point. But, um, it's been really rewarding. It's been given me the time freedom that I want. I still work very hard, but I'm home when I want to be home.

I'm not, you know, I'm checked out when I'm home. I don't need to do anything or answer emails or be on conference calls or stressed about something that an executive is going to come down on me for. You know, there's periods of time that do get stressful. Like, last year, we had a nice storm come through and a bunch of the pipes 1st year.

So I was, you know, driving through the ice where nobody else was driving to come fix all the pipes. So we could open back up. Right? So there's like, peak stress and then, you know, you solve the problem and it goes back down and, you know, you're good again. As opposed to like, I think corporate world designs high stress perpetually, which is, is not sad.

Where's he down? So, 

**Athena:** yeah, I, um, 1 of the, the things I'll, I'll never forget [00:14:00] when you were like, I don't know, a month or 2 into the business and we're all like, how's it going? And you're like, you know. Um, can't remember exactly what you said, but it was just something like, I, I get to, you know, shut off at the end of the day and go be with my family.

Like, and that's what I wanted, you know, and with, with your previous job, because of the global nature of your team and stuff, it was just like getting messages. All the time and, you know, having to be always on and not really be able to just be present with your family and the ability to be able to do that was kind of the whole reason that you did this in the 1st place.

**Nash:** Yeah, 

**Athena:** yeah, 

**Nash:** and you know, that's not always the case, right? I might be thinking about it, but it's not like I'm not answering worried about answering to somebody or something like that, which I think can bring a lot of pressure in certain environments. It's just answering to myself and whether I'm happy with where we're at.

So, [00:15:00] 

**Athena:** yeah, um, I, I was just talking with, um. Lindsey over the weekend, and she's like, I'm stressed, but it's a different kind of stress because I'm the one sitting around the table coming up with the solutions instead of somebody else telling me what to do with me. Not like that. 

**Nash:** Right? 

**Athena:** Yeah. Yeah, so you so I want to talk about that.

I store in a little bit because I think you glossed over it, but it was like, quite a major thing that you went through. Um, but before we get to that, are you comfortable kind of sharing some metrics around. Your deal, and I think what was particularly interesting is that you use a pair of pursue and you were the 1st person that I even learned that from.

**Nash:** Yeah, so essentially the total deal size is about 6, 6. 1M, um, used SBA financing through live Oak. The real estate was just under 3M and the business was just over 3M. Um, and so [00:16:00] to combine the 2, 1, the SBA 7A loan cap is 5 mil, right? So it was over that. So Live Oak did a Perry Pursue loan, meaning like matched terms for the difference.

And that was 1 part of it to go over the cap, right? So you're not completely dead in the water. They have to like the deal and there's like, they have to match terms for the SBA and stuff for it to go. But that was that was good. The other thing was that, um. The real estate being greater than 50 percent of the financing allowed the term to or the amortization term to be pushed from, you know, max of 10 years for businesses to 25.

now, if you caught what I said, the business was just over 50%. The real estate was just under 50%. Well, the bank basically did some creative stuff and put the, um, Um, [00:17:00] Equity injection, so what I put down, plus what the seller put down, so my 5%, and the seller had a note of 5%, basically making up the 10 percent minimum.

They put that towards essentially the business side, if you will. So it took it from, you know, 3. down to just under, so that the real estate loaned allocation was 3. 3 million. You know, I guess a little bit of fudging numbers, but under 50 percent or over 50%. Sorry. Um, and that allowed the turn to go all the way out to 25 years, which greatly helps cash flow.

Um, just making a lower payment each month. So my DSCR is like over three, um, not just because of that, because it was a great price as well, but helped out substantially. So, 

**Athena:** yeah, your multiple was pretty phenomenal. If I remember correctly, if you're comfortable sharing. 

**Nash:** Yeah, [00:18:00] so, uh, over a year and a half, but essentially it was a 1.

9 or something. Multiple cashflow, so got it quite favorably and there was a bunch of different offers, um, for the business, but I was chosen. I kind of had looked at so many things. I was ready to jump on an opportunity and I was just looking on biz by sell 1 day and it popped up and I was, I could tell immediately like, Hey, I think this there's something here.

So I was just really aggressive with the broker. We went and saw the place like that day or the next day, um, and I had an offer written up that I was like, okay, if I like it. I'm going to hand it to him. I did some research before meeting them and seeing the place on the owner. I was able to find him through the reviews and figure out who he was.

And he was a [00:19:00] big golfer. So I brought him a box of golf balls. That was like 35. And I swear that me dropping a few, you know, I was watching YouTube or whatever on how to what transmissions are, what they're made up of, right? I'm not don't have that background. So I dropped a few. Comments of like, Oh, that's a planetary gear and blah, blah, blah, whatever.

And so he's like, okay, at least this guy kind of knows something about the place versus like private equity. Right. Um, and give him the golf balls and the offer at the end. And I swear that golf balls got me the deal. I'm sure they had private equity offers that were much higher. It was, I was definitely late to the game, but he wanted somebody to carry it on, be here for the team and, you know, not just.

Managed from afar. So 

**Athena:** I love that story and I want to pull out a few things that we can talk about a lot now. Right? Like, so Nash had done [00:20:00] 50 ride alongs, right? Like, had looked under the hood deeply specifically, right? spoken to gone along to like, every time I was talking to him, he's like, I'm riding in a like cement truck today, or I'm going on a, like, what was, there was like a tree care business at one point.

I mean, there was all sorts of things, but he was actually going and physically meeting these people and getting an idea of like, what will my life be like in this business? So he'd done that so many times that he was like. New the language was ready to go knew how to model and offer and then he physically went to go meet this man.

So that is an exceptional way to build rapport with somebody. And then the golf balls, like, thinking about them, showing them that you see that they're human. And you're thinking about that and doing some research so you can go and try and speak their language like there's so much gold in that talk track that he just, you know, had in terms of going and meeting this guy and and we need to balance a good offer [00:21:00] with, you know, also building reports, kind of like both of those things, like, if he would have just sent.

That offer without going and meeting this guy and sending golf balls. I can't imagine that he would have been chosen over private equity that we're delivering a lot more. 

**Nash:** Yeah, for sure. 

**Athena:** Um, so, okay. So when you were looking at this deal and there was real estate involved, um, you actually had some real estate background.

So you knew kind of a lot more than, than, uh, most folks. But you said you didn't want the real estate. So what ended up changing your mind about it? 

**Nash:** Uh, so I just didn't want it because the doubling the price tag to six instead of three. I was like, Oh, maybe, you know, I didn't know if I had enough money, frankly.

Um, and so I was just like, gave him an offer for just the business and they [00:22:00] came back and they said they really wanted to do both. So, you know, you're, they were like, He likes you, you're one of whatever, uh, three they're reviewing out of the whole gambit, but, you know, the other two will take the real estate.

And I said, fuck it. Just throw it in there. I'll make it work. Um, and so that doubled my equity injection from like, 150 or 170 to 3, 20, 40, whatever. So, and I scrounged up, uh, The money somehow, I don't even remember how, but, um, you know, that, that was pretty much why, but it ended up, you know, in the first couple of months, just being able to pay yourself rent, like, comes back pretty quick, as long as it's for the right price, so.

**Athena:** Yeah, you want to make sure that the, the real estate itself is valued correctly. Um, but also being able to extend the totality of the payments over 25 [00:23:00] years, as opposed to buying a 3Million dollar business. That is, you know, doing 1 and a half. I'm just using, like, if it's a 2X multiple 100, 1. 5Million a An SDE or adjusted EBITDA and having to pay those loan payments over 10 years versus paying those loan payments over 25 years and you would've had to pay rent anyway.

So was there a big swing between the rent payment and the mortgage payment? 

**Nash:** So, let's see, 3 million for 10 years at 9% is 38,000 a month. 6 million over 25 years. Is 50, 000, so essentially 12, 000 more, um, and they had valued the rent because they essentially were paying themselves something, but they put it in, you know, kind of corrected it to market rate or whatever at 25, 000 a month.

Okay, so simple math 

**Athena:** paying half the rent you would have had to pay and you [00:24:00] own the real estate. 

**Nash:** Right? Yeah, 

**Athena:** pretty 

**Nash:** cool. And that extra, you know, 1213 a month, just based on that. Simple math. 

**Athena:** Yeah. So, um, okay. I, I, uh, want to definitely make sure we spend some time on what happened next. So, like, I remember you even talking about how you prepared for day 1.

so a lot of people are thinking about, like, what's the transition look like? What should I be preparing for last week? We heard from an on actually who came on and I don't know if I've updated you on the latest with him, but it. He was looking at losing his house at one point, right? So a lot that's happened since that story.

So, um, talk us through day one. How did you prepare for it? What did, what did that look like? And then how did you approach the transition? 

**Nash:** Yeah, so the owner really didn't want to introduce me until [00:25:00] day one, which I get, um, my wife thought that was the weirdest thing ever. I'm like, well, you know, imagine you're in their shoes and they just have the, what, you know, knowing or meeting some guy before it happens.

Um, so he wouldn't let me do that. So we spent a few days at the play at the shop, basically on the weekends where he was, like, showing me how things worked and. You know, the 1st meeting we went through every, every employee in great detail. So it's starting to get to know them and the nuances. And you think you're prepared, but the employees are the biggest curveball employees and right people employees and customers can be the biggest curveballs day to day, which is just true everywhere.

Um, but I went from 33 in my previous life down to now. I have 11. so, um, but it just depends on you have. Uh, anyways, different topic, um, they gave me access to the [00:26:00] security cameras. So I could, like, watch all day. Like, what does everybody do? How do things flow? That sort of thing. So just trying to get familiar with, you know, what happens day to day, just watching the people and moving things around and whatnot.

And then day 1, we just basically prepared, you know, me to come in right after the holiday. It was Labor Day. We closed on August 30th and started on Tuesday after Labor Day. I think it was, I was actually out of town. So we had delayed it and I signed the documents remotely. Um, you know, big stack with, uh, whatever the lady is that comes in the notary, um, and we went in and just started introducing myself to people.

Certain people, the owner went, like, met with them the day before, so they weren't caught off guard. And other people is like, oh, they'll be fine. We'll just. Do an intro like face to face right then and there. Um, so he had prepped like three key people. [00:27:00] Um, and that, you know, still, you know, hit them in various ways and they had their own, you know, it's a big change.

Um, we didn't I plan to do a speech that day, but we didn't end up doing it. The owners really. Gun shy of even talk what you talking to his employees other than like coordinating operations. He really didn't do any feedback or anything. So we were just like, I was chasing him around all day watching what he did.

Um, and by day 3, I think the employees were really uncomfortable. So I was like, Cory is the old owner's name. We got to get them together and have an all hands like, you know, their minds are racing. You know, people were talking about leaving because they heard another shop got bought and then it was resold and then blah, blah, blah.

So I just needed to introduce who I was and that nothing was going to change and I'm just here [00:28:00] to learn. And that's why I'm following him around, blah, blah, blah, to at least help ease their minds a little bit. Um, and I think that helped, but, you know, everybody has their own time frame of, uh, adapting to change.

So some people took probably 6 plus months or whatever. Some people never got over it, and they're no longer here for, you know, because of me or because of them, and that's fine too. Um, but I tried not to change anything for the first 90 days based on some book. I forget which one it was, but, uh, I did have to let somebody go after, like, 60 days that just wasn't working and was making other employees really angry that he wasn't working as hard as them.

And the old owner would do a really good job of keeping them separate. Different sides of the shop, but I just wasn't babysitting that closely and probably was a good thing that I just [00:29:00] got got it over with. Um, but yeah, so it was definitely something that I should have just done day 1, but waited a few days.

I 

**Athena:** was going to ask you about that because I remember you planned it. Um, so going back, you would have been no, Cory, I'm doing it today. Like, so that's that's a takeaway for folks. It's like, day 1, you got to alleviate concerns, introducing yourself, tell them your strategy, which is I'm not changing anything.

I'm here. I want to make your lives good. Like, um, what was the content of that speech and and would you have changed it now? And in hindsight. What things would you have made sure you included? 

**Nash:** I just told him who I was and where I was coming from. And that, you know, I'm not everybody kept asking, like, what shop did you come from?

Like suppliers? Everybody would say, like, who is this guy? I didn't come from the automotive world. You know, I did work on [00:30:00] cars and bikes and I was a kid with my dad and. Was just looking for something to get back to, you know, working with my hands a little bit. I came from the corporate world. I have an engineering degree and that just wasn't working out for me and my family.

And so I'm trying something new and I'm here to support them and I'm not going to just. You know, destroy the business or change drastic things in the business, and I'd like to know what you guys value from the business and how Corey ran things because it's already successful. I don't need to change anything.

You know, we can make things better maybe over time, but not until I learn what works and doesn't work from you guys. And so, you know, I think just the basic things and starting the dialogue helps and then it doesn't stop there. I mean, it continues and you got to check in with everybody. Um. Then it gets kind of weird at points, but I don't know, you know, it's a constant thing.

So 

**Athena:** do you mind elaborating in generalities about why [00:31:00] it gets weird or what what things people should prepare for? Because I think that's not something that's talked about enough is like the employees. The culture, the fact that it is very different at this level than in corporate. Right? Yeah. 

**Nash:** Yeah. So corporate, I mean, there's difficult people.

I had very difficult people in corporate land. Um, but, uh, here, they're really not afraid of just coming up and slamming a door open and be like, what the fuck is going on? And that's pretty normal or was like accepted, you know, or people would scream at each other. Right. Um, and that, like, really surprised me a few times, which, you know, I don't know, maybe you could just see people coming or it's on a conference call.

So it's less like abrupt in corporate land. But, um, you know, there's like, big, giant men, you know, that tower over you sometimes. So it's like, holy shit. Okay. Um, so you just got to [00:32:00] get used to that. And like, those people are not here anymore either. So, You know, it was, like, kind of not out of the norm for the team, but, like, that person who was the most abrasive, um, I would say was, like, one of the highest performers, so everybody was kind of like, oh, that's Virgil, and he's an asshole, but, like, you know, I know he does a really good job, so.

You know, we just have to like work around it. And that was kind of how it used to be forever. And I just got kind of tired of it. And I'm like, you know, I didn't come here to make the most money. I came here to change my life. That was the main reason. So it's not working out. And it took me way too long to come to that realization.

Um, like a year, but you know, people think, how is that business going to succeed without that one person? Well, You [00:33:00] know, we're doing probably better than we ever have now and we don't have certain people who are really dragging the culture down now. Is it perfect? No. Um, but is it a lot better? Absolutely.

So, um, yeah, it took me a really long time to kind of weed those folks out because I was worried about hiring really, really specialized labor. And what that would do, and what the other guys would think, and blah, blah, blah. I did start training, trying to up level people. But, you know, these are really skilled, talented individuals.

So, I was kind of scared about that. But we did it, and I think we're doing, doing really well. And everybody's a lot happier. In fact, some of my other employees came up to me and was like, I didn't realize how bad it was until, you know, they were gone.

Yeah, [00:34:00] you always you're very lonely as you're very lonely as the owner operator, but sometimes you just gotta take action to see what works. It doesn't work. 

**Athena:** Can you say more about that? Because we were talking about that with Renan to, like, the isolation of being. An owner, like, what do you mean by that?

It means it's very lonely. 

**Nash:** And you're, you're the one, you're the guy or the girl, um, that has to figure it out, right? Even talking to my wife, like, she had no idea what I'm talking about. She'll give me her opinion, but unless people have been there or done that, you know, it's kind of, you know, just an opinion.

It doesn't really come with any experience or helpfulness, unfortunately, even though I hear her out. Um, you know, there's going to be really bad days that and those days might last for weeks or months. And, you know, [00:35:00] like I said, it's not the same stress, but, you know, you want it to change. You want to get better because you're responsible for everything.

It's not like you can just tune out and just whatever. I'm going to zone out this call or this meeting today because I don't feel like it. Yeah, you can, you can leave or you can stop working. It's hard, but you, you know, you notice that it's not going to work as well when you do that. Right? Because it's yours.

So, uh, yeah, I don't know. It is nice talking with other business owners. Um, one of my friends here owns an electrical company and it's like, yeah, I got this employee problem bottle. I was like, yeah, me too. I just had 3 people call out sick today. I was like, oh, man, you beat me. I only had 2, you know, it's just like last minute.

So just little things like that. Like, it's not a normal. Um, you just have to, [00:36:00] uh, surround yourself with people in the same situation, which there's very few of us. Um, generally speaking, that own businesses out there, you know, when you go to a block party or something and you say, oh, yeah, I left corporate world and I bought an auto shop, but I look at you and then kind of like, walk away or change the subject.

And I think that would be, like, the most interesting person at that whole thing. You know, the normal person doesn't think that so 

**Athena:** great. Yeah, we're wired a little bit differently to be trying to do this and doing this. So. Um, I was going to ask and you kind of rounded about the answer, like, when you feel isolated and alone and.

Like, how do I do this? How do you get yourself out of those tough days, tough weeks, tough months? Like, how do you decide to make decisions or what's your process look like to figure those things out or get yourself through it?

**Nash:** Depends on [00:37:00] the problem. I guess I'm a pretty, I just like defining and trying to solve problems very, um. Matter of factly, I think that's a lot of fun, even if it's like a, a challenging thing. Um, but I honestly listened to Layla and Alex a lot. I think that even if they're not talking about something that, uh, is.

Um, like, exactly what I have to do with. They're just like, have a lot of energy in their voice, which recharges myself, you know, me, um, you know, but I don't know, there's no, there's no method to the madness. You go through kind of slumps of having the energy and and not, but if you can rally the team together.

And get some buy in the energy really ends up flowing if you're working uphill and don't have any buy in from anybody. It's going to be [00:38:00] really draining. You know, everybody wants to be a part of a team. Even even the person at the top. 

**Athena:** I love that. So, for those of you that aren't familiar, Layla and Alex are Layla and Alex from Mosey.

Um, they're kind of. But I definitely was just listening to Layla last night, you know, like she, her, she's very much like leadership and, um, culture and Alex is very much like sales and marketing and they're actually married and have had a couple exits and run a business now, which is a family office, essentially.

But give away all their kind of like information and expertise for free. So, um, they both have their own independent podcasts, which is really awesome. Like, so if you're like, I need sales and marketing or just to kick up the ass and you go to Alex, if you're like, I'm really struggling right now with culture and operations and hiring people and scaling, you go to Layla.

So, you know, you come for Alex, you stay for Layla is what I say. But on the point that you were just [00:39:00] saying, like getting buy in from the team, like, Do you have an example of how you, when you recognized that you needed to do that and, and how you did it, 

**Nash:** the employees like having to get rid of some employees volume 

**Athena:** and make 'em feel like, oh yeah, you were just talking about like when they feel like, you know, part of a team or when you, when you wanna get them, like, bought into something.

Like how did you recognize that and or approach it to make that happen? 

**Nash:** Uh. So, I guess I would, I just re, listen to, um, the email. Have you guys read or heard about that? About, and they have, he has this thing about, like, the 3 different, uh, 3 different hats, you wear the technician, the manager, and then, like, the entrepreneur.

And I find myself bouncing through the 3 a lot. Um, [00:40:00] I need to spend more time in the manager space. And what I mean, specifically by that is like, helping the team develop on their own and like, talking to them. They're so focused on working. You know, if they don't have stuff to do with a car, they'll just like, mop or like, clean or, you know, whatever.

And they're just like, constantly working. So I feel bad, like, interrupting them. Okay, let's go talk about, like, your goals and aspirations and stuff. But every time I do force them to think about it. Um, you know, we both jump out of the meeting. Like, I think feeling feeling good and better. And, you know, like.

They understand me, I understand them, and so I need to create some more time for that. I just, I have a guy that doesn't speak a lot of English, she's from Mexico, and I had somebody help translate, and I said, you know, I know you've been here a year. I know you want to raise, um, Why don't you think [00:41:00] about what goals you have for yourself this year?

Come back and tell me next week, which is this week. And, you know, let's talk about them and align on them. And these are goals for yourself. Like, what do you, you have these skills, your work this proficiently, like, where do you want to get to by the end of the year? And if we can, you can share that with me, we'll talk about, you know, increasing your compensation and, you know, we ended the meeting and whatnot.

He went out. He was talking to the other guys, which I wish he wouldn't, but he did. And I was like, so what did, what did he think of the meeting? And he's like, oh, he was really excited about it. He, you know, he was really impressed that, you know, you want to talk about goals and his development and he's like, really excited about that.

And he's not worried about not getting a raise right at the moment and blah, blah, blah. So like, oh, great. So, um, you know, I guess just not getting too caught up in the operations like I do. Um, and [00:42:00] making sure you're splitting time between those different hats is super important. Uh, otherwise you'll kind of get caught up in the grind.

**Athena:** Absolutely. Um, so I want to go back to, like, the 1st, 90 days you said, you know, I tried not to change anything for the 1st, 90 days, uh, but I had to let someone go on the, like, 60 days in. So what did the 1st, 90 days look like in your conceptually versus reality? And. Would you have changed anything or done anything different?

**Nash:** I had no idea what to expect, but we kind of made up a plan of like, Hey, I'm going to follow all the lunar around for two weeks. Now stop just shadow by his side. Um, and he would basically drive cars around seeing if they're broken or fixed. Order parts while he was walking around and also, like, coordinate telling everybody what to do while he was doing all of this.

So, like, you [00:43:00] know, being a technician diagnosing and doing cars, helping with sales on the phone parts ordering on the phone. And then, like. Managing all at the same time and by the second week, I said, okay, let me like, try to do some of this with you following me and or telling me what to do. So I can like, you know, put my training wheels on.

So we did that. And then after the 2nd week, I said, okay. I don't want you to come in this week or come in like 3 days or something. He's like, okay. And so he came and I think every other day, and then by the 4th week, I was like, just be on call, like, go away. Um, and, you know, things didn't run as smoothly or anything like that, but we were just trying it out and see what worked or didn't work.

And I would call him all the time asking him little questions, you know, [00:44:00] throughout those days, but, you know, the best thing to do is just try and learn. And I'm still, uh, so, yeah, we kind of figured it out. There were certain things that people weren't happy with and how they were working, or they were getting dropped or whatever.

And we had to address that just on the spot. But, yeah, then, so one of the things that I did drop was like certain little nuances of how he would walk around and manage, right? He would keep certain people separate or keep, you know, certain little nuances of each person and so their stress levels rose and some tempers outbursts and stuff like that.

And particularly one guy had been here for a very long time, just wasn't very motivated to work. So if I wasn't on top of and knowing like, okay, he's gonna be done in 15 minutes and I was out doing something else. And he got done, he would just stand there and do nothing or go, you know, get some water or whatever.

And all the guys knew he wasn't working. The rest of them would just like, go find [00:45:00] something to do. And so that really, uh, pissed some people off. And they basically said, hey, it's him or me. And I already knew that I didn't like the, not that I didn't like him personally, but he wasn't a good fit because I wasn't going to be that person to like micromanage him.

Um, having been in the job for 30 years, that wasn't a problem. Skills thing. It was a motivation thing. And so I, I let him go said, Hey, I'm breaking my 90 day rule thing. I got to keep the team. I want together, even though, you know, there was the threat of a really good guy leaving. It was, you know, something I knew I had to do anyway.

So. That was that. Um, they say not to change anything major. That's advice I've gotten just so you don't make any change before you realize how things actually work. But people might be 1 of those things. You have to make an exception for. 

**Athena:** [00:46:00] Yeah. So did it have a huge major impact? Or were you guys? Okay.

After that. 

**Nash:** Totally fine. Um, yeah, totally fine. Didn't have to worry about it. Certain people were actually upset that I did let him go just because he had been there for so long and then kind of got over it after a couple of days. So there's just been no change the team for, like, 15 years, 

**Athena:** right? 

**Nash:** So, you know, for the better or worse.

And so it was a shock that I had made that decision, but it also told the team, like, hey, he is the boss now and he will make those decisions. Um, and I've had to keep making them and trying to learn more quickly, um, before people get hurt or something like that, too. We've had a few high school kids cycle through in the past year, and one of them slammed their head onto a lift and had to go to the ER, and I knew he was kind of not, you [00:47:00] know, that great.

Uh, but I kept them on until something bad happened and just recently I hired somebody in December and they were fired within a couple of weeks just because they had tendencies of moving the company backward instead of forward. Right? Break, you know, ran a car off a lift basically damaged. It didn't hurt anybody, but damaged it.

And then a few other instances of little issues. And I was like, look, can't have somebody risk getting hurt here. So after a couple of weeks, he was gone. 

**Athena:** Um, yeah, especially in your line of work where there's like, the insurance. Prices can go up dramatically, workers comp, like all that stuff when you have people working on things.

So having somebody that, that causes potential, you know, it's one thing when you're sitting at computers, it's another thing when there's physical, like, safety at [00:48:00] risk, you know, or like people's cars and things, you know. 

**Nash:** And I took that for granted. I was kind of letting everybody given too much leeway.

Right. But I'm not trying to make the decision too quickly, but learning how to make it much quicker, whether it's a good fit or not a good bet, um, helps keep everybody safe. 

**Athena:** Yeah. So the, the, the telling the owner not to come in, that was actually a deliberate choice. I remember you saying, because it was very hard for.

You to position yourself as the boss, you know, the employees were still treating him as the boss as the owner and it wasn't really allowing you to kind of get in there. Do you want to talk through? Did I capture it? Remember that? It's been a minute, but that's that's kind of why I remembered you being like, hey, why don't you go home?

So you could start to establish yourself as the owner because it was difficult to do it within there. 

**Nash:** Yeah, definitely told him not to come in so I could [00:49:00] learn the hard way essentially and they could start seeing me as the guy doing stuff because he's such a workaholic that he would, you know, go do stuff, even if I was like, busy for a 2nd, so it was learning the hard way essentially wait and see what broke or what wasn't working that call him for help and, you know, hopefully they wouldn't know that I would call him like, 30 times a day, but, you know, you have to do that to try and establish.

That you're, you're the guy. So, 

**Athena:** and when you were following him around, were you like creating or what was your process for kind of learning things from him? 

**Nash:** I was trying. Um, I guess there's so many details that it wasn't as. Easy as I thought it would be to do that during that time period. I was just trying to absorb as much as possible.

I did basically in the first 90 days implement a shop management dashboard. You know, [00:50:00] he would verbally communicate everything going on in the shop. I was like, look, there's no way I'm going to ever want, or going to get to that level of management, so we're going to use a system to supplement so I can get up to.

You know, Corey's level and so there's TVs all around the shop that I installed. They're kind of like, what is he doing? And, um, they're all hooked up to show like, hey, here's the next job. You don't have to wait for me to just go, like, pull the work instead of me pushing it to, like, he used to do. So I had to supplement how things used to work with systems so that we still operate.

Um, in a more efficient manner that I wanted to, you know, go forward with plus, like, he would remember everything in his head and I'm much more like, hey, let's document it somewhere. So we can always find it. And I know how to find anything in the system, but we got to put it somewhere. Um, so everything's in there.

So that's how things work [00:51:00] now. Um, so essentially took the basic process flow from what he would do, put it into a system of like, you know, either things are in diagnosis or ready for work in work or ready for quality check, you know, and that's what he, the major blocks. He used to do and I put into a system so that we could actually continue to operate without running around like crazy.

So, but as far as like detail processes, still honestly haven't documented that, right? It's a very much an artistic style of work, which is tough, right? And that's where you get really specialized labor, but. Um, so I'm still trying to figure that one out, 

**Athena:** but you at one point, we were talking a lot about culture and an opportunity to make the culture of your own, but it required some scary decision.

It's right to help like [00:52:00] clear the way for some new culture to come through. Do you want to talk about that? Uh, cause I think that was later down the line, maybe a year into it. And it was, you know, some big, big shifts in terms of what that looked like. 

**Nash:** Yeah. Um, I mean, that has a lot to do with. Um, so we had 10 people when I started to three, three major people are, are gone.

Right. Two, three veterans, you would say, um, are gone. Um, and there's a bunch of new people, um, that are, I guess, more culturally aligned with. Not only how I would like it to be what, but the team as well, the remaining team, and we started developing our values on a board whiteboard. [00:53:00] Um, I still think some of them think it's weird, but, you know, we wrote down, you know, here's what we want the new team to to be in to embrace.

And it's still a work in progress, but, um, selecting the right team goes a long way and just, you know, not having to force those values, but having them ingrained in, you know, the selection itself. So, and like I said, a lot of that was, there were 3 veterans, so that was scary, right? Can you still operate by prioritizing values?

And, you know, so far the answer is yes, and it can still be a better workplace. So. 

**Athena:** And, and to that point, when you were worried about, like, hey, there's these highly skilled people that are, are leaving for, you know, life reasons or need to leave. How do I replace that? And actually, you [00:54:00] know, then people were coming to you and both internally and externally, right?

Because they were, you know, either wanted, they were excited about the new energy and they wanted to step up or they were hearing about things. 

**Nash:** Yeah, I did hire a, um, recruiting company. I'd say the worst people came from that company. Um, my employees referred some people and also our suppliers from the industry, like, which, you know, here and send us people or, you know, honestly, 1 of the guys that used to be here, his neighbor, um, he referred, you know, so, um.

And we said no to a lot of people, um, but it was really nice. Once the word got out, people would find us. Um, and, you know, again, it's just. We got pretty lucky. We hired some people and I let them go pretty quick, just knowing they weren't a fit. Some not quick enough, but yeah, [00:55:00] I don't know, still, still a work in progress of trying to figure out how to, how to hire right the first time, but sometimes you should give it a try.

**Athena:** Hiring is hard and especially through recruiters. Like, we definitely have had that experience. Also, like, when your standards are so high and you have a very clear vision of what, what culture you want, what values that you want for somebody that's incentivized just to place, you know, they're kind of like, uh, you know, whatever.

I mean, it's almost like, at least in our experience, it's like, maybe your standards are too high. I'm like, they're not because it exists. I already have examples of what it looks like. So I want more of that, you know. Yeah. Yeah. Um, but that could be hard to outsource something as crucial and as personal as, you know, the, the culture and getting the right people.

And but I think I remember you saying, like, someone on the team was like, I want to learn more. I'm willing to, like, train up and step up. 

**Nash:** Yeah, we have we have somebody that. You know, was so we have, [00:56:00] um, we take transmissions out. We take them all apart and we rebuild them. There's text that take them out and put it back in.

And then there's text that take the transmissions that are out, take it apart into a million pieces and put it back together and we've trained people from. The remove and replace side over to the build side, which is like a huge step up. Um, and, you know, it's taken a while, but actually he's doing really, really well.

So it is possible. They all want to learn. Um, it's just at what point you allow them to like, it's like, what's the staircase of like knowledge set to learn right? There's. There's certain vehicles that are harder than others. There's, you know, jumping all the way to building is like a huge step up. So, in, like, a career for these guys.

So, um, but, yeah, everybody here that's remaining is willing to learn, trying new things, which is great, um, need to work on them. There's a little bit of, like, [00:57:00] competition, so need to work on, like, you know, yes, we can be competitive, but we also have to help each other. You know, there's a delicate balance because some competition is good.

**Athena:** Maybe a competition about helping each other, 

**Nash:** like, instead of I as 

**Athena:** the person that helps each other the most. Yeah, 

**Nash:** not a bad idea. Right. 

**Athena:** A little star chart, you know, like, did you help someone today?

Um, so you had, you've had some interesting experiences with customers. So you have a business it's, you know, it's, it's got Google reviews. People can go on and rate, you have customers coming in and, um. Doing jobs, so, like, uh, it's it's kind of scary sometimes, especially when you get difficult customers. I don't know if you're happy to speak to some or the 1 in particular moment that I'm thinking about.

I'm sure there's been more sense, but 

**Nash:** yeah, there's been a bunch. I mean, we'll just give you the gamut. Right? So [00:58:00] people have. Disappeared and sent us a letter saying, hey, we're, we want to sue you because you screwed something up. We've had people who, you know, we put their car up and we kind of working underneath in the front and they say, hey, you messed our brakes up in the back.

We had somebody come in and we fixed their car and they said, hey, you messed up the license plate on the front of my car. Right? So, like, you get all these, like, random torpedoes from any which way. Well, you know, on the little stuff are like. Yeah. You know, I don't know how we would have messed up the license plate, but we'll fix it.

It doesn't matter. The guy who wanted to sue for, like, for whatever thought we didn't do our job, basically, um, that was the worst. Oh, there's a couple instances actually, but. Anyway, the one, he disappeared. We said, Hey, we think this is a computer problem. We've replaced this transmission. Hey, but you also have a computer problem.

He disappeared and then says this letter saying, Hey, [00:59:00] I've spent, you know, this much money on computer work and I took it to this other shop and they replaced some little thing and they fixed your faulty transmission. And, you know, we didn't know about any of this. So I, I hired a attorney and said, Hey, how do I respond to this?

And they spent a couple thousand dollars, like going back and forth trying to, I just, you know, whatever. Um, that's, that sucks. I don't know the whole situation, but Hey, let me give you some money. Right. Um, refunding basically the money you spent on this other stuff that I know nothing about. And they didn't want that.

They wanted like a whole bunch more money. So like. Okay. Finally, the independent attorney said, Hey, why don't you talk to your insurance company? That's what they're for that. Therefore, I'm like, why didn't you tell me that when I first asked you, but sure. And so I submitted the claim to my business insurance policy, you know, policy, and I haven't heard a word since.

So I think that they probably just. [01:00:00] Oh, like his insurance is involved and they came down hard on them because there was a lot of inconsistencies. I was just trying to be nice and make it go away. Right? I don't need to fight a legal battle or something stupid, but they kept being pretty unreasonable about it.

And so I think that just went away, but it was very stressful during the time. My wife doesn't even know about all that. Um, another time we fix this guys. And then after we did that, we got calls from a bunch of shops saying like, Hey, this guy's like really shady. He screwed us blah, blah, blah. Sure enough, comes back.

We've like driven hours. He lives hours away. So we send people hours to pick up his truck, bring it back, fix it again. You know, little, little things. Um, and he's still not happy and he's like threatening to sue. And I'm just like, I don't know. I just give you all your money back. And he's like, great. You know, so he was just trying to get money back and you know, you can't keep every [01:01:00] customer.

We see hundreds of people a month. You can't. It's hard to sniff out the bad ones because they kind of hide it until they know they have you. Sometimes you just have to cut bait and, you know, go after the next one. So, the customer thing I try and let get to me less. We take what learnings we can from it and say, hey, you know.

Given the technical situation, is there anything better we could have done for this customer? Forget all their nuances and things, but, and there are some learnings, little stuff, but, you know, we do the best we can. We try and make and keep as many customers as we can, but you can't win them all. 

**Athena:** Yeah, um, I think I think that's definitely something that keeps me up at night.

Right? Because it's like, you want to win them all. If you're a good person and a good business owner, and, um, I don't know if you've, you've come [01:02:00] across Dan Martell yet, but his book, buy back your time has been a huge influence on me and just his philosophies around business. But. You know, we were talking about my fear of getting things wrong and he's like, I like he's like, you know, I don't mind getting things wrong because then I have an opportunity to show people who I am.

And I was like, oh, okay, and it just immediately, like, remove some of the, like, crippling fear around getting things wrong because it's like, if. You know, people are human, and you can do everything to your ability to get things right. But when you get it wrong, it's like, well, how do you respond? And and that shows a lot about character to, and it gives you an opportunity to show, like, hey, we care and we're going to try to fix this and do right by you.

And even the fact that you point out, it's a learning opportunity. You know what I'm saying? Like, it's, um. It's impossible to get it right. 100 percent of the time, especially when there's people out there that will take advantage of you and go around to all the shops and complain. So he never [01:03:00] has to pay for any of his repair work.

**Nash:** I know. Yeah, Layla calls it fucking around and find out, right? You're not going to know until you try. Keep getting better. 

**Athena:** Absolutely. So I want to, like, touch on what you said, like, you didn't think you were buying a job and, and I think it's, you know, a lot of people think. That you could be passive, even at the 1.

5M SDE adjusted EBITDA level, like, where you're at. So, you know, you said you're, you're in there and you're doing things probably more than you thought or wanted to, but so talk us through that. How do you feel about that? What do you wish you knew going into it? 

**Nash:** Well, I came from a community who, like, preached, um, buying and then kind of setting it up and being passive.

And so after buying it and being so involved, I felt kind of. Like I was failing at that and then after it took only almost a year [01:04:00] After yeah after reviewing like the year one financials. I was like, you know what if I would have like tried harder which i'm not Ashamed of doing I probably could have like helped this a lot more than I did just because I felt like I you know was supposed to like Start backing out of this business.

I was like, what am I going to do with my time anyway? Um, so I just this year pretty much I said screw it i'm gonna do the opposite and like try and um be At as involved not that i'm spending any more time here. It's just the time i'm spending here I'm being more trying to learn more myself about how things work because When I can learn about how it works, I can make it better So, um, I kind of said to hell with that thought process of being passive.

I don't know that [01:05:00] that is the right thing to do for buying businesses. Um. At least the 1 I'm in, uh, and kind of took the opposite approach and it's easy working really, really well. And look, you know, you may be able to do it. But I was not comfortable with the risk of the loan hanging over me. Um, and also, like, I'm not ashamed of being active.

And learning and being in the trenches, you don't want to be in the trenches forever. No, I mean, like I said, I'm in there to learn and then try and make it better, make it more system ties. But in order to system ties, you got to know what the hell is going on. So I find that as the next step. 

**Athena:** I love I love you sharing that and and particularly your emotions around it, you know, and and bear in mind.

This is the same community that told us we should have been able to close on a minute business within 3 months of joining the community, [01:06:00] you know, like, knowing nothing about how acquisitions worked as an individual. So just the timeline and the expectations weren't set for reality. But yeah, like the feeling like we did something wrong when we hadn't bought in three months and also the feeling of doing something wrong if, if you had to be actively involved in the business and the first year and realizing, well, gosh, there's a much longer, like much bigger upside for me to be involved now.

**Nash:** Right? 

**Athena:** Yeah. 

**Nash:** And I have had like. The itch to go after something else and people start into, like, hey, maybe he wants to buy this other 1, you know, and, um, but for me, I've got to get it to a place where it can operate without me just bailing and pulling out before I do that. Um, but it's motivation, right for the next goal.

You know, we've got to get there if we can. 

**Athena:** I think that's a good [01:07:00] marker because a lot of people think about, like, I could be a platform company and I go and buy other ones. And it's like, when you can leave the business and not break and it's still perform well, then then maybe you can consider getting another 1.

**Nash:** The, yeah, I mean, I had somebody reach out from that, the community, um, which I love talking to people, but they were like, hey, I want to talk because I want to buy, like, 20 of these things shops. Um, And like, roll them up into a whole code. Great. Great goal. Um, I said, how, you know, where are you at in the process?

Haven't bought any. Okay. How many have you seen that? Okay. Well, maybe start there, right? Because, um, I love the goal, but you got to take the 1st step. 

**Athena:** Yeah. And it might change your 

**Nash:** perspective a little bit. 

**Athena:** Yeah. And something you did that not a lot of people do is like those ride alongs that I'm [01:08:00] interested in this industry.

I'm going to go learn it. I'm going to go spend time in it. I'm going to see if it's an industry that I like, you know, and go and visit the owner and meet them and get my hands dirty. So, you know, you, you did more of those reps than anyone. I know, actually. And you did it in a very short time. So it's pretty phenomenal.

Um, so some, some random things have happened to you throughout this process, like the pipes bursting. Right? So, um, you, you were in a situation where there was literally no one else to go and fix. This problem, so this is 1 of those, like, really big examples of okay. Yeah, we all want to be like, passive or have a management layer in place or whatever.

You know, there's these things that were told, but, like, at the end of the day, if the pipes are bursting, like, who's going to fix it? So what did you end up having to do? 

**Nash:** [01:09:00] Uh, learning how to be a plumber, I don't know, went to Home Depot and got like all the supplies I figured I could need. I was like, crawling around in the roof, cutting copper pipe and soldering and, you know, fixes and it took a long time and they didn't hold every single time.

But I just figured it out. Kept turning it on. Is it holding? No. So, um, you know. The shop was closed because it was kind of a really rare, like, extreme event, but I wanted to make sure we could open when, you know, we could open and the power came back and stuff and that meant the plumbing had to be fixed.

So, you know, there's so many emergency calls. Plumbers were weeks out. It was like, no way. So just figured it out. 

**Athena:** But that's that's the lanes that you go to and we'll go to, you know, it's like. The risk of flooding [01:10:00] your whole shop and not being open for weeks because you couldn't find a plumber was YouTube your resource.

Like, how did you even figure this out? What did you do? 

**Nash:** You just kind of, I don't know, just give it a shot and figure it out. A lot of trips to the hardware store. I mean, I was discussing after, but I was so happy that I had figured it out after, even though it was like. That's shitty day. Um, you know, and also the team knows like, oh, man, he came and fix the pipes.

Yeah, so all these little things get you little wins, not only for yourself, but for the team as well, because that was pretty early on, like, a couple months into owning it. So, yeah, 

**Athena:** pretty scary. 

**Nash:** Yeah, you use whatever resources you can get to figure it out 

**Athena:** and you'll go to whatever it leads when it's your own.

It's like. 

**Nash:** Yeah, 

**Athena:** this isn't someone else's problem. It's, [01:11:00] it's your problem. And like, what are you going to do in that moment? Are you going to figure out how to be a plumber? Are you going to 

**Nash:** wait and wait 

**Athena:** for a plumber and not be able to get revenue for a couple of weeks? And, um, so a lot of people experience like the J curve.

First couple years of ownership, so have you experienced something like that? Like, how are you feeling about the, the 1st, couple of years and the returns that you were expecting versus what you're getting revenue, that sort of thing. 

**Nash:** Take care of, like, dipping and then going back up. 

**Athena:** Yeah, 

**Nash:** so. Revenue dipped.

What, like 10% or so com You know, if you look on an annualized basis, it was up, but if you take like the trailing 12 months bef after purchasing versus, you know, whatever, it was like really strong the last 12 months. I don't, I'm sure the owner knew and he was just cranking. [01:12:00] Um, so we were down 10%. Um, honestly, we were trending pretty good and then all the team stuff happened in the end of the year.

And it ended up going down a little bit. Uh, you know, I kind of expected that, but I was really happy looking back on it based on how it went, given all that we and I had been through and that's really where. You know, I was like, I wasn't bought into being, you know, involved and kind of, you know, taking control because I was told that, you know, kind of work towards passive management and I was like, fuck that and just, you know, decided to turn it on this year and we're, you know, doing a lot better.

Um, so, yeah, I guess I wouldn't call it like a jaker, but, you know, a slight dip in a muffin, but it was still [01:13:00] surpassed my financial goals and. Emotional walls and whatever else I had expected. It was, you know, it would, it had fulfilled me for the 1st year. So, 

**Athena:** yeah, I was like, what's better 2, right? 

**Nash:** Yeah, like, by numerous times over.

**Athena:** That's great. So, you know, the extra effort, like, pay off financially as well. Um, and you've taken vacation since it's not like you've been there. 

**Nash:** Yeah, probably 

**Athena:** like, 5 

**Nash:** or 6 weeks last year. Um, they are generally during the holiday weeks and stuff already. Like Christmas and whatnot, but, um, there is dips.

You know, those weeks I'm trying to assess out, like, is it cause I'm gone? Is it cause it's a holiday week? And like, people don't generally get the cars worked on anyway. So [01:14:00] sometimes I'm trying to figure out, plus like I do a lot when I'm here so that it's a burden on the team, not having a team member.

So anyway, it's worth it. 

**Athena:** I, uh, I mean, it's great. You know, it's like, it's. Giving you your lifestyle, you're able to be present with your family. Also, I don't know if we pointed this out, but Nash had a baby like in the middle of this acquisition too, right? Like, well, you didn't, your wife did, you became father to number two in the middle of your acquisition.

**Nash:** Well, it's, so I didn't plan it this way, but, um, I was working W 2, I got under contract in my W 2 April 30th. And we closed on August 30th. I had the kid mid June, so I was on paternity leave for three, four months. So that took me past close. And then I started in the business while on paternity leave, um, didn't plan it.

Just that's how it [01:15:00] worked. Um, and, uh, then decided it was going. Okay. And. Whatever, so I quit and didn't have to ever go back to my job and yeah, that's how it all lined up. 

**Athena:** You're able to have your paternity leave while 

**Nash:** you're doing the transition too. That's great timing. Right? It ended up being really good timing.

Yeah, I quit before my mandatory, like, come back. I was like, I feel really bad about this. So I told him, hey, I'm not coming back. Just firing me now. You know, I had, I didn't tell him I had bought a business. I just said, you know, family reasons. Um, I think they ended up paying me the whole paternity leave anyways, just because I'd been there for so long or I don't know who knows, but yeah.

**Athena:** Um, well, uh, such good insights and learnings and, um, folks, if anyone has questions for Nash, go ahead and throw your hands up and I'm going to keep asking questions until I see some hands go up. Um, so what would you, now you're like a year and a half [01:16:00] into it. What would you have done differently, if anything, or what would you have just told yourself to mentally prepare for what was ahead?

**Nash:** It's hard to prepare for the unknown, but, um, spending more time with the people, I think I did spend quite a bit of time, but that's the biggest, uh. You know, nuance that can come up is just people on where their headspace is at over time, too. It's a constant process. So I don't know, still trying to figure out how to stay in touch with them, but also get everything done.

**Athena:** Yeah, it's a, it's a running back and forth between things constantly. Steve, I see your hand up. Go ahead. What? How can I. 

**Steve:** Hey, so Nash, thanks for joining us today. Super story. Uh, so I've got three questions and a comment. Um, actually the comment is more of a, uh, just a quick story because you shared about some of the lawsuits and what do [01:17:00] they say in life?

Uh, lawsuits are the toll booth of being in business or something like that. Some paraphrasing it. Uh, but quick story on that. My dad owned a car wash years ago and at the end of that tunnel car wash, right? Guy put it in reverse, backed into the blower, broke the back windshield. My dad got sued because the guy said he said he could never have sex again.

So you never know what's going to happen from a lawsuits perspective. And, and, uh, to your point too, insurance company got ahold of it and they said, we can't get, can't wait to get this guy. Can't wait to get this guy on the stand. But my three questions quickly. So number one, corporate W two as well. I got to just ask you, you know, first question is how in the world did you find the time to go on 50 drive bys?

Um, I'll give you all three questions up front. And then second question is, but I 

**Athena:** know do first one first because he probably won't remember him. So first one, how did you do 50 ride along while you were working? [01:18:00] 

**Nash:** Well, as you know, they'll just fill up your calendar with stuff. So I just would block time and say, like, here's my dedicated time for sourcing.

And then if I had a meeting, I would just block it out. And, you know, we were working from home. So I had an advantage. Um, you know, they wouldn't really know if you disappear. You could kind of stay on both tasks at the same time. But that's kind of, yeah, we definitely dip out without him knowing. 

**Steve:** Cool.

Second thing is, uh, when you mentioned about the skilled workers, right? Yeah, it's highly skilled. It's one of the things that you think about going in, man. I've got a highly skilled. I'm guessing you don't have a bunch of guys standing around at Home Depot that are skilled and replacing transmission. So, you know, the labor pool has got to be a little difficult as well.

How many employees did you have when you bought the business? So, what was that real? I mean, you said you took the risk, took the impact and you've survived it pretty well. Um, you know, did any, any, uh, thoughts on. On maybe doing it differently earlier, even, [01:19:00] 

**Nash:** um, like changing up the team earlier, 

**Steve:** changing up the team earlier when you realize this is the bad fit.

**Nash:** Yeah, definitely waited longer than I probably should have with a few of them. I'm talking about 1 in particular 2 in particular that took about a year to. Move on, um, you know, and they were, but it gave us the time to train and look for others. So, you know, how many 

**Steve:** other skilled folks did you have in there?

So, like, 1 leaves, is it 10 

**Nash:** builders are the highest skill? I had 3 and 2 of them are now gone. And I've got essentially 2 different ones. 1. we trained when we hired. So 

**Steve:** that's inspiring to hear that you were able to do that and still keep going. So that's awesome. Yeah, there was a dip, but, you know, we figured 

**Nash:** it out.

Just took a little time. 

**Steve:** Fantastic. My last question is that cultural thing. So you come from a corporate culture where nobody talks about anything significant. [01:20:00] You walk into a culture. That's a little bit more blue collar where everybody knows within 25 cents an hour what everybody's making and they all talk about everything.

You know, how how did you. Would you have, or do you have any recommendations as we get into this coming from that corporate world on, uh, you know, understanding, I guess you said you vetted with the owner, the nuances with each employee, is there anything else you would do to better understand what the employee mindset is in the industry you're going into?

**Nash:** Well, what what's important to them, you know, so we did talk a little bit about, like, hey, this person's driven by money. This person's driven by, you know, praise this person likes, you know, not to be told what to do or like, hey, when you're ready, here's like, the next thing, you know, certain little tiny ways of communicating with each person or what is important to them.

Is good to know, and you kind of have to figure that out with your own relationship that you start developing as well. [01:21:00] Um, I'd say motivation by money is good. It can also be like, get out of hand, which 1 of the highest skilled person people was paid 65 an hour. Plus, like, all these other bonuses and stuff and, you know, was never happy and started doing, you know, less and less and less over time.

It's just like, you know, so, um, it can be a never ending kind of request for, you know, compensation or this or that. Um, you got to find the right balance of monetary and other rewards or. You know, feedback system that makes them make sense 

**Steve:** to your folks are monetarily driven or mostly more, uh, other soft like praise.

Like you said, 

**Nash:** well, 1 of the guys I hired I'd say there's always a mix of both. It's just like, where exactly does each person land? Um, 1 person we hired from Gresham Dodge and he. Had to [01:22:00] basically fight for his hours. So we have just base hourly rate. I pay you this amount. No matter what you just work for hours.

You fuck it up. I pay you the same rate. Right? Obviously, we're going to have a discussion of, like, hey, is there anything we could have, like, learned or done different to, like, not fuck it up. Um, but you would have to go fight for his hours every single time. He was just Through with it. And I was like, Hey, I'll pay you that rate.

But like, not giving any bullshit about it. He's, I think as far as I know, Happy's a clam. Just not having that stress or not having to worry about the monetary aspect of his job and just having a, a, uh, consistent wage. So, um, 

**Steve:** thank you. Appreciate 

**Nash:** others really like being part of the team and that's kind of most important to them, right?

Uh, wanna feel part of a community? I think. 1, 1 guy in particular, so 

**Steve:** I appreciate your insights and all the best [01:23:00] as you continue to build this. Thanks for joining us. 

**Nash:** Yeah, thank you. 

**Athena:** Great question, Steve Ryan, quick 1 because we want to let Nash go back to this. I took up most of the time. 

**Ryan:** Okay. Thanks Nash.

Really appreciate you sharing the story. I, um, I wanted to ask. You know, you mentioned right at the gate, you did 1. 9x was the multiple and I wanted to hear that sort of sounds really attractive. Is there any backstories of how you kind of got that multiple? 

**Nash:** It was honestly, I gave them exactly what they asked for that was publicly listed on Biz by Cell.

Why it was listed like that. I don't know. But like I said, I was part of a lot of different offers and private equity was probably trying multiple different ones, trying to scoop it up. And that's not what the owner wanted. He didn't want anything to do with that. Wanted somebody he could [01:24:00] trust to hand off this thing he built for 30 years.

So it was just, I mean, I had done a lot of work, like Athena said. Looking at 50 businesses and preparing for that one just to pop up randomly. Right? So I was ready to go. Um, but it was luck that I found it. So, but if it was the 1st 1, I would have found I would have been nervous taking way too slow on every single step.

So there will be opportunities in life. It's just whether you're ready to be, take advantage of those. 

**Ryan:** And then you mentioned giving the seller the golf balls and you're like, that got me the deal. Um, and that was interesting that you said that because it was competitive. Right to think like some golf balls got you a deal for 1.

9 X. I would think that there were the money would in a competitive deal would win, but you want it with some golf [01:25:00] balls. Can you talk a little bit about that? 

**Nash:** Yeah, I think it just, um, that might drop in some lingo, you know, for the industry being here, being like, intrigued and what they did and asking a lot of questions, trying to figure it out showed him that, hey, I, I care and he cares about the team.

Right? They're all his friends for 30 years. Um, he built the building, you know, he built the legacy. Everybody knows him around town. So he wanted somebody to be here. That was one, the golf balls was just like, I don't know. Apparently I did more research than others and knew he was a golfer and he, that's all he wanted to do in retirement.

So it just like, and I didn't know that, but I just got kind of lucky in that regard that like he wanted to be done. Cause he's a workaholic and he wanted to go golf for the rest of his life. So, um, you know, I knew he was pretty good because I found his [01:26:00] name. I Googled it. He showed up on, like, turn it golf tournaments and stuff, but, like, pretty good scores.

It was like, well, and then I got very lucky because I got him a box of golf balls that he used all the time. His favorite ones or whatever. So, well, those are the ones that were on sale.

Such a 

**Athena:** good point, you know, like, those little, little things go a long way, but the fact you even thought like, let me research this guy. Let me research the business. Let me research this industry a little bit. So that when I show up, I can build, you know, just build a relationship with him, show him that I care, show him that I care about him as a person.

And I've, I've done my research, you know, and I'm being thoughtful. Like, that's kind of person you want to take over your legacy. So. You know, I, I took a page out of Nash's book myself, like when I was trying to go after that car wash and the guy wanted to go start a little alien wash near his ranch, so I showed up with like an alien mug [01:27:00] and an alien light, you know, it was like for your other wash that you were going to buy.

When I buy your watch that you're going to go leave because it on your ranch, you know, so it's like the, the helping them like think through like, what am I going to do next after I take, after I sell this business? So, you know, it was, it was such a nice personal touch that you did, but there was a lot of thought and research that went into it before you even turned, you were playing to win, you know, win his heart and win the business.

**Nash:** Yeah, if you do, they'll pick you and it's not about the money. I do got to run. 

**Athena:** Yes. Thank you so much for your time, Nosh. This was really, uh, amazing of you to come and take time out of your business and, and share all these insights, lots of learnings to come through from it. So thank you. We really appreciate it.

Um, I appreciate it. I've been so, uh, I've just enjoyed being a part of your journey and being able to hear about all this. It's really inspiring for those of us. That want to learn through people like you. So thank [01:28:00] you. 

**Nash:** I appreciate you being there for me. Good luck, everybody. Thank you all. 

**Athena:** Have a great day.

Thanks. Thanks, everyone. See you next time.
