# AcquiMatch Buyers Club 06/17/2025

[00:00:00] 

**Athena:** Hello? Hello. Welcome.

Hi, girl. Oh, I can't hear you. Hello? 

**Justin:** I. Hear me? Um, oh, there you 

**Athena:** are. Yep. Gotcha. Cool. I think Justin might be here as well. Hey Justin. Um, hello From a little hot desk in San Antonio, I'm heading to, um, acquisition.com. Workshop leader tonight to work on, um. Just bettering how we operate and stuff. So I'm really excited about that.

And Anka is actually on a plane to meet me, uh, to be able to come to the workshop and work with our, our consultants. Um, so that's fun stuff on this side. I'm excited to hear what's going on with the two of you. And also, um, Justin, I know you [00:01:00] weren't here on Thursday. Did you get a chance to watch Elliot's, um, buyer's Club?

**Justin:** Not yet. It's, I want to, it's on my list for sure. 

**Athena:** It's definitely a must watch. But Gil, I was, I was curious your takeaways or thoughts after that discussion last week with Elliot. 

**Gil:** Um, it was a great discussion. I thought that he presented his ideas very nicely, very well. Um, there, there, there he opened my eyes.

Lot of things, uh, as well. Um. It was great. It was, it was great having him, but I think he didn't, uh, finish to say what he had, what he had to say. Uh, I think he needs to come back. 

**Athena:** Yeah. There's, there's more. There. Any, any takeaways or things that you wanna share? Um, curious what, what was, what, what you learned.

And maybe Justin can, we can get him a little fomo so he goes back and watches it. 

**Gil:** Off the top of my head, I, I can't really say right now. I also just woke up from a nap, so I'm a little, I'm a little groggy, [00:02:00] but, uh. Um, I, I, I just remember it being very, very, very, uh, very powerful. Um, I can't put my finger on something specific right now.

**Athena:** Yeah. Um, I thought the, uh, it was interesting his negotiation tactic about flagging a problem without saying what you're gonna do about it. It's a very different tactic than what I would do. But, you know, he was talking about his, so Justin Elliot was specifically digging into, like, after LOI, things come back that weren't as they appeared, how do you handle it?

And he had this like three to five step process to retrade. And his tactic was basically like to tell the broker like, I see a problem, and broker's like, what are you gonna do about it? And you're like, I don't know. And you kind of let 'em stew a little bit. Um, and he said that basically instigates them going back and having a conversation with their client to say, Hey, there might be some things here that you need to do, dah, dah, dah, [00:03:00] dah.

And then, you know, you go away and think about it and come back to the table. Um, and. So I thought that was interesting 'cause I'm normally alike. I like to arrive with solutions, right on that. So negotiation something I think is very fascinating and um. Elliot's been doing QV specifically for like over 10 years now.

So he has a ton of really good expertise there. But we don't talk about that a lot. I don't hear that a lot in Will's stuff. Like after LOI stuff comes up, what do you do about it? So, um, it's a really good like buyer's club to watch and then. I wanna get him back, uh, if he'll give us his time and do more of that.

It was super inter interactive too. So he was like grabbing everybody on the buyer's club and like having them talk through their deals or experiences and stuff was great. Very cool. 

**Justin:** Yeah, it's, uh, sounds like a good one. Definitely want to, uh, dig in. 

**Athena:** Yeah, you got FOMO yet? 

**Justin:** I mean, I, I wanted it when you first [00:04:00] mentioned it.

It's definitely on my list. It just, it's been chaotic the last couple business days and then, uh, the weekend was pretty much a no go for me. So, yeah. 

**Athena:** Happy Father's Day, all the fathers. Um, 

**Justin:** yeah. Thank you. 

**Athena:** So Steve, we were just, uh, chatting about Elliot's. Um, buyer's club last week. I know you, were there any takeaways or epiphanies that you got from his session?

Oh, you're muted there. 

**Steve:** I said, yeah, I'm afraid to sign an LOI, 'cause that's when it really gets crazy like. At 

**Luke:** this 

**Steve:** point? No, it was, it, it was great. I mean, he had a, a, a very, very realistic take. I also realized he lives in Atlanta, so I did follow him on LinkedIn. Uh, he's, you know, very, what, what I liked about it is, uh, he came from private equity.

And coming from private equity, he had a little bit different take than maybe some of us had just come from a corporate career into [00:05:00] this. Uh, and I think there's a, there's a little bit of a a you're not gonna BS me type thing. And he had, he had a pretty good, you know, delivery. And I think it's being prepared.

He is been through it so many times. He, he, pretty much anything he, anything Gil would throw at him he had an answer for. So if he can stump Gil, he is doing good.

**Athena:** He, um, I, I like, I like his, um, he's got a big heart, but also like, I feel like he likes supporting the little guy, you know, which is why I think he's niched off into, into first time buyers 'cause he felt. Like other against the PE bros and going to Harvard and that sort of thing. And um, you know, all of us individual buyers are others.

'cause normally it's like we're playing a game that the private equity and, you know, investors, strategic investors are playing and trying to catch up and figure it out while we're doing our day-to-day [00:06:00] lives and everything else. Not having backgrounds in any of this. So, um. Yeah, I was, I was just saying I thought the negotiation tactics that he talked about were really interesting and something like the, just negotiation in general is such an interesting topic to learn and dive into and experiment with and, and the whole I.

I see a problem. I'm not gonna give you an answer on what I'm doing about it yet. I'm like, oh my God, that, like, that makes my stomach turn a little bit. 'cause I like turning up and being like, okay, here's what we're gonna do about it. But actually letting him, you know, go off and have some discussions about what they, I thought he was 

**Steve:** really, I thought he was really good about his mindset.

Was his, was, was a mindset thing. And I, I thought what kind of hit home for me was when he, he talked about from a mindset standpoint, when the broker's like was no big deal. He's like, you're not the one making the million dollar bet or the $3 million bet. I'm the one, this is my money, this is my life, my, that livelihood that's on the line.

So, you know, kind of keeping [00:07:00] that perspective almost like, don't get bullied by the broker. That's what I, that's what I took away from it. 

**Athena:** Yeah, I, I think there was some really good tips in there for how not to let that happen. And it's, it's a good point, right? Like, no, nobody makes a single $3 million bet.

Nobody's ever walked into a casino and done that, at least none of in, of any of us, right? And. The point that brokers don't even do that. Brokers haven't even done what either side of the table do, and that maybe insecurity of being in the middle of something they themselves have never done was an interesting.

Dynamic to think about, but yeah, it's like even the owner didn't take a $3 million bet when he started the business. He, you know, grew it over time and maybe took out some loans or something, but $3 million bet or $5 million bet. It's, it's big. So, and I think brokers, um, you know, a lot of 'em get really good at intimidating and bullying and stuff, and now [00:08:00] they're able to do that even harder because it used to be that they got six to eight.

People inquiring on a deal and now they're getting hundreds within an hour of posting it. So it's making the monsters even worse. But, um, you know, they only have one deal to sell and you wanna buy a business, but. Not just any business. So the power really is, especially after LOI, the power really is in your hands because you've got it under offer.

And for them to go and start with somebody new, negotiate a whole new LOI start the due diligence process all over again. Means that they're pushing back their own payday another couple of months. And that's what they care about usually because they're, you know, not getting any money until they close.

Um, but also, you know, the point of 30 days before the close. Who does the broker work for 

**Steve:** you? Well, us The 

**Athena:** buyer. The buyer, yeah. That's where his paycheck's [00:09:00] coming from. The paycheck, the paycheck to the broker literally comes out of the loan that you yourself sign. That's how the broker gets paid. It's not the owner paying them because the owner can't pay them that money.

The only, uh, the money only goes to the broker when you sign the loan and the loan gets paid. 

**Steve:** That was another good point too, that the realization, 'cause sometimes we think they may have the power, et cetera. Um, you know, just the realization that yeah, we have a lot more power than you think, even though, 'cause they'll, they'll pit you like, oh, we got multiple offers.

We have multiple offers. Maybe they do, maybe they don't. And, and I get the feeling from Elliot a lot of times that's just a lot of BS and it's positioning, uh, and, you know, to, to try to. You know, give, give a little fear to, to move you along. So, uh, I, I liken it to, I don't do it, you know, competitively anymore, but I spent a lot of years doing the full contact karate, the OPED stuff, and every time you think, you know, I'm really nervous out there, the realization is that other guy is just as nervous as you are, [00:10:00] as scared as you are at doing this.

So, you know, that same mindset I kind of got from Elliot's, like, Hey. Yeah, they're gonna, they're gonna try to bully you, push you along a little bit, but you, you got, you have more power than you think. Especially once you're under LOI. That's, uh, 

**Athena:** yeah, I think that's the, um, the switch. Right. Do any of you play poker?

I do. 

**Justin:** I did extensively. 

**Athena:** Did, did you play tournament poker? 

**Justin:** Tournament and cash? 

**Athena:** Okay, so like, uh, and I'm sure Gil and Steve, you can probably imagine like when there's hundreds of people. The way you play is very different than when you're down to the final table, head to head. You have to actually switch strategies, like depending on how many players that you have and where you're at, because when you're playing early on, you just kind of need to be conservative.

Don't do anything crazy, you know, and like stay in it long enough to try to get to the final table. And then as players are eliminated, you get, you know, more aggressive. So [00:11:00] like. I actually, um, my relationship in college ended because I got better, way better than my boyfriend at poker. But I'm like, you give me stats and put a wager around it, like this is liter.

Like, okay, I'm obsessed. So I got, like, when I sat down at a table, I would intentionally let people think that I had no idea what I was doing. And when they weren't paying attention to me and they just thought I was this cute little girl trying to play poker, like, isn't she sweet? Whatever. And they wouldn't, wouldn't be too aggressive with me or they might try stuff and I just kind of, oh, is this what I do now?

Blah, blah, blah. And then I'd get heads up with somebody and I'd get very aggressive and they didn't know what I was doing because they didn't clock me. They didn't read me as like an issue in the first place. Right. So once you're under LOI, like that's your. Steel and you all the chips are basically on your side of the table then, and you can play a lot more aggressively and you can [00:12:00] call a lot more hands and call bluffs a lot more than you can when there's a whole bunch of players at the table and everybody kind of has the same amount of chips.

So I don't know if that analogy works, but this, I, I keep poker and business buying and like poker tournaments seems to. Be pretty similar. 'cause when there's a lot of players, when there's a lot of people going after a deal, you just wanna stay in it long enough and kind of 

**Luke:** get 

**Athena:** the chance to like play head to head and get that deal under offer.

But once it's under offer, like I said, you guys have all experienced negotiating Lois. There's a lot of work that goes into that. And then once you're actually under LOI. And start looking for like, you know, issues and stuff. Your month, two months passed when you started that, that discussion. So a broker, having to restart that with somebody else is kind of a, you know, the power dynamic has shifted.

So, um, I'll do better job reminding you all of that too. [00:13:00] 

**Steve:** I thought one more point Elliot made too, was that he sees a lot is in that, let's say 90 day window of due diligence or whatever, people wait until like day, 60 day, sorry, look this off. They wait until day 60, until they start looking at quality of earnings.

Like, what were you doing for 60 days? 

**Athena:** Well, I think that specifically was like he was saying like his PE. Friends that like thought they could do most of the due diligence themselves before engaging someone like him. Um, I just like to see all get term sheets, which usually you can do in under 30 days if you like aggressively do it.

I think Gil got his together in like a couple weeks when he was, and he got multiple. So as long as you're kind of aggressively going after those term sheets, like you just wanna make sure it's financeable before you throw down 10, 15 K on a QV. Um. Yeah. Are you gonna say something, Gil? [00:14:00] 

**Gil:** Question. So between the, uh, QOV providers that we've, uh, been exposed to, which is Chris and, and, and now, uh, um, Elliot.

Elliot. Elliot, sorry. Thank you. Um, are they the same? Do, do they do, do you know if they're the same price? Do you know which one is preferable in, in different circumstances? 

**Athena:** Yeah. So, um, Elliot is gonna be a little bit more expensive than Chris, if I remember correctly. Um. But with Elliot, you're getting some, like on a deal that you anticipate maybe that, like on, on yours, Gil, if you kept going and like you had, you had Bully broker, like having someone like Elliot in addition to us would be a really great asset, right?

To be able to like, help you with those crunchy conversations that come up with a broker. So Elliot also does like, um, you know, a, a like advisory coaching kind of stuff too. So I think when he does. Work with clients on diligence. He spends a lot of [00:15:00] time like helping them get their deal over the line also.

Um, Chris is excellent. Um. And does really great thorough reports. He picks up on a lot of things. Um, but he might not necessarily help you with like negotiation, right? Like he'll, he'll help you kind of understand the financials and also, um, he will do so, like what he also does is offer to do your financial support afterwards so you can get 'em as like a fractional CFO afterwards.

So I think it's, you know, they're both. Awesome. It's like who do I resonate with? Which is why I always like to give people a couple options. Like if you wanna speak to a couple lenders or lawyers or QV providers, like you might just jive with someone better, but they're both gonna be excellent choices.

Cool. Thank you. And I think the price difference might be slightly, I think Elliot might come in a little bit more premium. But again, you get that built in champion behind you, kind of [00:16:00] like helping you figure out some of those, those issues or stand up to the, um, 'cause you will oftentimes be getting your QV provider on the phone with the brokers and the sellers, um, to be able to go through that sort of stuff.

So. Chris is very thorough and does an amazing job. Um, but I don't know if he'll necessarily give you the Elliot flavor when you have a bully broker. He'll just kind of, you know, do the work. Um, he might, he, I mean, he, he's very like, he's very even keel and like, he'll call out when he sees BS too. He is like, no, like I've been through things and he is like, we reject this, we reject this, we reject this like.

If there's no basis for it, he'll give you reasons why they've rejected it and you know, they're all of their thought processes behind it. 

**Luke:** Mm-hmm. Cool. 

**Athena:** Yeah. So Cool. Well, um, Justin, I'm. To hear if there's any update from your side. 'cause I know you were running [00:17:00] after hometown. 

**Justin:** Yeah. Um, not uh, too much yet.

I'm working through getting the LL uh, LOI updated LOI in order and still I'm, I'm still tweaking some of the, the modeling just 'cause I, I really, I, it's funny where you were saying about Elliot. I think I want to, I know I'm not under LOI yet, so it's not like I've got too much to play with here, but I. I think I went intentionally undercut even what I thought I was gonna do originally, and then give room if they want to negotiate.

Um, and I, I think that's the play I I wanna make on this. You know, the, the, I was offering originally a 4.5 multiple, which was already high, and that was all the. Calendar 2024 numbers, which were higher than the trailing 12. So all of that compounded. Now they're, they're probably gonna hate me 'cause they're gonna be like, what the heck kinda offer is this?

Because I'm gonna come down in two ways. I'm, I'm using the, the, the trailing 12, which the broker should understand. Uh, but then I'm also gonna decrease multiple, [00:18:00] um, I'm, I'm not gonna offer four or five, which would be very premium I think. So I'm kind of looking, I think more around the four, uh, marker. I think that I'm a little more comfortable with that.

Uh, and I'm also looking at two different options, which you and I talked about. One being kind of four. Straight up with, you know, less of a, of a performance or actually, I don't think I have anything in performance, just some seller note, you know, component there, no performance. Or I'll do a 4.5 multiple, but a pretty heavy performance to hit that number.

Um, and then in the modeling, actually that route, the, the debt service coverage is better. It looks actually more favorable if I could go with the, the higher multiple. So effectively paying more, but. Much greater performance attached to it and maybe, and so I think I'm actually okay with that, if that's the route we go.

Or he, he elects and I think he might, because he sees that's with a higher price tag, right? And so I think he [00:19:00] might be okay with that. I think even the broker might champion that. So that's kind of my, my frames of thought right now. The only thing is, I don't know, I don't know what I would position yet or how I would position, like I know in real estate, I've done a lot of like.

Offers kind of concurrent, like, it's like, hey, have your flavor. Like here's flavor A, here's flavor B, I don't care which one you want. Like have a pick. I don't know if that's as common in, in the SMB world, but, uh, it's pretty common in real estate. Um, so I don't know if that's even something that I should be toying with.

You know, when it comes to LOI offer, 

**Athena:** I, um, I, I did it on mine. You know, I think it's reason. It's like, here's. Here's the cash you can walk with and you know, gimme a transition and that's kind of it. Or here's the cash you can get if you do a transition with me over one to two years, but I'm still gonna be running it and you just need to advise [00:20:00] me.

So I'm betting on you, but you're betting on me too. 

**Luke:** Yeah. 

**Athena:** And if you think you can, you know, bestow this on me, um. Steve, Steve made a good point. LOI or IOI format. I was actually thinking that Steve, I wonder, I would actually reach out to Claudia if I were you and just say like, Hey, I'm kind of working to offers here.

Um, I. I'm thinking I should send them just top line over to you. Uh, you know, one has a performance note we talked about, one does not. Um, so I can send both offers and then, and then we can go from there. Um, 'cause it sounds like they are, what? We don't know what the unknown is. And this is the thing that can catch you out, is if they're having conversations with other people.

Mm-hmm. And if they are and somebody gets in an LOI. Then they could beat you to the [00:21:00] punch by signing an LOI. But it sounds like they really like you and wanna work with you. So if you send two offers, like this is bringing it down, reducing my risk based on what, you know, the trailing 12 and you saying that there's variability like you to year, um, which is reasonable, or here is like, you know, an offer if you help me.

Be the owner you think I can be over the next one to two years, like I'm gonna be at the helm, but I need you there advising me through it. Yeah. Um, so yeah, maybe in the IOI where you just take that, um, that, uh, section, which is like, this is the offer, this purchase price under these terms, right? This much as a normal seller.

Note this much as your equity injection, this much as, um, performance based note. Or option B. So I, I, I, um, I did that before too, and then I got [00:22:00] feedback from the broker before I dropped it into an LOI 

**Justin:** gotcha. Yeah, that's good. I would, it, it's, I was gonna kind of go that route too. I, I mean, I didn't know whether to keep it more IOI and then have a chat with the broker, um, before formalizing an LOI or just put them both into.

Two respective Lois, but either way, I was going to see if I could get the broker on the line, just one-on-one first. Um, and that's just for my sales background. It's like when I send pricing for contracts for my software, I never just send it via email in a vacuum. It's always like, Hey, I've got it, but let's hop on a call to talk through it.

And so I was gonna do that with the broker. With Claudio just to get his input one-on-one so he can speak candidly without, you know, concern of for the seller and, and you know, that kind of thing. Um, 

**Athena:** that's a good idea. I'd schedule that sooner than later, though, in case they are talking to other people.

So you don't drag it out. Yeah, yeah. Or I'll play Lose it out from under your feet. And then, um, [00:23:00] you know, like. What, what Elliot was saying. And, and I think his good language just be like, if I'm going to be making an $8 million bet, right, like these, I, I need to be sure. And like this year's already down from last year pretty significantly.

So yeah. It sounds like Claudia's pretty reasonable. 

**Justin:** Yeah. Yeah. I mean, he is the one who, who chimed in with the performance, you know, kind of agreeable or you know, kind of. Not speaking for the seller, but kind of saying, yeah, yeah, like let's send, we understand. He also understood that, you know, the financing side, they would be looking at that trailing to pretty, with a scrutinizing eye and would be leaning on that heavily as opposed to just, you know, 20, 24 numbers.

Um, and Claudio. I planted that seed for the, mostly for the seller because Claudio knows, but the seller does, you know, he's never done this before, so he's just kind of relying Claudio and I, he Claudio was like, yeah, yeah, I know you're right. So, [00:24:00] um, yeah, he's, uh, I think that's gonna be pretty constructive, so.

All right, cool. I'll see if I can, uh, if I can set that up and have that chat with Claudio. Yeah, 

**Athena:** yeah. With seasonality, like that makes the bank nervous, you know? Um, and also of what you know, of what they didn't like of the other offers. It's like, Hey. This offer, like takes him out of CEO role. He's just advising and mentoring me.

And you know, in one to two years he won't need to do that anymore, but like, he doesn't have to work full-time in the business for five years to get that extra $2 million payout. Right. And yeah. Um, that's not, that's like over five years, which is that 400 grand a year. Like he's pulling down more than that.

So it's not a huge, Hmm. Amount, really when you look at the time scale of like what, what he would have to invest of his time in order to get that additional payout. So I would do that. I would pull it down, maybe make [00:25:00] the, the performance note more attractive than the cash at close. I would pull the cash at close down even more.

**Justin:** Yeah. Maybe the uh, which 

**Athena:** the performance note or the cash close. Yeah. 

**Justin:** Yeah, I like that. 

**Athena:** So maybe like 3, 5, 3, 7, 5, and just be like in light of the trailing 12, like I know he did an amazing year last year, but like what I'm seeing so far is that's not sustainable. And I, I can't take that kind of bet if I don't have him locked in to help me get the performance back to back to where it could be.

But it's different than an earnout, you know, it's like it's not achieving anything they haven't done in the past. It's just helping me keep the ship steady. 

**Justin:** Yeah. Yep. All right, cool. I like that. Maybe we can, uh, I can, I don't know, drop some, some things up and we can review that in our, uh, in our sync, uh, tomorrow.

**Athena:** Oh, please do. Yeah, that'd be great use for that. [00:26:00] Cool. Nice. Awesome. Cool. I'm excited. Um, Gil, did you have a broker call today? 

**Gil:** I did. I did a call today. Um. We already scheduled a seller call for Monday. Oh, great. So moving forward, the only thing is that, uh, according to this broker, he has multiple, he has many people interested in this and, uh, somebody's already going on, uh, a site, uh, visit with them on Friday.

So all these different kind of things. Okay, I'll, I'll, I'll play this game. I'm meeting, I'm meeting the stars on, on Monday, and we'll take it from there. No, no one has the exclusivity yet. 

**Athena:** Great. And how did the broker call go? I know you had some, some thoughts that maybe only the owners were gonna be answer.

Was the broker helpful or, 

**Gil:** um, not really. He didn't know the answers. So I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm gonna sit down with the, uh, with the sellers and, and ask these questions. Uh, [00:27:00] um, they're, they're specifically around New Jersey laws, uh, and I'm not really sure how they get around. Building walls without having a general contractor license, you know?

Um, so yeah, it'll be interesting to talk to 'em about that. Uh, and I, at the end of the call, I'm gonna ask them for the 12, 20 months, because it's June and I only have 24 numbers. Uh, and then there is, uh, the, the profession that I did see the past three years, there's a very sharp decline year after year after year.

Um, broker has an excuse for it, but I want to hear it from the seller's mouth. So, 

**Athena:** yeah. What's the broker saying? The excuse is 

**Gil:** they are tired. They don't want, they, they're put, they're turning away work. They don't wanna work anymore. Um, and they made a shift a few year, uh, back after 22 to, uh, not do any landscaping work, just basin area work, uh, missionary work and uh, things like that.

And even in the missionary work, they're doing very specific [00:28:00] jobs that have higher mar, they have higher margins. But, uh, their revenue just dropped tremendously. Um, so, um, wanna hear that from the horse's mouth? 

**Athena:** Hmm. Interesting. Yeah. Um, landscaping is one of those interesting ones because you can do a nice little, it's, it's one of the easier ones to do a roll up with without like, um, castrating like the original business, you know, like.

You're basically buying customers and kind of like foothold and crews and stuff. So it's a, it's a interesting industry. Obviously I'm adjacent to it with my boyfriend being in it, but it's really interesting to hear how easy it is to do a good job. Like, and, and nobody does it. You know, it's kind of like the, just the standard for landscaping is very low.

When you say they're building walls, is it retaining walls or actual structural walls? 

**Gil:** I don't know, but I can see [00:29:00] pictures on the website where they're building stone walls and I don't know if they're structural. I don't know. I don't know anything. So I'm gonna ask them those questions. Um, and uh, honestly, when, when, when I was, uh, listening to the broker call, um, that, that looked, did, uh, I had to look up some stuff, uh, because I was like, this world is so.

Foreign to me. Um, last time I cut grass, I was probably eight years old and my father was, was, was making me do it. Um, so yeah. We'll, we'll see what this is all about. 

**Athena:** Yeah, that's one of the cool things about landscaping though, is like all of us probably mowed a lawn at some point in our lives. You know, we've got experience.

My mom used to like, that was, my mom had all these chores that I could earn money doing. She's a single mom, you know, for, for some of my childhood. So it was like, okay, well you can earn this amount of money for doing this. And the lawn was always the thing I could, like $25 I could earn mowing the lawn, which was actually a pretty good [00:30:00] fee back then.

But yeah. Um, okay, cool. 

**Gil:** Yeah, they don't do any lawn work. They don't do any lawn work anymore. Um, they don't do any design. They don't do, they do very little decks mo Most of they do right now is masonry work. Mm. And you would be to bring back the other work that, uh, that they've pushed away, 

**Athena:** right. Is, I wonder if that's due to the declines.

Did they just cut off one of their revenue sources? 

**Gil:** According to the broker, that's what he did. 

**Athena:** Right. Okay. Interesting. Um, that'll be a good conversation. So are you meeting them in person or is it 

**Gil:** call Monday and he even in the call, it's not a Zoom call, it is a phone call. He said he'll conference us all in on the phone.

So yeah, we'll see how that goes. 

**Athena:** I would do some, uh, GPT research and like see if you can learn enough lingo to be dangerous. [00:31:00] Um, you know, so like some of these like retention walls or masonry terms or that sort of thing. Um. I know Nash won over his transition transmission repair guy just by doing some of that before he went in.

Mm-hmm. Um, and also researching the company and see if he can find out anything about them or the neighborhood or the reviews that they get or anything like that. That can sometimes be the edge of building the rapport for them to hold off from signing an LOIA little bit longer. 

**Gil:** They have amazing, uh, they have really good Google reviews.

Um, great. Like 4.9 after 70 some reviews. Wow. Um, so that, that's very promising. Um, and, uh, I, it's not too hard to wrap my head around this business. You know, it's, it, it makes sense. Uh, the, the, the work itself makes sense. It's, it's very simple. Uh, however, it's not work that I can do. Um, I'm gonna, I'm gonna have to hire a foreman.

Because the husband won't stay on for more than a year. [00:32:00] Uh, and he is the current foreman and general manager for everything. Uh, he's not the owner though. The wife is the owner, so he's gonna stay on for a year, uh, being paid a salary of course, which I'm gonna take into consideration, my modeling. And once I let him go, bring in somebody else and then grow the business.

So it is, it is gonna be kind of, uh, about the same. So. 

**Athena:** Well, his salary should already be in the expenses then, right? Because it's the wife whose salary's getting added back. 

**Gil:** I honestly don't know. I honestly don't know. I, I need to look when there's 

**Athena:** two, if there's two owners leaving, then. Traditionally, and, and this is like what every broker should be doing, is that only one owner's salary gets back because the way we calculate s st is based on one owner and one person replacing.

Mm-hmm. So if it's two owners, then um. And they, they're, they've both been taking distributions and stuff, then they should be doing a negative add back. So we can look at the [00:33:00] numbers tomorrow if you want, on our call and dig into that a little bit more. And I can show you. But I think it's just beneficial to remind everybody, right, like if a broker or a sim doesn't have, uh, an adjustment or make it clear that it's only like one owner that whose salary is being added back.

Um, then they're not calculating it properly. And so we can make SDE adjustments, um, to replace that owner because you can't, you're, you're one person. You can't replace two people. So then valuing a business on the basis of one, replacing two is not, um, a good way to do it. Does that make sense? 

**Gil:** Yeah, it does.

It does. I'm looking at it right now. We do have office compensation as an add back. Um, great. But it's, again, it's, it's, it's peanuts. It's, uh, less than half of the minimum wage. So, we'll, we'll, we'll talk about it tomorrow. 

**Athena:** Okay, cool. We'll look at it and then I can pull out the specifics and we can see what they did there.

'cause it might, if he's being the foreman, then he might be [00:34:00] being paid in the p and l as a foreman and they wouldn't add that salary back in. Okay. And if, if they haven't, then we can look at, um, you know. Valuing it based on what it would need to be. So, but typically if there's two owners leaving and it's a broker deal, they're only calculating one owner's salary in the SDE or the adjusted ebitda.

**Steve:** Okay. 

**Athena:** Unless the owner that is the second owner is like. I put my wife on payroll, but she does nothing in the business, right? Like it's literally just a tax efficient way of getting money out of the business and they literally have no duties. So that is one situation where it's allowable or paying kids a salary because they were models for Instagram.

You know, like, which is another thing you can do for taxes. If you take pictures of your kids and you put 'em in your marketing brochures, guess what? They can legitimately get a salary in your business for being a model. Yeah. 

**Gil:** Um, yeah, [00:35:00] so we'll see. 

**Athena:** Cool. Okay. Well looking forward to that. Um, awesome. So anything else that would be helpful to chat through today or should I give you guys 20 minutes back?

**Gil:** I'm good. Yeah, I'm good. 

**Athena:** Amazing. Cool. Well, I'm looking forward to diving in a little deeper on these two with you guys tomorrow. Have a good rest of your day. I'll see you then. 

**Justin:** Bye.
