0:00 - Anke Jordaan
  Yeah, it's just sometimes, it's just like, and I don't even know if I'm the only person that hears it, it's just like I hear the very faint, very bad quality piano music in the background the whole time.

0:11 - Luke Gillespie
  It's like elevated music. Did you play music?

0:15 - Ryan Cash
  Did you play piano, Anke? I do, yeah.

0:18 - Anke Jordaan
  I play keyboard and I play guitar and I sing a little as well, so.

0:23 - Ryan Cash
  I was to say, it's something that only like a musician would pick up, that level of detail.

0:30 - Anke Jordaan
  It's an interesting observation. I, you may be right. It could be. I haven't touched a guitar though in like three years.  I have to, I have to admit that. Athena.

0:41 - Athena Simpson
  Hey. Hey, y'all.

0:44 - Charis Siau
  Hi, hi. How's it going?

0:46 - Ryan Cash
  We about Anke's SoundCloud rap career. She's a rapper. No, she's just a musician. Oh, were saying that looks muted.

0:59 - Anke Jordaan
  What? The days now because sometimes he has this background piano noise that I keep flagging for him and I don't know if it's just me that hears it and Cash said normally when somebody hears that it's because they're a musician and he was asking me, do I play an instrument?  So yeah, I am a musician. I was a musician, but so that's maybe why the bad piano music in the background of Luke sometimes it's just I can't focus at all.

1:29 - Athena Simpson
  Okay, so like now I'm picturing Anka rapping. It's out there.

1:36 - Ryan Cash
  I'm going to do a deep dive. I'm to find the rap career, Anka.

1:38 - Anke Jordaan
  I know you've got some deep cuts.

1:40 - Ryan Cash
  I feel like there's some AI tech that can turn Anka into a rapper.

1:46 - Charis Siau
  I want to.

1:48 - Ryan Cash
  We can replace that video of yourself, Athena, like the Zoom. Like welcome to Aquamatch video with an Anka rap video.  Oh my god, please.

2:05 - Charis Siau
  Don't rap.

2:06 - Anke Jordaan
  I don't rap. I sing.

2:11 - Athena Simpson
  Oh my god, this is a story all about how some EBITDA got turned upside down.

2:20 - Anke Jordaan
  Oh my goodness, Athena, that's really good.

2:24 - Athena Simpson
  I'm just stealing the Fresh Prince.

2:26 - Anke Jordaan
  I know. I can't take any credit for that. I know that series or that sitcom. I'm not sure which one it is.  I'm not that young. don't think Luke will know it, though. The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air?

2:41 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah, I know it, Will Smith. Can you recite the song, though?

2:46 - Athena Simpson
  Oh no. Yeah, okay. So I'm probably the only one on the team old enough to be able to recite it.  My boyfriend and I were... Laying on the couch talking about all these, like, shows that Jaden, who's 17, like, just, you know, probably Luke and maybe all of you just never, never will see, like, Roseanne and Home Improvement and Fresh Prince.

3:15 - Ryan Cash
  Dangerous rabbit hole to go down, Athena. You gotta beware of that one. I've seen Roseanne.

3:23 - Luke Gillespie
  That's a good show.

3:25 - Athena Simpson
  Cheers, though.

3:26 - Ryan Cash
  I was a big Cheers fan. They used to do Cheers on Nick at Night when I was a kid.  So I used to watch Cheers a lot.

3:32 - Luke Gillespie
  What was the one?

3:33 - Ryan Cash
  was, like, eight watching a sitcom about these people at a bar, which is crazy. Who lived at a bar, yeah.

3:40 - Athena Simpson
  Nothing wrong with that.

3:42 - Luke Gillespie
  Go to a bar every day.

3:44 - Athena Simpson
  Life's good over here. Well, what was it? Was Al Bundy, that one? What was it? Married with Children? Yeah.  You're getting really crazy.

3:56 - Ryan Cash
  Soon you're going to start talking about Party at Five.

4:00 - Athena Simpson
  I didn't really get into that one. Saved by the Bell was one that I watched quite a bit of.  Yeah.

4:09 - Anke Jordaan
  I guess on the Friends generation, like Friends, How I Met Your Mother, on that generation.

4:14 - Athena Simpson
  Yeah, that was a little bit after me, I think. No, Friends was around. I was in Friends, but Friends was on for like 10 years.

4:23 - Anke Jordaan
  Yeah, Friends was on for 10 years. Friends and then How I Met Your Mother kind of like on there as well.

4:29 - Athena Simpson
  Amazing. Well, so good stuff today. So it looks like deal flow is flowing. So this call was meant to like go through deal reviews and cash hit the jackpot in terms of like red herrings on deals.
  SCREEN SHARING: Anke started screen sharing - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/383860717?timestamp=279.358641  There's not necessarily anything wrong in your analysis. I'm just like there's so many things here that I want to, rather than my feedback going in silo, like pulling it out for the team to kind of learn through that.  Um, so there was some. Some other things that I wanted to chat through today as well. And let's get through your guys' stuff first so that I can just use whatever time that we have left.

5:13 - Charis Siau
  On mine, Athena, it's basically the same thing that I think we're going to be covering in yours as well with Jim on the scorecard.  Uh-huh. So we can tackle that now or we can wait to go through that. All up to you.

5:30 - Athena Simpson
  Cool. What specifically on the scorecard was your question?
  ACTION ITEM: Add definitions to scorecard. Clarify metrics, thresholds, evaluation criteria.
 - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/383860717?timestamp=346.9999

5:36 - Charis Siau
  So in your feedback about the SOPs and the relocatable location. So I can pull up my screen if that's easier.

5:53 - Anke Jordaan
  Oh, no. No, no, no.

5:55 - Athena Simpson
  It's stuff that I didn't want to talk about. And Anke, I'm thinking we need to add definitions into this.  The scorecard so that we're all scoring from the same place so that I didn't want to talk through that, Charis.  think that was where the feedback came from you was just like how we're scoring this when we're looking at it.  Yeah. And I wanted to talk through the scorecard overall, give some clarity, passion, ask for some training on that.  So, yeah, we'll spend some time on that today. And then any specific questions that you guys have that I don't cover?  Like we can dig into that too. Cause again, it's the scorecard is kind of new, but, um, helps us all kind of like work off the same framework for the write-ups in terms of what we're looking at, um, for risk or value add or that sort of thing.  So cool.

6:42 - Charis Siau
  Awesome.

6:43 - Ryan Cash
  And I think you'll probably get to mine in the real estate route that's relevant. Yeah. That was my, um, yeah.

6:55 - Athena Simpson
  Real estate's a fun one. Um, and also just further. Complicates things because now you're having to learn how to potentially analyze real estate and businesses.  I've heard your talk track on the deal box discovery on real estate.

7:11 - Ryan Cash
  My eyes kind of rolled in the back of my head trying to keep up with all that. So definitely some education factor for me on that, for sure.

7:20 - Athena Simpson
  For sure. Charis, what's your comfort level with real estate and deals?

7:27 - Charis Siau
  I mean, I've worked with a lot of sellers with real estate attached to their deals. Most of the time we have them appraised.  So it's pretty clear and written out. So, I mean, that's kind of, I'm not an expert by any mean, but I'm familiar with the deal.  And, you know, usually we just add that on as a purchase price, right, separately from the purchase price of the business.
  ACTION ITEM: Watch Buyer's Club video on commercial real estate 101 w/ Andrew. Basic CRE overview.
 - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/383860717?timestamp=479.9999  Sometimes it's negotiated a little bit to make it like. Like a sweeter deal altogether, or if they want to keep the building and like lease it out right to the new owner.
  ACTION ITEM: Watch Buyer's Club video on commercial real estate 101 w/ Andrew. Basic CRE overview.
 - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/383860717?timestamp=479.9999  Cool.

8:10 - Athena Simpson
  So what I would love for you and Cash to do as a starting point is watch the buyer's club where we had Andrew come on.  And he broke down kind of basic commercial real estate 101. And I think that'd be a good starting point.  Luke, you were on that one, or do you feel like you could use a refresher on real estate?

8:35 - Luke Gillespie
  How comfortable are you feeling with real estate? I'm comfortable. Okay, good.

8:41 - Athena Simpson
  So if Charis and Cash, you watch that, then on our next deal review, Anka, let's add real estate from an Acquimatch standpoint.  Like, cause there's real estate one-on-one just in terms of how commercial real estate is valued. And then... And then there's all the nuances of how it can fit into a deal.  And I want to, I'm wondering if I even do like a whole separate training on this. I do have some potential time opened up tomorrow afternoon.  But watch that Buyer's Club as a starting point because that's a good kind of overview of, I think Andrew did a really good job of just commercial real estate 101.  And then we will do a, how does it fit into a deal session? What you guys need to look at with, and actually I'll just pull up Cash's deal in a second so you can see like, it's a little bit backwards Cash because we're going to talk about this deal specifically how to put it in.  You guys can do the commercial real estate 101 and then we can do like, okay, here's all the nuances of what to think about if real estate is included in a deal.  Yeah, I think it'll make more sense if I just pull up the deal and kind of talk through it with an active deal.  So let's first go through the scorecard so that we're all working off the same kind of understanding of the scorecard.  I realized I didn't really put any definitions apart from just the very light things. So what I thought we could do is pull up the scorecard, talk through every single section in terms of like how I'm viewing it.  And then, you know, if you guys think there's wiggle room or nuance or things in there, then let's do that.  What I want us to do is make sure that we're all working off the same set of premises for that scorecard.  If we're using that to value and or calling out things, it's like, hey, I think this should be maybe a.  Permanent edition of the scorecard or this keeps coming up in the scorecard and I think it's wrong so that you guys can bring it to deal review as well.  But additionally, the scorecard is a almost checklist for us as we're going through the write-ups of like, did I ask all these questions of the broker and is all of this reflected in the write-up?  So even if we didn't get the answer, at least asking the broker. So I'll just pull it up now and talk through it.  How does that sound as a starting point on the scorecard? Is that useful? Just getting some kind of further clarification.  Then I've asked Anke, grab everything and then we can do definitions in the scorecard so that you guys don't have to remember all this.  And we're also talking about what's the best way to kind of extract the information that we're dropping in these sessions and updating playbooks and checklists and stuff like that.  So that when you guys are in that moment, you have the reference there to refer. Thank Thank Thank Where is this?
  SCREEN SHARING: Athena started screen sharing - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/383860717?timestamp=736.054946  Oh, cool. I have the template all ready. Okay. So when you're using this, think about the thing I like to think about is like, did I get all these questions asked or answered either in the SIM or in the broker call?  So I would almost, if I were you guys, start filling this out pre-broker call so that you can have a list of your questions of like, what's not clear in the SIM that I should get clarity on or answered during this call.  Um, so... So the annual growth rate of revenue, it's like, is it more than 10? Are they growing at a rate of more than 10% per year is basically what I'm looking for here.  So that's a pretty simple one. Did they grow more than 10% in the previous year? If so, then sometimes this can be a red flag situation, right?  Like if they had a massive spike in the previous year, sometimes what brokers can tell sellers to do or what sellers do to try to prepare for growth is they'll find a way to like inflate revenue or they'll be selling on a just up year, but it's not necessarily consistent.  So if you're seeing like massive growth in the previous years, like is it a constant growth trajectory? And if so, what's causing the growth?  So even though this might be like a value adder. We want to understand what's driving the growth and is it sustainable?  So that's a question I would be asking if I'm seeing like rapid growth, I'd be jumping on the broker call like, hey, I'm seeing rapid growth.  Do you know what that's due to? Is that something that, you know, a new owner would likely to be seeing in the future?  Does that make sense on this one? You guys good or want to dig in? My only question on that is, are you wanting us to do on like all the years provided, like multi-year, or are you just wanting us to do that on the previous year?  I would, I would be looking at like, you know, usually we're getting at least last three years. So I would be looking at like, what's the trend I'm seeing over the last three years?  This one in particular is like the most recent year.

14:50 - Charis Siau
  Okay.

14:51 - Athena Simpson
  But if they're having, you know, growth year over year over year, then it's like, cool, why is that happening?  And art is. it like a growth trajectory that will continue or is it going to start flattening out? Like, did the seller get it to the max that it could get to?  And, you know, new owner is going to be just doing, you know, the same every year. So I'd want to understand the growth trend.

15:16 - Charis Siau
  Does that answer your question?

15:18 - Athena Simpson
  So if there's changes over the last three years, and this is something I was pointing out in one of Cash's write-ups, often what happened after COVID is there'd be a huge spike after COVID for a lot of businesses.  And then what looks like a drop in 23, but actually it was a normalization. So if we can see the years previous to that, then we, you know, you can usually tell like if, you know, 2020, 2021 was at a certain level that's similar to 23, then that increase in 22.  So, Might have just been a catch up after COVID and 23 was a normalization versus a drop. So then you want to call that out to client and you can ask the broker that like, hey, I saw a spike in 22 and then a drop in 2023.  Do you know why that is? Oh, you know, they had a bunch of backlog after COVID. They caught up in 2022.  So 23 is actually representative of a more normal year for them.

16:24 - Charis Siau
  Yeah. Okay. So noted on the trend and pointing that out for the sake of scorecard, do you want us to do just the previous year or are you okay with like a multi-year percentage there?  Is there anyone that you want us to standardize for that answer? I mean, I mean, I kind of wrote this as a, like the most recent year.  Okay.

16:54 - Athena Simpson
  Um, but if you're seeing growth year over year over year, then that might be even more. More of a value add, in which case, like, you know, I would call that out and kind of sense check your thought process here.  The way it's written currently is just the most recent year.

17:13 - Charis Siau
  Okay, got it. But that's a good thing to point out, right?

17:17 - Athena Simpson
  And like, how would we account for that if we're seeing like multi-year growth year over year? And it looks like that will be the foreseeable future.  Like there's no stopping the growth. If there's growth year over year over year over year, and then the seller's selling, I'm like, have we reached the ceiling of growth is my question.  You know, it's like, could the new owner continue that kind of growth rate? Or is the owner grown it as much as possible?  So regardless of what's happening with the growth, even though it's a value add, I'm kind of like, what's the story here?  And what does it look like for a new owner? Is that sustainable into the future?

17:55 - Charis Siau
  Yeah. Okay. Great. Great.

18:00 - Athena Simpson
  Sound good on this one? Clear there? Yeah, cool. We'll get some definitions. Cash, did you have some questions on that one?

18:12 - Ryan Cash
  Sorry, I just saw you on Oh, are we just talking about this one line item, the revenue growth? Yeah, I'm to go through it line by line.

18:18 - Athena Simpson
  Okay, yeah, no, I'm good.

18:19 - Ryan Cash
  Cool.

18:21 - Athena Simpson
  So SDE margin, more than 20%. This was something that I was going to make sure that we're all using the right language about the right metric.  So I'm seeing we're kind of interchanging EBITDA and SDE. So I wanted to clarify the difference between EBITDA and SDE and make sure that we're using the right language when we're describing it.  How comfortable are you guys on the differences between EBITDA and SDE, or would you like me to do another definition of that?

19:01 - Charis Siau
  I'm pretty comfortable. Okay, cool.

19:04 - Athena Simpson
  So then both Charis and Cash, I've seen you use EBITDA when you mean SDE. So just make sure, please, that if you're saying SDE, it's regarding the SDE or if you're talking about a profit metric, don't say EBITDA if you mean SDE because they're two very different numbers.  So we just want to make sure that we're all operating off the same assumptions of what numbers that we're talking about.

19:30 - Charis Siau
  Noted. Cool.

19:32 - Athena Simpson
  So then this margin is SDE margin. So not net profit, not EBITDA, it's SDE specifically, if that's more than 20%.  And then we want to, you know, really a red flag for me, and this came up on a couple of cashes deals.  If it's south of 15%, then I want us to dig into, is this industry average? Average and how volatile is the margins.  Anything south of 15% makes me nervous for a new buyer that doesn't have experience in that industry because it's just so little to work with there if something goes wrong.  So that's kind of an analysis thing here is like, is it more than 20%? That to me is a value add.  If it's less than, then again, we need to be digging into that when we're doing our analysis of what's the market kind of, what's the typical margin in this industry?  And is this business in line with that or typically below it? If it's below it, then, you know, that could be a potential big risk for a new client taking it on, especially if the client doesn't have industry experience in that.  Any questions on this one? Good. And again, this is most recent year usually that I'm looking at here. But when you're looking at margins too, when you're looking at the last three years, I look for big variabilities or swings.  You know, if you've got that much data in the P&Ls or the SIM, is there huge differences either in margins or costs of goods sold or expenses, cash, you're really good at kind of picking up on those things and looking at those nuances.  So if y'all are looking at like more than one year, also paying attention to, am I seeing big changes in margins or expenses or COGS relative to the revenue, right?  So is the margin or the percentage staying roughly the same? If there's big changes, like one year, the SCE margin is 50%, the next year it's 20%, the next year it's, you know, whatever percent, then that's a question for the broker.  Like, hey, what's going on there? You know, like, why are the margins changing so significantly? Unfortunately, Cash, this is, you know, Charis will probably be familiar with this.  What can often happen the year before a sale is that the seller would do a whole bunch of things to inflate their SDE.  They'll start making cost-cutting measures to inflate the SDE, and it's not, it's to sell the business or to make the numbers look better, as opposed to actually run the business the way it's been run historically in the past.  So that's why you want to look for those variances, because it's like, are they doing some stuff to try to make the numbers look better?  Because every dollar of SDE that they can find, they get paid three, four times that dollar in the sale.  So, again, you know, it's like the scorecard kind of gives you a map of things to start, like, exploring, right?  Like, what's happening with this? What's happening? What's happening with this? Contracted recurring revenue, more than 30% of the business having recurring or contracted revenue is awesome because they give some, you know, sustainability there.  Equally, it's something for someone to dig into, like what kinds of contracts are they? Are they annual contracts? If so, when did they receive the money and do we have a WIP situation?  WIP stands for work in progress, which means our buyers are going to have to do this whole thing during due diligence of figuring out how much of the work was delivered by the seller, how much is going to have to be delivered going forward, and where do we get, where do we meet in the middle of how much money is retained by the seller and how much needs to be left in the business for the new owner to deliver the work that's already been paid for.  So yet another, it's like, it's a value add, but also now. very man. you. I need to ask a whole bunch of questions to kind of figure out what's going on there.  Owner out of the day-to-day operator in place, like this should be only given a yes if there is, in fact, like a general manager running the day-to-day and the owner's not getting involved in operations in any way.  Sales, customer conversations, nothing. Like they're literally doing nothing. Does that make sense there? Cool. The remote or relocatable operations, this is what I wanted to dig into.  So if there is a physical presence of the current business and the owner is physically present in any way, then it does not get a remote or relocatable.  I should probably split these out. So remote is like. Like the owner doesn't physically go in anywhere. So this came up on, I think, one of Cash's deals that we'll talk through specifically.  But like if the owner's going and visiting customers or if the owner's physically meeting with like team or anything in any way, then SBA is going to expect that the new owner also does the same.  So we need to bear that in mind where our clients have geo restrictions. If they're not willing to go relocate somewhere for three, six, 12 months to make that transition, then, you know, that's where we can bring the deal here and talk about it.  But the SBA will have the expectation that if the whatever the owner is currently doing, that the new owner will have to do.  So if the owner, current owner is not remote, then we wouldn't give this a yes. And relocatable means that it could be be.  Moved to a different designation, but there's a caveat with relocatable. like, where is the current operations? And does our client feel okay about potentially spending three, six, 12 months at this business's location to move it to where they are?  So this is going to be a nuanced thing with every single client. SBA doesn't like it when people try to buy businesses where they are not physically present if the current owner is physically present there.  Does that make sense? Cool. So like with Lindsay and Kevin, for example, I just floated with them over the weekend.  Media agency is doing awesome and they're going fully remote next month, which is... Almost a year from when they bought it.  They closed in October of last year. And it's like September where they're going to finally go fully remote. So Kevin and Lindsay have been living this like split life for almost a year.  And they were like, if we had kids, if we like, they're like, there's no way we could have done this, you know?  So it's just something for you guys to think about when we're looking at these like nuanced opportunities. What would it take realistically to make it a remote business or a relocated business?  And is the client willing to do that? Some of our clients are like, yeah, if I have to go there for three or six months, you know, but if it's going to be for 10 years, I'm not willing to do that.  Like Gil's one of those people that had that conversation with himself and he was potentially open to it, you know?  So you guys will need to get to know each of the clients individually in terms of like, what are they really willing to do?  Um, what's their kid's home situation? Are they going to be okay with them potentially being away for a couple months at a time?  Um, et cetera. Is that clear on this one? It's again, nuanced, but does the definition at least make sense for the, for this?  Okay, cool. Strong SOPs. So this means documented playbooks and they actually have like documented SOPs and playbooks. And we need to validate this.  If we're going to say this as a yes, um, because one of the hardest things for a new owner is extracting all of the information out of the owner's heads.  So even though they might have a team that's functioning without them, if it's not all written down somewhere, this doesn't get a yes.  So we just want to verify like, Hey, you know, okay. If there's a day-to-day operator in place, awesome. Do they have written SOPs somewhere?  Do they have playbooks? Do they have operations manuals? How are they all operating? Because that is a risk to the new owner.  Say you've got a day-to-day operator GM in place, but there's nothing written down. New owner comes in, GM doesn't like him, quits.  What do you do?

29:21 - Ryan Cash
  That one I probably have a question on, Athena. Yeah, cool. So that's probably something that out of all of these things is the least likely that's going to be in a SEM.  And it's definitely not, at least on my list of broker questions that I'm asking right now. Like, is that something that we should just categorically start asking in our broker goals?  That's probably going to be one of the more difficult ones to just get transparency or information on.

29:54 - Athena Simpson
  Totally. Usually brokers will call it out if it's in place because it's so rare. You know, so they'll usually be like, and there's operations manuals and SOPs.  It's a very rare thing that you're going to get. I would ask it if they're saying that the owner is fully out of the day, if it's like absentee owner, okay, is the written SOPs in place?  Like, how is the team operating without the owner? So I would ask it, like, if they're saying there's some remote absentee kind of situation.  Well, remote actually doesn't necessarily need it. Like, if it's a team like us, you know, like, we could run this business without SOPs.  Not ideal. But, you know, most businesses don't have them. Charis, were you going to say something, add something there?

30:45 - Charis Siau
  Yeah. On one of my scorecards, you had called that piece out for mine because I had marked it yes.  In the SIM, this is why I said yes. It says all procedures are meticulously recorded. Only through standard operating procedures, but also comprehensive visual documentation, including pictures and videos.  So I marked it, yes. I don't know anything beyond that, but it seemed like it was a pretty important piece.  So that's why I marked yes. But now I understand very much why to include that in the write-up, because that is a really big benefit.  But so 100%, like it gives the new owner some form of security, right?

31:32 - Athena Simpson
  Like if you lose your number two or key personnel, which you will, like it's very rare to take over a business and have 100% of the team stay.  Great if they do, but it's like yet another risk mitigation if they have that kind of documentation already in place.  Because, you know, basically what we have to tell or what we tell clients is like day one, you're running around off the owner, around after the owner and documenting everything you're extracting.  everything from their head, you know? So if it's already been done, that's a huge value add. And if it does call it out in the SIM or if the broker does tell you that, absolutely call it out in the write-up because it's awesome and rare.  So that tells you something about how the business is run too if the owner's thinking about like, oh, let me actually document all these processes.

32:23 - Charis Siau
  Yeah. Okay. Awesome.

32:28 - Athena Simpson
  Cool. Does that clear that one up? I called it out, Charis, because I was like, you know, while I'm doing the reviews, I'm not deeply reading the SIMs and everything like that.  So sometimes it's like, hey, have we verified this? Or B, if it's not verified, then we shouldn't include it on the score.  This one out of everything is probably the least important to get answered. But like I said, Cash, you know, Charis saw in a SIM and the broker called it out because it is rare.  So you Usually they will call it out when something like that is in place, which is awesome. But if they're claiming, which a lot of them will claim, absentee business, like, that's awesome.  How are the team operating without the owner? Is there manuals? Are there processes written down somewhere? How are they knowing what to do without the owner?  Oh, they don't have any of that in place. It's like, okay, is the owner truly absentee then? How are the team knowing what to do without the owner's input?  Does that help answer or clear that one up? Yeah, great. Okay, cool. So, cool. Now, value subtractor. Any questions on the value adder section?  Sweet. Okay. So let's leave these as is. And then any adjustments that you think are like, this is a random thing unique to this business.  Just, you can add it into this section here. But let's not. Let's Change this section when we're doing the scorecards.  And then also, please use the notes column if you're giving a score, like just saying why you've given it that score.  That's super helpful. And also, I'm trying to train us all into using this in a way that in the future, we're going to be putting these on the client's dashboards along with the write-up also.  So it's just good practice for us to be filling in the notes. So imagine this is client-facing, even though it's not.  Like, you know, that might help you guys with filling this out. Like, what would I need to call out to the client in this instance if I was putting this scorecard on their dashboard?  Sweet. Okay. So key me on risk. Almost always, this is going to be a yes, unless the owner has, in fact, extracted themselves from the business.  If they're saying absentee owner, then I would be like, okay, where? Where are the leads coming in from? Who has the supplier relationships?  know, like just asking questions around that if they're claiming absentee. So like verify that. Who's giving the team direction on a day-to-day basis?  Um, it's, it's pretty rare. I mean, Alex's team said under 3 million in EBITDA that you don't have key man risk is, is usually what they're looking at.  So almost every business that we're looking at will have some form of key man risk. Um, I feel like that one's pretty straightforward, but let me know any questions on that.  Good. Cool. Okay. Uh, key clients, a revenue concentration. So this is one client accounting for more than 30% of the revenue.  This is really important to ask up front. Um, just ask if there's any client concentration that we should. know about or be aware about.  Sometimes they won't include it in the sim, but it can potentially make an SBA deal not happen, right? Like SBA hates, or SBA lenders, I should say, hate client concentration because it's a huge risk.  If you lose that key client, then 30% of the revenue goes away overnight. Right? It's not necessarily a deal breaker in our case because we can help the client structure their offer to include a forgivable note attached to that client concentration.  So if there is client concentration, if you know the number, like put it in here in terms of like how much, you know?  So if it's more than 30%, then we want to know about it. How much is it? And, you know, then if they're calling it out that there's client concentration.  Then I would want to ask them questions like, how long has this person been a client? How sticky is this service or how easy it is?  Is this switch? You know? So imagine us trying to switch CRMs right now. Like it would be you can see Anke's face like, and you guys don't, you only see the deal pipeline.  Our sales pipeline is on HubSpot. Our application tracking system is on HubSpot. Like our website is on HubSpot. All of our phone numbers is on HubSpot.  Us changing CRMs right now is highly unlikely. So, you know, that's, that's when, when somebody has client concentration, then I'm like, well, how essential is their product to that person?  And how hard is it for that person to switch? If they're the only person that offers that, or if it's like, I, I would, I couldn't even imagine trying.  We to switch CRMs right now and retrain the whole team and everything else that goes with that. Like HubSpot's brilliant.  That's why it's a  listed company because, you know, they get you in there and you just use it, use it, use it, expand, expand, expand.  And the pain in the  factor of us having to switch is too much that we probably won't ever, you know.  So when you see a key client risk, like asking questions around that, because it might be, our clients will be like, ah, client concentration, I'm out, I'm bailing.  And it's like, well, hang on a minute, you know, it's a HubSpot situation or, and, or we can structure your offer so that you, you know, the note can be forgiven if there's client concentration.  Um, does that, that makes sense in terms of that one? Cool. So if we're like customer.

39:00 - Charis Siau
  Concentration at 20-25%, we're going to note it, but don't mark it off for points.

39:07 - Athena Simpson
  Yeah, it's a good call out though, like any key customer, you know, concentration, whatever, like, does the top three customers make up a certain amount, whatever.  Um, so yeah, um, I'm just seeing time. So, um, let me blast through the rest of these and then, uh, we'll pull up cashes, deals, and see where we get to.  Revenue volatility, so just changes in revenue or, you know, like financial volatility. If there's a massive swing in COGS, if there's a massive swing in expenses, um, you know, so.  Sure.

39:55 - Ryan Cash
  Athena, what are the actual like SBA guidelines on revenue volatility?

40:03 - Athena Simpson
  It's nuanced. So if they're just on a steady decline, decline, decline, decline, and there's no story for it, then they'll usually not be cool with it.  But it's more about the story, the reason behind it. If it's declining because the owner got diagnosed with cancer, that's a story potentially that could be overcome with a new owner that's going to give it the kind of energy.  So if you see that volatility, that's where you want to be asking questions. Broker's the best one to ask these questions to because the owner's a little bit harder in the early stages.  So like, you know, they'll be getting these questions from everybody too, if it's there. So if they haven't answered it in the sim and given a good reason for it.  Um, you want to talk about it.

41:02 - Ryan Cash
  Okay. I just didn't know if there were like any hard and fast, like deal breakers to be on the lookout for.

41:08 - Athena Simpson
  Well, I mean, like Luke looked at a deal for one of our clients and it's with benchmarks. So they do the whole thing where clients have to sign the NDA and everything.  then we get the SIM and it's like 90% client concentration. It's like, that's just a  deal breaker. Right. Um, one, one client is just a non-starter for, for most of our clients.  Um, with the revenue volatility, what I'm looking for is what's the story? Is it something that our client could potentially overcome?  And, and is it how big of a potential risk is it for a new buyer? And seeing if I can ask the questions, like, well, is this a temporary thing with a new leader in energy?  Or is it a market trend? Or is it something else going on there? Or That, you know, we should be asking about and being able to convey that story as to why that's happening.  You know, usually it's like a COVID thing. Like I said, it appears like it was a drop in 23, 24, but it's actually just normalization post-COVID like spike.  Sound good? Okay, cool. Um, single supplier, so like only one person supplying a product or single acquisition channel. Like if they're only getting clients through word of mouth or the majority, like more than 50% of their sales come from one acquisition channel, then that's a single channel risk.  Let's say more, 50%. Does that help? Um, any questions on that one? Any Okay. Heavy, non-recurring CapEx. This was one that showed up on Cash's deal that I wanted to talk through because this bit me in the  when I was looking at a business myself, when I was like a new searcher.  And like, it's just not really talked about much. So I wanted to make sure that we called it out because it was a good example for all of you to kind of like see and learn through.  Um, but often it won't be called out there. So like heavy CapEx is like an event rental equipment business where you're constantly having to buy stuff.  Right. And it doesn't hit the P&L because it's seen as an investment in the business or like heavy machinery or, you know, things that are bought, they're put on the balance sheet that don't hit the P&L, but you need cash for it.  So that transportation business cash, the, the, the, the that you guys should always be looking at. The P&Ls is depreciation.  And if you see a huge depreciation number every year, then that means that they are making capital expenditures. They're buying things for the business that is considered an investment into the business, but it doesn't come out in the P&L and it won't show up in SCE or the P&Ls, but it is real cash that typically needs to be spent.  So I think you guys were on the Buyer's Club where I was explaining this the other day. I was looking at an event rental business.  It was $3 million adjusted EBITDA. But when I found out what the expenditures were to buy new rental equipment every year, they were spending $1.5 million a year on equipment.  So it was actually only a $1.5 million SCE business. But the way financials are done, it doesn't show up on the P&Ls, which is  frustrating.  So the depreciation number is where you guys should be looking. So if you're seeing large depreciation numbers. you're depreciation numbers,  That's when I'd be getting on with the broker and being like, what are the depreciation numbers for? Is this like recurring CapEx expenditures?  Make sense? I would just, I'm just going to like, even if it's non-recurring, it's still like heavy CapEx to me.

45:24 - Ryan Cash
  Yeah, I was about to ask that. Like, does it really matter if it's recurring or non-recurring? No, yeah.

45:30 - Athena Simpson
  mean, even maintenance CapEx, if they're not calling it out and you have to like keep buying equipment every single year, right?  That's going out of your cash flow. That affects your free cash flow. Cool on this one. Any questions? Good.  Okay. Cash business or poor books. Like if they're saying they don't have P&Ls or they're like, everything is in cash.  This is typically. typically. On the smaller businesses or like landscaping, construction, et cetera, you know, this is cash why I ask for P&Ls and always want to make sure that we have P&Ls when we hand it over to clients.  If we don't have P&Ls, then we at least need to have asked for it and have an answer why we don't have them.  Usually it's a bit of a red flag if they're like, oh, you'll get it after LOI. Like probably the seller's handwritten some sort of P&L statement.  So we want to see those.

46:32 - Anke Jordaan
  Which we have seen before, handwritten P&L statements.

46:36 - Athena Simpson
  So it happens. 100%, yeah. Or cash businesses where the owner's just like, oh, I've got a whole bunch of cash, you know.  It doesn't necessarily mean it's not financeable. Like it was a real shame. Jason had a equipment manufacturing or sorry, a Skylight manufacturing business off market under LOI doing a million in SDE.  And the owner. And owner. Or just use this like ancient accounting system. And all Jason needed to do is pay someone to go into the office and like transfer it over to QuickBooks.  And he would have had the financial statements to buy this business, but he wasn't willing to do that. So, you know, that hurt us all on that one.  Seasonality. So like, you know, roofing businesses doing well when there's storms, or, you know, if certain businesses shut down during winter or whatever, like if there's any sort of seasonality to the business, or cash like you picked up with the crypto thing, like, you know, dependent on market trends are just not predictable.  Project based. This is like, you know, doing a construction project for someone. It's a specific project, might not get new clients.  So when it is project-based, just make sure you put notes on, like, the types of projects. What's the likelihood that a customer will be a repeat customer?  What are the lengths of projects? How much are the size of the projects? So just getting more information on what project-based actually means.  Multiple owners creates complexity, especially when multiple owners are leaving. So this is where you guys want to dig into what's the roles and responsibilities of all the owners.  Did they account for it properly in the ad backs? So a lot of times they'll just add all the owner salaries back and not do a negative ad back to account for whoever you're going to need to hire to replace multiple people.  Um, that's naughty broker or just unsophisticated broker doing that. Um, typically. tract . Thank Typically, we add back one, we'll add back all the owner's salaries and then do a negative add back to replace an owner.  So really what the SDE should be reflecting is only one owner's salary being added back. So if you guys come across this, like, just shout out and, you know, we can look at it and because it's a nuanced thing.  But we've seen this happen before where brokers will just add back all the owner's salaries, not do a negative add back.  And it's like, well, it should be one for one. SDE is written as one owner's benefit, not multiple.

49:38 - Ryan Cash
  Oh, that's new to me. That's okay. I was wondering about that because sometimes you'll have like three that are all working like full time hours and they're adding like three salaries back for like three people with like 120 hours.  a week that they're working.

49:55 - Athena Simpson
  So if they do that, then you should see a negative number in the add. Back section for market salary to replace two of the three.  If they're not doing that, then we need to call that out. Right. So, and I would be talking to the owner about that or the broker, like, Hey, I see you've added back three salaries here.  Have you done a negative ad back or have you looked at what market salary is going to be to replace two of them?  You know, because like it's one for one when we're, when we're reviewing it, SDE is basically just like EBITDA way for us to like value businesses.  So it's, it's not a good brokers will, will do, you know, negative adjustments for whatever. So like one, one owner is doing the bookkeeping, one owner is doing the blah, blah, blah, and they'll do a negative adjustment to the SDE for whatever market salary would be to have that person hired.  So multiple owners, we really want to understand what's the roles and responsibilities of everybody. Who's staying, who is not, you know, if they have equity in it, then there's all the complexities with SBA, the, oh, sorry, my brain just totally did a blank on me.  Um, what the dynamics are, those sorts of thing. Um, sorry, um, the dogs just made me laugh. Uh, yeah, so this is one we want to dig into here.  Um, equally when family members are involved in the business and they're staying on or they're departing or that sort of thing, even if they're not an owner, this just creates complexity and risk when we're buying.  Um, the businesses, um, sorry, I'm going to give us a couple of minutes on this. Um, questionable ad backs.  Um, This is, again, kind of a nuanced thing as we learned, but there's certain ad backs that SBA will be okay with it.
  ACTION ITEM: Share/link ad-backs template in scorecard. Ref for off-market deal eval.
 - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/383860717?timestamp=3123.9999  And there's a lot of ad backs that they just try to add back and they are taking liberties. So Anke, if we haven't already, let's share the ad backs template or maybe like put it as an additional thing in here or just link to it.  So like these are the ad backs when we're doing off market that we'll look for ourselves. And those are usually the okay ad backs.  Anything outside of that, that's when we want to like double click on that and see like how it's justified by the broker as to why it's an ad back.  Just real quick, Seller Note, if they're willing to offer more than 10% of the purchase price as a Seller Note, that's awesome.  Also indicative of there might be problems. So everything that's of value might be a problem. So we want to look into every single one of these things.  SBA pre-qualified, that's great. I mean. The lenders looked at it. Earn out like performance note options. So the revenue variability means that there is a performance note option, which can be a plus, you know, so we can structure things in a way to try to account for the volatility.  And then the market trends, you will need to look up. Sometimes it's in the SIM. Sometimes you can just ask ChatGPT, like, what's the market trend on this industry?  So depending on what percentage growth or decline it's in, you will add this adjustment to it. Right? So if it's a clearly declining industry, then it's a negative.  And even if it's like kind of flat to stagnant, it's still a negative. So it's only where it's like, you know, really moderately growing that we would add anything of value there.  So like I said, if there's other things that you think are like unique to this business that are super value add, then add them here.  But let's leave all this section. And then when you're reviewing the SIM, see if you can plug in the numbers and answer all the questions here.  And this should give you a guide of what questions to ask in addition to anything else that you're seeing in the SIM.  And if you're giving a score here, just make sure that it's reflected also in the write-up, whether it's a value add or a detractor.  We want to make sure that we're calling this out for the clients. And then in the future, when we refine this thing enough, we'll be including this.  So add everything in the notes as to why you gave it the score as if you were writing it for the client.  How's that all sound? Good. Okay. Cash. I realized we didn't get to your write-ups. So what I might do is see if we can find some time tomorrow to go through it, or I will just do a, I'm still sharing my screen.  And I will do a video that I will share with y'all, talk through everything. And, and I. I want everyone to watch it because it's just good, like, points for all of us to learn.  Sound good? Yeah, that's good.

55:09 - Ryan Cash
  Definitely would be appreciated. Help me get some clarity on what next steps are for some of those write-ups and where I'm at on.

55:16 - Athena Simpson
  Yeah, you got bingo, the bingo for, like, a bunch of just complexity things in there that are nuanced. So I was like, these are all good learning items.  And then I took up all the time going through the scorecard.

55:30 - Ryan Cash
  But it's good for us all to be working off the same assumptions with these things. Is there any that are, like, so red flagged that they might not be going to clients?  Because that might help me determine my workflow schedule on do I need to prioritize? Because we're trying to get first write-ups out to these.
  ACTION ITEM: Research typical profit margins for flooring/carpet industry. Compare to Federico deal.
 - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/383860717?timestamp=3347.9999  I have the one for Federico, the flooring carpet company. That's really the kind of best shot on goal I've got for him right now.  Federico, I'm concerned on the margin.

56:00 - Athena Simpson
  I'm seriously concerned on the margins. So do some market research on what like normal margins are in that type of business.

56:09 - Ryan Cash
  That's the normal margins on that one? Industry. Yeah. Okay.

56:15 - Athena Simpson
  And then the other flag that I had was real estate on that one. So let me go back and review that one.  And Michael, I know you had two, the Tampa one I am concerned about, given the, like, he's in Atlanta.
  ACTION ITEM: Review/update Michael's geo prefs. Verify Tampa/FL accuracy. Note 2yr HS constraint.
 - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/383860717?timestamp=3383.9999  That's in his geography, though.

56:34 - Ryan Cash
  Like, we have Tampa in his geography map. Like, is that something that we should not be having then?

56:40 - Athena Simpson
  I thought Tampa was for SP.

56:43 - Ryan Cash
  It's also the greater Tampa area we have for Michael. There's overlap on both those. So SP and MW are both in Atlanta, and they're also in the greater Tampa area.  MW is actually even better. Greater than that. So he's got a very big portion of Florida. Might be questionable as well.  I don't know if that's accurate because he's told us he has this daughter in high school and he's not looking to move until she graduates in like two years.
  ACTION ITEM: Investigate Tampa biz owner's physical presence. Client/employee interactions on-site?
 - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/383860717?timestamp=3436.9999  But we also have Florida like listed for him right now. But regardless, there's that question. Sorry, Cash, I need to run.  Well, so dig into whether the current owner is physically on site for any client conversations, employee conversations, anything.

57:39 - Athena Simpson
  If the current owner is doing anything physically in Tampa, it's not a remote business. We got Buyers Club now.  I got to run to the bathroom. But we can circle back on all this. Anke, let's find some time maybe for all of us.  Tomorrow to go through this because it's all kind of important stuff. Sure.

57:59 - Anke Jordaan
  Okay. Okay.

58:01 - Athena Simpson
  Good. Okay. I'll see you guys in a minute. Thanks.
