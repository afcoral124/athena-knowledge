# AcquiMatch Buyers Club 12/06/2024

[00:00:00] 

**Athena:** Hey justin

**Justin:** Hello. 

**Athena:** Hey, how's it going? 

**Justin:** How's it going? Good. 

**Athena:** Um, I think Polly might be here too. We're, we don't have a ton of clients joining today, but, uh, excited to see you and hear a little bit about your big deal too. There's Polly. With sound, we got you. Can you hear me? Good. Yeah, we can hear you.

Cool. Um, well, welcome, Polly. You, uh, you were here on the one on Tuesday. Um, we've got a lot more clients that are joining, but just wanted to give a kind of regular opportunity for y'all to jump in and discuss deals and then also do learning sessions as well.

So, um, we'll go ahead and kick off and then if more people join, great. But we, um, just opened up that channel. Today for y'all to chat in between these meetings to and resources and that sort of thing. So it's not an absence of our [00:01:00] support, but it is. There's another place to just connect with other people that are on the same journey and in the same place as you.

So, what we're going to cover today, and we're recording this, so there'll be a replay afterwards and you can refer back to it. But the agenda today is going to do a quick tour of the Slack channel. So, There's a couple of features that are in it. So how you can use it and get the most out of it. I'm also going to quickly show you a new resource that we put on the dashboard that will help kind of demystify all the jargon just something that you can constantly refer to.

And then I wanted to just do a deep dive on the three different types of seller notes that can be used in an SBA deal because your lender is not going to necessarily tell you about any of these because they don't get interest on seller notes. So I wanted to give you guys kind of just a deep dive on the seller notes because I was putting together, I was like, okay, here's my SBA tips, you know, and, We have an internal document that we use to keep up to [00:02:00] date and then I was kind of beefing it out for you all.

And I was like, I could literally spend like 10 hours just on SBA. So I decided to just talk about the seller notes in an SBA deal today because I think that's 1 of the things that will help you. All with where you're at, and when you're looking at structuring and just keeping those tools in mind and what to look out for.

So, uh, and then if we have, um, we'll, we'll have some time at the end. So we can chat questions want to talk deals. I know Justin's actively working a deal. So I'd love to. Get a little update on that too, but, um,

just thinking, okay, Justin, you met Anca and Ryan Luke. Do you just want to unmute and introduce yourself really quick since you haven't met Justin yet? 

**Luke:** Yeah. Hey, Justin. Nice to meet you. I'm Luke. I'm a newer member of the team. I'm calling right now out of Southern California. My past experience before joining here was in investment banking and corporate finance.

And I recently did a consulting project this last summer. Okay. So, nice to meet you, Justin. Nice, [00:03:00] likewise. 

**Athena:** Cool. And then Polly and Justin, if you want to do a quick intro, like, who are you? Where are you? Any, like, epiphanies or top tips that you've gotten recently about deals? And if you're actively working a deal and want to do an update on that too.

**Polly:** Um, I'm Polly. My husband is Steve, and we're working together as as partners and trying to find our first business and we're located in Atlanta, actually Roswell, which is a suburb of Atlanta, if you're not familiar with down here and, um, we have looked at probably 3 or 4 deals and we are currently considering to, but have to do a little more deep dive on the financial pieces of it.

Um, and if it's gonna make sense financially, and then also, um. Just where the, I guess, one of the epiphanies, so to speak, has been, um, the seller being the business. And really just kind of wrapping our heads around the right questions to [00:04:00] ask and, and also just to really get a, a, a, a guess, a deeper look into what is it that they do very specifically in a week's time, in a day's time, on a day-to-day basis.

Um, how active are we going to have to be, you know, for that first year or so in really. Being being the owner ourselves, and so forth, because a lot of times there, there aren't a lot of employees and so forth. So they really are the business. And so, I guess, you know, what, what level do we want to be, because we're a little bit different.

We're not, we're not really looking to buy a job, but know that we have to be in it for at least 6 months to a year for that transition to potentially take place to like a manager and that kind of thing. So, I think we're just trying to. To learn to ask the right questions and, and do, you know, be a part of talking to enough of the sellers that are [00:05:00] presented to us that, um, we get a better feel for what we personally want and what we're able to do.

If that makes sense. 

**Athena:** Awesome. Thanks Holly. We're excited making moves. Justin, how are you? 

**Justin:** Uh, so I'm in North Jersey, just across the river from Manhattan. I've been looking at deals for a long time now. Uh, many deals. I got pretty close to one earlier this year. It was, um. Lab equipment manufacturing company, uh, ended up falling through.

Um, I got a lead from Athena and Ryan and the team, um, just a couple of months ago about a landscaping company out here in New York, um, that I am actively pursuing. And we have attorneys drafting up, um, uh, asset purchase agreement right now. So I should have something in writing. By the middle of next week, [00:06:00] and we'll kind of come through that because the.

The seller's attorney is the one that's drafting that and my attorney will take a look and we'll probably redline some stuff and go back and forth for a little bit. But, um, yeah, I'll be looking to close the beginning of next year. So, fun stuff. Yes. 

**Athena:** Yay. So excited and Justin if you want us to take a look at that and see if there's anything that jumps out before you sign it we're happy to do that too.

Perfect. Um. Awesome. Cool. Well, I'm excited to have you both here. Like I said, we're recording these so that there's resources available on the dashboard as well. So just really quickly wanted to get us on a tour of the Slack channel and how to use it because there's some cool features on there and information and stuff.

Uh, so over to you. Okay, 

**Anke:** perfect. Let me share my screen and then. Um, so I think [00:07:00] Justin and Polly, both of you are already in this, in this, uh, new Slack channel. So if you're not familiar with Slack, it's basically like a big text message for everybody to use. It's super fun and you can, um, you can react to stuff and you can even reply within a thread.

To reply to specific people. Um, so this is a great way for you guys to share resources, share ideas, share problems, you know, and then, because the whole team is also in this channel, we can jump in and we can also collaborate with you. At the top, you'll see there is three different tabs. The first tab is the information on what the Acquimatch Virus Club is.

This is the message that has been already sent you, but just if you wanted to recap on what was what we're going to talk about, you know, when this is happening, um, the next step is the upcoming dates and topics. So, this is the joining link, just in case, you know, the calendar [00:08:00] item gets lost. Sometimes that happens and these are the upcoming dates and then we will be making the upcoming topics available, you know, as they get planned.

And then at the bottom, I'm going to be adding all of the replay. So if you miss one, don't worry, I'll be adding the recording, the replay down here for you to go back to and watch, um, you know, when you have some time and then this tab, the deal request form. If you have a deal that you want us to talk about or take a look at on these calls, you just click on this green button that says start workflow.

It's going to pop up a form and then you can just write in your name. So we know who this is. Um, Right information about your deal, what you want to see or talk about. If you have an online drive file and you can add a link, just add the link [00:09:00] right here or if it's an actual file and you want to upload it, there's an upload button that you can just upload this file right here.

And then if you click submit, oh, it's asking me to upload. We'll just turn that off. So it's not. Required in case it's just a deal thing. So if you click submit this form now comes to us and then we have some time to review the information before the school. So, if you want to talk about something, please send it to us ahead of time.

So we have some time to, you know, go through it and and and great. Yeah, basically, that was it. Does anybody have any questions? About the tabs about slack, 

**Athena:** um, nice work on making that all super simple. Um, just just something to note, like, what kinds of things would you want to put on the form I've reviewed on the call that would be things like your financial modeling.

If you. [00:10:00] If you put together your modeling in the template and you want us to look at it, it's a really great learning opportunity for everybody to kind of see us doing that live because there's little tips that, like I said, I could talk about SBA loans for like 10 hours on the basis of information that we have.

So just seeing the modeling live, if you're brave enough, and you put it together, like, Hey, let's review it on the call. And then that way we can all give you ideas and talk through different ways of doing the modeling. Or if you want to, you know, or purchase agreement, or you're like, this would be great to get other people's input, or just share a learning opportunity where we all get to feed in on it.

Um, obviously, Brian and the team are always available to you all, but I'm going to try to always jump into these calls too. So I'll be able to feed back. Um, but, yeah, I'd say, like, you're modeling templates or any little documents or anything that comes up that you want reviewed. We'll be able to do that.

With you, and there's a lot of folks with a different experience here that might be able to build on, um, [00:11:00] whatever we've done too. So, um, great work on that. Cool. Any questions on the Slack channel? Hopefully very straightforward. Also, uh, for the benefit of, um. Justin Polly and hey, Steve, we'll have you do 2nd.

Um, we're going to be inviting experts to these calls in the future. So, um, we're already working with, um. Some lawyers to do a specific template that has all of the tips and tricks that we like to see in an ally. Um, so we're going to create a template with them and then they're going to come on and they're going to talk through, um.

The and what you want to think about when you're putting together your, then that template will be available for you to use. Um, and what's cool about that is then you can just pay for a document review, rather than paying a lawyer to, like, come up with a or whatever. And then, you know, it's, it's got all the things that we typically like to see in there, too.

Um, we're also working with amazing [00:12:00] provider who does financial due diligence on deals and he's going to come on and. Walk through a quality of earnings report, um, so you can actually see what's in there and what you should be looking for before you get into due diligence that can avoid you some costly mistakes down the line, but then also, so you can see what's in a queue of the report.

Like, what can I expect? And what is that going to tell me about the deal? And why am I spending money on that? So that's fun. Um, we're gonna work on bringing an SBA person based on our conversation with Lindsay last time of, like, how do you present yourself? And. Go and pitch and that sort of thing. So, um, there's some cool stuff and really everything that we're going to try to do here is to impart as much wisdom on to you, bring you together and get y'all, you know, closing, you know, making offers on deals sooner and better and, uh, all that stuff.

So it should be fun. Um, so that's a little preview of what ahead and Steve, I've just seen you, uh, join us. So you want to just [00:13:00] really quickly do a quick hello. Where are you? And, uh, any epiphanies or tips that might be useful to share with everybody here? 

**Steve:** Yeah. Hey, so hi everybody. Uh, Steve gang and literally one floor below my wife that's on this call as well.

So, um, based in Atlanta, Georgia. Uh, you know, as far as, you know, background and with Athena now for it's going on almost a year. So, uh, definitely through this year and just excited to be here. It's been some learning along the way. I think, you know, there's a lot of folks that I've heard. I listened in on the last call a little bit as well.

But, you know, it's process and understanding the process, having a coach to guide you through, uh, some of the unknowns and getting the reps in, as I like to say, uh, it's, it's been really good and looking forward to, I guess, leaning on the community as well, uh, from some of your insights and, and, um, you know, areas of, uh, [00:14:00] Expertise.

So from a background, I, uh, I'm in a large corporate environment. Uh, been in sales marketing, spent 11 years on wall street and in tech sales for about 27 years now. So I can date myself. Uh, but you know, anything around sales marketing and all that good stuff. That, uh, started in, uh, you know, own small businesses.

So it's something that I've been around a lot of my life. I was the, the one who went corporate. So, uh, trying to work back into that, into, uh, into this realm. So looking forward to. 

**Athena:** Awesome. Thanks, Steve. Cool. Well, let's dive in. So we've got, uh, I've got a resource that I just want to share with you really quickly.

So let me pull up my screen. Um, so on your, uh, all all of your notion dashboards, the resources for clients have and, um. We are gonna be dropping the [00:15:00] recordings from these calls there. Also, we're always adding resources, so, um, you know, making sure that you're checking in. There's a pre and post LOI checklist and process.

It's really important to read through and get to know before you get to that point. There's an amazing due diligence tracker that onca created that tracks hundreds of pieces of documentation in a really straightforward way. And we've just recently added this 1 on 1 definition. So it's essentially like.

A straightforward explanation of different words that you're going to hear, and most of you will know most of them, but some might come up and you're like, I don't know what that means. So, you know, just keeping that it's a PDF document, keeping that to hand so you can. Demystify things like, um, you know, stuff that's going to come up as like J curve or earn out when you start talking to SBA, you know, those sorts of [00:16:00] goodwill.

What does that mean? So these words are defined in what we hope is plain English. So you just have a reference guide and you can kind of upskill through that as well. So that's on the dashboard now. Um, And there's 9 pages in there, and there's probably a lot that we could still continue to add. So if there's any words definitions of things that we didn't add in here, like, hit us up, let us know and we'll, we'll keep adding to it.

So, um, I don't know about you, but I certainly when I started my search felt like it was learning a completely new language. So. Want to try to help you all out with that. So that's on the resources dashboard. Um, now, the other thing that I wanted to talk through today was the different types of seller notes in deals.

So this is specifically when you are going to be using some form of SBA. Um money in your deal. So this is different from doing like a hundred percent seller finance Um, because there's certain things that are allowed and not [00:17:00] allowed when you're using sba financing So all of these things are allowed under certain circumstances, and that's what I want to talk about today So one of the things that's really important is when you're structuring your deal You do not want to rely on the lender to tell you how to structure it and when I mean structure it it's You know, how much of a seller note are you putting in if at all?

Um, are you going to do forgivable notes? Are you going to bring in investor equity? Any of those types of things? Lender is going to want you to max out the loan amount with them because that's where they get paid. They get the interest on that and they're highly risk averse and they're also not necessarily like, creative when it comes to financing.

They just are looking at it from their lens. So the lender is a really great resource to help you see where red flags are. Um, you know, and we'll help you get things done, but when it comes to the structuring solely relying on the lender can often mean that you miss out on some of these opportunities to make a much [00:18:00] more competitive offer or overcome some of the challenges that they're seeing.

So, um, I wanted to share this. Let me do view. Let's see full screen. Here we go. Um, wanted to share the 3 different types of seller notes that you can use in an SBA deal. And then we can talk about it if you have any questions, but just so you can be thinking about this when you go through deals. Um, so a straight up seller note.

Is essentially just a loan. It's another loan. It's another piece of debt. Um, and maybe you're going to be able to get the seller to take a smaller interest rate than what you're currently getting. Um, and. When you're using SBA, it is subordinated to the SBA loan, which means the SBA lender gets paid first if there are any financial issues with the business.

So it means that if a seller's agreeing to take just a straight up seller note in a deal with you that has SBA [00:19:00] financing, then they are at risk of not getting paid if there's not enough money to pay both. Um, what's cool about traditional seller notes is you can sometimes negotiate better interest rates.

To help your debt service coverage ratio, and you can amortize it over different amounts of time. So amortization means how many years are you paying this over? How many years, uh, do you have to pay the loan? Um, so sometimes with seller notes also for you to help with your debt service coverage ratios.

Especially in those 1st, couple of years, which has a J curve, which is typically 1st or 2nd year of ownership. You're going to have a drop. In revenue or profit, either because there's some instability with the transition or you're investing into the business. So it goes down and then it goes up like a J.

so with seller notes, you can sometimes [00:20:00] negotiate interest payments for, like, the 1st, 2 years on this and then you'll accelerate the payment. Something that I didn't put in this, but I will discuss later is, is what's called a balloon payment. So it means you say, okay, I'm going to pay you as if I'm paying you over the next 10 years, but in year 5, I'm going to just do a lump sum of whatever's left on that loan.

Um, we'll talk about that a little bit later, but, um, it's, you know, with seller notes, you can negotiate. Um, a lot of different things here. You know, can reduce the amount that you need from SBA. Um, but when you're layering in seller notes, you need to make sure that your debt service coverage ratio still works.

Right? So, the bank has to sign off any and all debt and financial structuring when you're using SBA, so they're going to look at everything and, like, you know, taking out debt. Um, to get debt, they don't [00:21:00] like it unless the numbers all work and the debt service coverage ratio is still really healthy in the way that they like to see it.

So, um, an example of that would be like, let's say the purchase price or total project cost is 1, 000, 000. You're going to pay 900. Up front through SBA, and then the seller provides a 100 K note repaid over 5 years. So they'll get 900 of the purchase price at close. And then they will get paid out their original or the, uh.

What's left of that 100 K over 5 years. Does that all make sense on straight up seller note before I move on to the next 1? Yeah, I'm seeing some naughty. Okay, cool. Um, so then the next part, and this is what I like to see in in every deal if possible is I lost all the faces, um, is using seller notes as so, um.

The bank requires a 10 [00:22:00] percent equity injection, which means they want to see that you are bringing at least that they are not on the hook for at least 10 percent of the deal. Um, so that shows commitment and that somebody else has skin in the game that the bank is not fully taking all of the risk on the 10 percent now.

With the changes in the S. P. A. S. O. P. It's called, um, they've they've said that other forms of equity injection can count. So when you have a 10 percent equity injection requirement from S. B. A. If you were fully coming up with that yourself, then it reduces your buying power. So let's say you're doing a million dollar deal and the equity injection is 100k.

If you don't ask for any seller note as equity injection, then you'll have to come up with that entire 100k. But what's [00:23:00] super cool about this seller note as equity injection is you can say like, look, I'm going to pay you 95 percent of the purchase price to close. And I need you to take a 5 percent note.

You're going to be on full standby for 2 years. And that is what we are going to be using as reps and warranties. So what that means is the seller has some skin in the game for two years and it helps you protect against any fraud or misrepresentation, right? It gives you warranties and, and it protects against the representations of the business.

On top of that, you can use that five percent note as equity injection. So that means that the 10 percent that you have to come up with personally is now reduced to 5%, which doubles your buying power, just with asking the seller to take a 5 percent note, which is super reasonable, right? Like even 10 percent is usually reasonable.

And it [00:24:00] means that you were in a better position financially. You're able to go bigger if you want to, which is why when we take you all on, you see what SBA pre approves you at. And it's, you know, based on you providing the 10 percent yourself, but we know what the baseline is so that we can double that if you were to just negotiate a small 5 percent equity injection.

So what that means is they will be on Full standby for 2 years. So what that means is they're not going to get any payments towards the principal for the first 2 years, but you can make interest payments. So long as the debt service coverage ratio works, the bank signs it off. Um, so I love this because we have been able to get people to double and triple their buying power based on what they had available just with this 1 little tool.

Does that make sense on the equity injection portion?

Okay, cool. Now, this is my [00:25:00] favorite tool and something we've been using in structuring a lot lately is performance based forgivable seller notes. So it means that you can tie certain. It's like, think of it as a separate loan, right? Like, let's say you've got your purchase price of 1. 5 million, but the bank said, we're only comfortable with 1, 000, 000.

On this deal, and the debt service coverage ratio based on their, their most recent performance only works if you pay 1, 000, 000. Well, let's say the seller had one of those like crazy years that we talked about last time of like, they had a uptick in. After post COVID, where they had a big year and then they normalized after that back to a lower amount.

So the bank's looking like most recent sales, but, you know, in the past that the business is like, gotten a higher amount, you can then say, okay, Mr seller, I'm going to pay you 1. [00:26:00] 5, but only 1 of that is guaranteed the other 0. 5. We're going to tie it to you, helping me get the business back to that point in time that it was before.

And if you do that, I'm going to pay you that additional 0. 5 million, and I'm going to do it over this amount of time with this kind of interest rate, but it's only if you help me achieve that. So what that means is that you will say, but if we don't achieve that, then I, it's forgiven. I don't have to pay you that amount.

I'm only beholden to that 1, 000, 000 that we agreed. If we don't hit those targets that we set together. So this is an awesome tool when you want to get competitive and when you see a year in the past that was high and then maybe a drop later that you can use that now to be competitive and to make even more substantially good offers that incentivizes the seller and it protects you from the risk of that not happening.

So [00:27:00] the seller's like, well, I want 1. 5M and it's like, cool. Here's how we're going to do it. We're going to attach it to making sure that we get revenue to this amount. And what's cool about performance based notes is you can attach it to anything. So you can say, like, okay, you have a customer concentration issue.

So if that main customer goes away, here's how much we're going to reduce that note by. Or you have a key man risk, right? There's a key person in business. And if that person walks, that puts me at jeopardy. So we're going to reduce the amount by that much. So, um, you know, it's, it's basically a contingent liability.

And it's defined on the criteria that you set. For example, revenue retention or increasing revenue, customer concentration, employee retention, um, and it must be expressly labeled as a forgivable performance based note. It can't be called an earn out. So an earn out is something that like private equity uses, and it's basically incentivizing [00:28:00] the seller to get the business up to the level it wants.

But with SBA land, if, you know, typically if it hasn't. Achieve that in the past, then you can't use a performance based note like that, because it's essentially an earn out. Which is I'm incentivizing the seller to increase the revenue, which is different. Um, I mean, I'm incentivizing the seller to increase the revenue back to what it was in a previous point in time.

Um, so lender obviously has to approve these and I think it's important to note that. And I should have said this at the beginning, and this is what I'll go into when we do more SBA deep dives, but every lender evaluates. The guidelines differently, every lender has its own criteria for how they evaluate deals.

So, if 1 lender says, no, we can't do that. We'll take it as gospel. Right? It might be that lender that bank says no, but it's not necessarily. An SBA that you can find a different lender. So, like, Lindsay, who [00:29:00] was on the call last time went to 7 different lenders to get her deal done. And there was, there was a customer concentration issue that we overcame with that.

She had 3 different notes in that deal. Um, 1 of which was a performance based note to get it back to previous targets that they'd achieved and also helped with customer concentration. Um, so. What's really important with these is that performance based notes must be of benefit to the buyer when used with SBA.

So it can't put the buyer at a disadvantage. So when it's being structured and if it's being structured by you, then it needs to be to your advantage. And I love it because it mitigates risk. It allows you to be competitive. And, and it just gives you a tool that You know, it's a private equity tool under the right circumstances, right?

That you're able to incentivize them and it gets the owner bought in. So you get them, you know, not only, um, helping you through the transition, but [00:30:00] incentivize to make sure that that transition goes well.

Any questions on performance based forgivable seller notes?

Cool, that's all I was going to talk about with uh, seller notes and SBA today. Any thoughts, questions, did that all make sense? Does it make you excited about structuring?

**Steve:** So I have a question for you. Yeah. What, what percentage of the deals that you see getting closed have a seller note and a performance based note? How common is it? 

**Athena:** Well In our deal is very common because we, we, it's a tool we love, you know, but it's not really talked about there in the world very much.

And like, again, the lender is not going to recommend that because if you are like, we'll pay [00:31:00] an extra half a million, and there's not getting the interest on that. So, they're not necessarily going to tell, they're just going to tell you what they want to see. Right? Um, so on the deals that have that.

Available, I like to see it included in some way, because as a 1st time buyer, especially if you don't have industry experience, you want the owner bought in in some way and there's no risk to you. If the business doesn't achieve those targets, but there's only upside if it does so. Um, I'd say probably see a proportionally high amount of deals, but the performance based forgivable note in it, because it's a tool we love, and it's not really talked about.

It's not really utilized as much as I think it should be. But at the very least, I do like to see the 5 percent equity injection from the seller. Um, which, you know, it increases like. Even if you have the 10 percent available, it makes sure that you get them bought in. And even if you don't [00:32:00] do that, you're still probably going to want to put some money in escrow for that REFs and warranties if your lawyer is advising you from the right place.

Because what if the seller completely misrepresents everything? You buy the business and you have nothing to claw back because you paid them 100%. Right. So like one way or another, they're going to have to put some of that purchase price aside better for them to earn interest on it and, and be able to get more money if you're able to bump up the purchase price, because you're buying power increase as a result of doing that.

**Polly:** I have a quick question for you. So, and you might've actually said this and I missed it, but if you're looking on the performance side, if you're looking at. You know, say two years ago or what have you, um, when it, when it, they have their highest revenue or their highest sales. Is there a certain tenure of time that they look back at?

In other words, if the, if the, you know, company had been in business for 20 [00:33:00] years, is it like three to five years that they're looking at just the past three to five years? 

**Athena:** That's a really good question. Polly. I actually, I don't know if there's a time limit on it. Um, I want to, I want to ask, um, 1 of our letters and find out as far as I know.

No, like, if the, if, if the business achieved it in the past. 

**Anke:** Okay, 

**Athena:** then you saying I want to achieve that again, isn't an earn out. It's just you getting the business back on track to a level that it was at before. Um, and I think as long as it's on tax returns and verifiable that they're okay with that, but it's a great question.

So that's my assumption. We'll go and get the answer and we'll, we'll feedback in the channel on that question. 

**Polly:** And then just 1 more question. Um, if you go above that number, let's say, you know, on performance or what have you go above that best number. Is there anything that has to be put in as a clause or anything like that?

Like, working the numbers and so forth or. What happens about that? 

**Athena:** [00:34:00] I've seen it. What's interesting is, like, again, this is 1 of those, like, nuance things and based on the lender, but I've seen it structured where, like, the year 2 targets were actually higher than what was achieved. In the previous year, so it's like, you're 1, we want to achieve back what was achieved previously in your 2 and I've seen that, um, get approval letters before.

So. Okay. Um, I, I think as long as there was like a proof of it happening in the past, then I don't think there's a tag as long as it's reasonable. But again, a great question and good to get clarity. Again, there's the clarity between what's an SOP guideline like that. SBA must follow, and what's the bank's preference, you know, like, there's, there's always, yeah, there is nuance, and it's sometimes hard to get them to be like, oh, no, that's a, that's an SBA thing, or that's a, our bank thing, you know, um, but great question.

I haven't, he, [00:35:00] I think, you know, a deal is that we were helping those performance, but it was a reasonable target. It was like a, you know, growth rate that was reasonable, and, and, um, not like, You need to grow it by 500 percent kind of thing. So I imagine there's like, a level of discernment.

But my understanding is that if you want to use the, the tool that there just has to be past performance to indicate that you can do something like that. So, again, great question. We'll get clarity on that. We'll answer it in the channel. Thank you. No worries

any other questions.

**Anke:** Oh, 

**Athena:** Justin, are you using any? Uh. I am not not 

**Justin:** for this 1. no, this is going to be a pretty straightforward deal for [00:36:00] for us. 1 of the main reasons is because a lot of his work is going to be booked before I even take over. He does everything well, I won't say everything, but he does a bulk of his work under annual contracts.

So he's already sent out contracts for next year and he's getting them back. Um, so I already have a pipeline of not even a pipeline. I don't even want to call it that. I'll have signed contracts where, um, we basically have a good. Idea of what our revenue will be for, for the year. Um, it was just my job to make sure those guys are out in the field and doing their thing and, um, you know, driving up more business.

Uh, but I did have a pretty interesting, um, My, my previous deal, I did have performance based I had seller, uh, equity injection. I had [00:37:00] minority, uh, a minority owner already in the business. That was going to retain equity equity at a smaller portion. Um, so I've been, I've been down both routes. Um, so it is a powerful tool to make sure you have a seller, um, have some skin in the game, especially if you have a business that's performed well, like you said, and you want to get them back to that point.

Um, the 1st deal that I was just mentioning was exactly that post coded, um, they were doing really well pre coded post coded. They had a fall off. They picked it back up in 23. And the reason why the deal eventually fell through is because they were having such a good year this year. And we were in conversations early 23, when we were about to make this deal happen, he saw that 24 was going to be such a good year, probably a record, a record year for them.

They were like, I'm just going to wait until the end of 24. It'll be on my books. Um, and then I can just get. [00:38:00] Get the purchase price that I want. That's less complicated. I try to explain on that, you know. It's not only the, the last year that, that the banks look at, but he said he is gonna hit me up, uh, the beginning of next year.

So , 

**Athena:** so you might have another one to, to take down. 

**Justin:** He took, he took the business off market. It's not like we couldn't come to terms, he just, yeah, he said, um, I'm taking the business off market. I'm finishing the year. So yeah, I've been down both routes. Um, that's my, what did 

**Athena:** you learn from that, if anything?

That could. Be helpful for others. 

**Justin:** Um, try to vet out, um, your numbers if you can prior to stage. Um, I was told a wildly high number, um, [00:39:00] before. Before we signed a and got into due diligence. Um, and then when I got a detailed at back list, add backs, um, there was a lot of items on there that were not add backs.

Um, so, obviously, you go into those negotiations and you come up with a purchase price. And you say, yeah, I can, I can get you to your number based on the ad backs, you know, the profitability of your business and you get into due diligence. Um, and when you get into due diligence, you got some costs, right?

You got your, your financial, you got your legal. So you have your attorney of your accountants on board and you're paying them unless, um, you got some really good connections. So you're paying them some money and, um, come find out. They can't, uh, you know, add back, I don't know, whatever. I can't remember what it was for them.

Um, inflated salaries. [00:40:00] Numbers in that up on their on their tax returns, um, a bunch of different things. So, 

**Athena:** yeah, getting those ad backs as soon as possible and verifying them is a really great thing to do to Justin's point. Um, I'm just going to pull up the dashboard again, because I know some of the, some of you weren't, um, this is a newer thing to you.

This pre checklists and pop process and post checklist and process, um, go through it. Deeply, because especially in the post ally, this is the sequence of steps that will save you the most money and broken deal costs. So, sometimes what people do is they sign an ally, and then they get the attorney is the QB everybody working simultaneously and you're paying money when that happens.

So, you can actually do it in an order of steps. You're not paying any money until. Um, you get a little [00:41:00] bit further down the track. So when you go into this post process, um, it's going to tell you, you know, kind of how to work with us and where we can support you, but also what to do 1st. So, the 1st thing is, like, getting your term sheets from lenders.

That doesn't cost you any money to do that. And you can go to a couple of different lenders and see what they're offering. But in order for them to give you a term sheet, they're going to. Go through the financials of the business, and they're going to want to verify those ad backs and they're going to want to do those sorts of things to get a determination of what they would lend to you.

What kind of terms that they would offer you? So that doesn't cost you any money to do that. And you want to do it with a couple. Different people, but there's some, like, watch outs here that you want to just read through this before you do it. Like, don't let them pull your credit. Make sure you don't sign a commitment letter.

They all have different ways that they go through the process and, like, you know, you, you could. [00:42:00] Have them pull in your credit or sign something that you didn't realize, and then you want to make sure that you're not telling them that you're shopping around because that can upset them, especially if they're spending a ton of time with you.

But you'll uncover things like Justin said, like, the determination of the, before you even get to the point where you're spending money on quality of earnings. So, once you get your term sheets, and you decide which 1, you want to go forward with, that's when you can start your, um. Which is, um, you know, go through the diligence process in the list.

There's a ton in there, but in this document, it says prioritizing your diligence and why order matters, right? So, start with lender 1st, then you want to get your financial due diligence 1st so that the thing that can break a deal almost every single time is the finances. So you don't want your lawyers to be spending, like, drawing up any.

Expenses or anything until, you know, that that business is on solid financial footing, because if they [00:43:00] misrepresented the numbers or anything like that, then it's a no go. And then you're going to pay your lawyers to start drafting documents before you even knew that. So, um, read through that document. If y'all have any questions, let me know.

1 of the things we did want to cover in future calls is actually going through this in detail. Like, I just did with the, um. The SBA stuff and we'll do more on SBA in the future. But, um, does that all make sense? Any questions on that? It's like really useful feedback. By the way, Justin, I should have said that before I went on my little rant,

**Justin:** No, no worries. Uh, and I, I wanted to note that Athenas did not Athena and the team did not bring me that deal. Why I got that one locally. Uh, otherwise it probably would have been better a little bit better before I got to me. So that's why. 

**Athena:** Oh, thanks. I appreciate that. Justin's in a like, so New Jersey is like the most wild brokers I've ever seen in my life.

Like they were just a whole different breed over there in New York, New [00:44:00] Jersey. 

**Justin:** The broker that brought me that deal and we went so far and he knew I was, He sent me a deal immediately after I signed the NDA and he never got back to me ever again. So I don't know if he fell off the earth or he, he was just that bad.

I don't know. 

**Athena:** Yeah, he was a wild one, but they like, I definitely like got. I don't know, I just felt like there's some mob adjacent something going on in New Jersey and Ryan and Luke are closer to it now. So I know they still have to interact with that. But, um, that was an enjoyable part of the process of working in Justin's region.

Um, Joe, I've just seen you log on. Do you want to say hello? Do a little, where are you? And, uh, any, any tips or anything that could be useful to other people on their STEEL journey that you've learned so far? Any epiphanies or anything? 

**Joe:** Yeah, maybe. Sorry, I'm late. Uh, just kind of get my feet back under me. I was out of town.

All of last week, and then this week at a [00:45:00] industry conference, so just got back last night and getting unburied from the, uh, daily work. But so that was Justin. If I heard right, it was just last talking good points there. Justin. I'm actually running into that in 1 of the, uh, opportunities that, uh, and, uh, Ryan can see, and I have, I've gone over.

Where I fired back a couple of emails where certain numbers on ad backs on their ad back will exhibits that they created on an Excel sheet. They just weren't at, they weren't making sense and then they dug a little deeper and a little deeper realizing they're double, they were double counting depreciations, even though there was 1 depreciation.

They're putting it on for two years and something as simple as literally adding up trailing 12 month net incomes. They were off by a hundred thousand dollars on the most recent year. I mean, that affects a lot of what your offer is going to be. If it's based on SDE. Um, and of course they have [00:46:00] a certain number in their mind and say, Oh, give us this number and that'll get it done.

Well, that, that just greatly affected what my offer would be. And I haven't even gotten to that full point because they still haven't answered my questions. And it's very appealing. You're really like a deal that I was in over a year ago where I fired some things back to a broker and said, these are not anything around any earnings, income or ad backs.

These, uh, these just don't even fall in this bucket. So don't have a good feeling on that particular deal or the price is going to go down quite a bit. Um, to the other point, kind of in not spending money. And not going too far into due diligence with lawyers and even spending money on quality of things with an accountant is, uh, there was a deal earlier in the year.

I was on my own with it, dealing with the seller, selling and buying broker. It was before URB. And I like the business. It was more like an e commerce, but, you know, tangible sort of product that was in stock. And [00:47:00] by the way, everyone, I live in Tampa. Um, so I was, I was looking very excited going under contract with them.

After I go under contract, I send it to the lender who had a relationship at the time. First thing she does is pull, I don't know if she was able to pull like a credit, but she more or less looked during lawsuits. Against them, and in the past they had one, they still had a current one against them and they just filed for bankruptcy.

So something as simple as looking up legal things before you can get anywhere close to making an offer, that kind of, that'll scare off a lender real quick. And you don't want to waste your emotion time or money. On something like that. 

**Athena:** Yeah, that's one of the like things I love about checking deals with letters is because they they have access to that sort of thing.

They do just like pull it and like flag things with you there. Um, but, you know, I will say, like. Keeping track of financials and multi million dollar businesses when sellers are probably [00:48:00] like, not financial people, financial controllers can be a struggle bus for them, so it's, it's good to do it in this order and like, for you to catch those kinds of things, then also knowing the reassurance of like, everything looks good.

Stereotypes good up to the point. Lender's offered a term sheet that's where the quality of earnings like rebuild the financials and like actually, Verify like every entity account is. It says, so using an actual quality of earnings provider. You know, rather than an accountant who's like, I could do that for you.

We've seen that happen before. And especially if they charge by the hour, Joe, you should watch back the, the last meeting where he was talking about that. Um, like, the, the amount came in at, like, triple what they were expecting, and they didn't have super high confidence in the. The numbers, because it was like, somebody learning how to do it for the 1st time.

So, um, but we're going to bring 1 of our favorite [00:49:00] providers on 1 of these calls and having walked through a report and everything to see, I'll know what should be included in there. No matter who you use and and what's coming, you know, because it's, I think it's 1 of the best things you can spend money on before you.

Close on a deal is just that financial due diligence. 

**Joe:** Yeah, really, and to the point, if they can't answer it quickly and get it corrected, or somehow they're correct and maybe they messed up something, you can also tell if the deal's been on the street for a while, how hasn't it been corrected already.

And the 2nd thing is that there's not getting back to you every day that goes by, you're losing confidence in that deal. So keep score on that. Um, but to answer your other questions here at the, and it's been a while, a number of months since talking and some chaos in the fall. Yeah, I'm trying to get a little bit of a rhythm going.

I'm still working on the industrial packaging company Ryan and I talked about. I mean, the numbers look great, really close to my house. [00:50:00] That particular one that's been on the, uh, kind of out there working with the broker since maybe February. So out on the street, maybe for 10 months. And just for the group, what happened, um, immediately a private equity firm got ahold of it and got it under LOI due diligence.

And at the 11th hour, supposedly backed up because of their own issues and not necessarily on the sellers. Um, and of course, with that, we're probably deeper pockets, faster process. They wanted to do something with the real estate or didn't need the real estate. So their numbers looked a bit different. Um, Because there's also a seller that's looking at right sizing what he would be charging on rent for his warehouse.

And so, of course, it's greatly affecting the rent number and the, you know, discretionary earnings and, you know, having to, um, having to account for, uh, those differences and going forward of a renter, which would be me. Uh, so long story [00:51:00] short is, you know, they, they had a much larger offer than what a private buyer would be able to provide.

I ended up getting that number out of the, um, The broker himself, so I'm still trying to breathe life into that one. I'm looking at some other options, but I'm still kind of on my last offer. I did put in my wife for it. I'm, uh, you know, the other one was maybe. 3. 4 and they're still looking at four over four million.

And does it 

**Athena:** have a forgivable note option in it? Were you here for that part when I was talking through when you can use that? 

**Joe:** On this deal? I don't think so. No. 

**Athena:** No, they didn't have a high year in the past that you could peg to? No. No. 

**Joe:** Um, so that, that one still mulling around with the one I was talking about where their exhibits and, and they're trailing 12 months were.

Greatly off that [00:52:00] that obviously affected what they claimed their SDs were. Um, that's is kind of still out there ongoing, but I don't have faith in that one. Because again, the lack of urgency that they're getting back to the are correcting it. Something doesn't feel right and then Ryan brought an opportunity to me last week, I believe for a window and door company.

It's a little bit of a distance from my house. The numbers look good. I think there's a couple flags just in the way of like a two, a couple married couple to owner sort of swing how to how to handle that on top of I think they wanted to mandate selling the property with it. And that sort of thing, so I have yet to still really dig in to all the numbers that I just kind of read through the sim a little bit and listen to part of the call.

So that one's still ongoing. 

**Athena:** Um, so, uh, great update. So I'm just thinking so for the next session, what I can do is a continuation of SBA and talking about when you can add real estate in and the [00:53:00] different tools that are available on there's real estate in a deal. Would that be a useful conversation for everybody to talk about next time?

**Anke:** I think so. Cool. 

**Athena:** Yeah. Because there's different, different ways to play real estate and actually you can uncap additional SBA money, you can amortize things differently. So it can actually help things significantly depending on the real estate or how you value the real estate. So, um, I was working on a master SBA doc anyway, so we can talk about that next time.

And then. Yeah. Cool. Um, speaking to the, um, lawyers tomorrow about the LOI template, so I should be able to give you all a timeline on when we're going to bring the lawyers on to talk through LOI stuff. And then, um, QV a meeting with next week, so we'll get a date in for them too. But, um, you know, any topics you want to hear, like, drop those in the channel.

If y'all want to connect with each other, like, we'd love it if you in the channel also. Um, and then if you want to bring [00:54:00] any of those deals, like I said, I think it's helpful, even though it's like scary. Like, did I do the modeling right? Like, modeling is one of the more complicated things. Nobody expects you to be an expert, but if you put it together and then we can do it all together, then I can like, live on a deal that we're working on, like, show you all how I might model things and, Um, you know, some of you have actually had me do that with you so you can see, but I think it's beneficial for everybody to learn from it.

So if you have any deals that you've put together the modeling, drop it in that form on the channel. And then we can go over it on the call to, um, any other questions, challenges, topics, things that you guys want to chat about before we sign off for

Cool. It's nice to see all your faces. I love this. So I'm so glad we started this because I'm having fun. Um, so hopefully it'll be useful to you all as we keep going through this to, [00:55:00] um, we're going to save the recording. We'll drop that on the dashboard. So, um. And then we're also going to create, uh, the, the document that I showed you with the SBA stuff, we're going to be creating a master SBA, just cheat sheet for y'all on everything that I'm talking through.

So we'll do that after, uh, next week. Um, but in the meantime, check out the resources on the dashboard, um, revisit the calls last week. We had some good conversations around, you know, speaking to lenders and stuff. Um, and if there's anything you want us to cover in future ones, let us know, like, this is.

Really for you and so we can help support y'all to become business owners quicker. 

**Joe:** Question for you, Thena, what, uh, the link for this meeting and the meeting's recurring at the same time every Tuesday, Thursday, if I heard correct. Right. Um, was there an actual invite on a calendar invite or email that went out?

Or do I just need to, I can copy the link and make my own invite. I just wanna make sure it hits my phone every week. 

**Athena:** Yeah, you were sent a calendar [00:56:00] invite, so, uh, check and see if, if that came through. If not, um. Just send a message and you can make sure you get that, but it should be in everybody's we've sent a calendar invite to everyone.

So it's also on your calendar. So, um, if you didn't see that, just hit on God, she can sort shout. Yeah,

great. Cool. Awesome 

**Ryan:** terms in terms of suggestions for topics to discuss. Um, 1 thing I think is really big is, uh. Building relationships with sellers. And, um, right now, I, I would just say, Justin is a very unique position because he actually speaking to an off market seller. Um, so I would love any opportunity if we kind of dive a little bit more into building those relationships and how maybe it differs from off market to on market.

And, you know, we have someone right now could give a lot of insight on that. [00:57:00] So, um, Justin, if you'd be so kind to maybe discuss that 1 day, that's something I would love to hear. 

**Anke:** Yeah, for 

**Ryan:** sure. 

**Athena:** Cool. Um, we'll check in with you, Justin, and see when you're joining in the future. And maybe we can either do that on Tuesday or Thursday next week.

Because I think there's a couple off market opportunities that folks are going to be working or that are coming down the track.

**Anke:** Cool. 

**Athena:** We'll message you and, um, uh, signal and see when you're available. And then Ryan can, um, Put some thoughts together to just like a learning session for y'all and just best practices and stuff like that. When you're going into seller meetings, um, great suggestion, Ryan.

Amazing well, thank you all for giving us your valuable time and energy and, um, really excited on the deals that you're working on. Um, and as we're here to support you, so let us know if we can help. Otherwise we'll see you next week. Have a great [00:58:00] weekend. Thank you. You too. 

**Anke:** Bye guys. Thank you. 

**Athena:** Bye. Bye.
