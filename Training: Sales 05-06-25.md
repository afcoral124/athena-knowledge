0:00 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Let me tell my speaker. Going well, thanks.

0:02 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  How are you? I'm doing well. I'm doing well. I'm getting a little better at that intro call. think I did a little better.  I did a better job yesterday, and then tried to flow a little better today. I could tell I was toeing that line a little bit in terms of context that I was adding as they were asking questions, completely unintentionally.  But yesterday, had an intro call. My talk rate was 30% or something, more in line with what we're looking for.  So I'm finding that balance slowly, but surely, swallowing quotation marks. I think that's the fifth intro call I've ran.  So, yeah, heading in the right direction is the moral of that story.

0:48 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Great. Yeah, I spent 35 minutes recording a video for you today that didn't pick up my voice. So we're going to have to do it live today.

0:58 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, no problem.

1:00 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Um, how did M&A Launchpad go?

1:03 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  It was all right. It's just like, I met a bunch of like, I followed up with all my leads today.  I think I got, I hit my 20 goal in terms of like conversations, people scanning my card, but in terms of like, what I brought home with me, like, maybe seven or eight, you know what I mean?  One, one I'm really excited about. She reached out to me yesterday to set up a call, but it's like, they'll love you.  But it's like, her and two of her friends that worked together previously in data science, and they're like, running a search with all of them.  So they're going to pool capital and go out and buy something. She was like, yeah, we've been at it for a while.  We've really been struggling to find deal flow. Like we kind of set up like different channels and was taken like more of a divide and conquer standpoint.  And just like weren't seeing results. So she was like, really excited about our conversation and then like reached out So I got a call with.  On Thursday, I met a really good channel partner that's doing like QAV, but he was like, yeah, we've got like a lot of our clients are having a hard time finding deal flow and they're like reaching out to us to help us find that.  We just don't do that. So I sent him a text message. He texted me last night and then I sent him my link this morning to get on the calendar.  So a couple of good service providers, but like, go ahead. Who was it? A guy named Alosh. They're like brand new.  And I can tell you, I didn't even get the name of his company, to be honest. They didn't have a booth or anything there.

2:33 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay. Just be careful like about offering cross referrals.

2:38 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  Oh, I didn't offer that at all. Just because like I, the conversation that I had with him, I didn't feel confident like even bringing that up.

2:47 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So a one-sided relationship for sure. Great. I used to, we're going to have to look at the referral amount, but.  So, like, I basically tell people, like, we pay referral fees, we pay some when their search starts, so it'll be, like, after the onboarding period, and then we pay the majority of it when somebody closes on a business.

3:17 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  Cool. Yeah, I think he was really just looking for support for his clients, Athena. Like, I don't think he's necessarily, like, overly concerned about the referral fee component, but he was just, like, I told him what I did, and he's like, oh, man, like, we've been looking for somebody like you to, like, help, like, our clients find good fit businesses.  So that's another one I'm hopeful on. Commercial real estate guy, but, like, is at the very beginning of his search.  I met a couple guys in IT. One was searching for, like, two years and hasn't found anything, you know, and it's, like, based on my conversation, he wasn't super serious.  Somebody else, like, looking to go pay cash. Passion build a portfolio of SaaS businesses, has like a TaskRabbit competitor, and I'm like, I don't agree with your approach, but that's not for me to say, you know?  So like, it was interesting, but like, you know, from last year, it was like, it's not set up great from a networking perspective, but I got the chance to meet with Crystal while I was there.

4:21 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  She was singing your phrases. Oh, that's sweet.

4:24 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  Right. And then she's like, she did the women in M&A fireside, you know, and she was like, I was like, I was gonna go to your fireside chat, but I was a little apprehensive.  She's like, no, please come. Like, it'll, it's like, she's like, it'll tell you about the secret weapon you didn't know you needed.  I was like, I'm an aspiring searcher myself, and like, my wife wants to be involved. So I ended up like catching her fireside chat as well.  But yeah, she was real kind. And then I dropped the ball on Arvin, Athena, transparently. I'm like, I figured I would have ran into him.  But I sent him a text on Monday was like, Hey, man, did you make. Make it home safe. I'm surprised we didn't run into each other.  I was like, do you meet some capital connections? And he was like, yeah. like, hey, man, I look forward to like recapping the event and catching up on Thursday.  So I think we're cool there.

5:10 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah.

5:12 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  Go ahead.

5:13 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  No, no, no. I said, yeah. What was it?

5:17 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  Yeah. Yeah, it was good overall. The biggest thing that was funny to see, you'll enjoy this, because I remember, what's his name?  The older gentleman that works with those equity launchpad guys, he was like, last year, was like, yeah, go out, find a deal.  Like, as long as the structure is right, you'll find a bank to fund it, right? I remember him very specifically saying that.  And then like this year, they're like, the market's really crowded, like talking about ways to get through like broker conversations, like the tone of that conference from like just a year ago was like, so vastly different.  And that was like the thing that I thought was most interesting.

5:58 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Hmm. Yeah. Nobody's really learning how to speak broker, you know? And they're the ones with the majority of the deals, if we're completely honest, right?  Like, so, yeah. And then brokers are just like, what the  is this all nonsense? Like, you know, just like not responding to people or not able to respond.  So it's, it's wild. Yeah. So it didn't seem like great quality searchers again. I kind of picked that up from last year.

6:35 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  Yeah. I'm like, I should have listened to you initially and saved my Saturday, but it's okay.

6:40 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  I mean, it's probably really good practice to just do the elevator pitch and then talk about what we do and that sort of thing in a room where it's like, it's not catastrophic if whatever.  I remember there was one woman last year. I don't know if this is a cultural thing, but it's it's But since And it's important to they still don't have a know  And I asked my TA, because I had a TA when I was at UT, and she's Indian, and I was like, what's with this grilling you on your credentials thing?  Because it happens almost every time, right? And this woman had me almost up against a wall at the Launchpad event last year, grilling me on what made me credentialed to do what I do.  And it was just, like, really weird. And yeah, she had some interesting thoughts and perspective on that. But she's like, that's normal.  And I was like, God, it's like, what the ?

7:47 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  I met one of Matthias' connections there as well. One of his business development directors was out there, Andres, I think.

7:55 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Oh, right, okay.

7:57 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  So I got to meet him. That was cool. That was Yeah, and my elevator pitch, the question I kept being asked was like, oh, so you pair searchers with funding?  And I was like, no, think of us as a matchmaker, but instead of finding your perfect mate, we find your perfect business.  I'm like, oh, so you help source deal flow. Yeah, that's exactly what we do. And I got the price question a bunch, so I got a little better about skirting around that and not directly answering that question.  So, no, it was definitely helpful to get reps in. I enjoyed it, for sure, but it wasn't great from a quality perspective.  like I said, there's a couple opportunities that came out of it. And I've got, honestly, the networking event on Thursday was better than the event on Saturday, which I thought was weird.  I'm sad that you were connected with the gentleman that was running the one on Friday, because I was like, oh, man, I would have cleaned up there.

8:54 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  But yeah, yeah, that's not really like, do you know who Clint is?

9:00 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  And what he's doing. I did a dive on his website, and it looks like they're mainly monetizing on the buy side as opposed to the sell side.

9:08 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay, so Clint is Clint Fiore. He's probably one of the best known and most respected brokers by the search community.  And he's a business broker, has been a business broker for, I think, nearly a decade.

9:23 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  He and I were both facilitators in Cody's community.

9:26 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  We both stepped away from it. And share thoughts on that. He's super active on social media. So if you haven't followed him, you should because he's got really amazing content.  But he speaks at all the broker conventions. He speaks at all the searcher conventions. He's got a foot in both.  Him and Jackie Hirsch are kind of the two best known, really. Clint is very buyer-centric. You know, so he's like, I'm getting paid by the buyer, even though my client's a seller, you know, and he brings that perspective.  To the broker conferences and I'm like, it's good. He raised a lot of money to start dealonomy, which is essentially like going to be buyer focused, but like bringing deals to market and then charging the buyer for them.  And they're going to like walk the buyer through the process too.

10:24 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  So it's not directly competitive, but it is.

10:29 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  And we haven't found a way to work together. So I think it would be hugely inappropriate for my salesperson to go to his event.

10:37 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  I agree. I agree. I think I met Jackie last year.

10:40 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  She's based in Orlando. Yeah. She was at M&A LaunchPod.

10:44 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  I doubt she came this year. Yeah. I didn't see her there this year. She was really nice though. She knew because the sell side firm that I was working at was based out of Orlando.  So we knew a bunch of the same people, but yeah, she was like really nice and a wealth of knowledge.  Like I enjoyed my conversation with her last year.

11:00 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  He's awesome. We work great with brokers, right? And Jackie name-checked me at the SM. She was one of the speakers at SMBash.  And she was talking about having your buyer profile together. And she's like, Athena's people? She's like, I know what color underwear they're wearing.

11:16 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  They do a really good job.

11:17 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  was like, thank you, Jackie. So she likes what we're doing because we help, you know, like with having a pre-qualified somebody that's like serious, that has support through the process, they can take them more seriously.  So it's not that we don't work really well with brokers, but with what Clint's building specifically, we haven't found a way to like, how do we make the fees work?  If you are also charging the buyers, we're charging the buyers, you're not charging the sellers.

11:43 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  So we just haven't sat down and like put it together yet.

11:48 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  And given this SOP change, I am curious how that will, like, I don't know what his fee is or how that will impact things.  But yeah, this community is really smart. We're really respectful. So I just need to make sure, especially if we're speaking to other service providers, vendors, lenders, that sort of thing, that I probably already have a relationship with them in some way.

12:11 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  So we just manage that.

12:14 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  But yeah, I think it's good practice to just get out there and talk to people. And like I said, it's like, it was an S and bash where you really need to have your talking points on point and people and that sort of thing.  So all good. Okay, cool. Any immediate questions or can I run through the intro meeting with you?

12:37 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  Just hit me with my objection for the day.

12:40 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah. What's your close rate, Austin?

12:44 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  Great question. Just curiously, what does close rate tell you in your view, Athena?

12:49 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Well, like how successful you are in getting people businesses?

12:54 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, yeah. Well, let me ask this. How many people do you know right now that are actually searching for a business?  Or active. We were searching for a business.

13:02 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Gosh, hundreds?

13:04 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  So a bunch then. Of those, what percentage would you say have actually closed on an opportunity?

13:14 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Well, I know people after they close. So the people I listen to on Acquiring Wines or the people I hear speaking at events.

13:23 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, that makes sense. But, I mean, would you agree that even if the perfect deal won't close, even if the buyer is ready?  Or if the buyer isn't ready to kind of move forward and feels confident moving into business ownership? Too many words.

13:41 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  I don't know. I mean, they just need the right business.

13:45 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, 100%. So what the statistics are in the industry is, like, of the people that say they want to go out and buy a business, only 2% actually do.  So the biggest risk to close is actually on the buyer's side. Like, what do you think the real? Value in leveraging a search and match for a minute.

14:06 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  I guess, you know, deal flow.

14:09 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  Right. So getting qualified deals in front of you, right? And we're proud to say 100% of the clients that have signed up and moved forward with us have gotten to a point where LOI has been signed and accepted.  And as you know, a variety of things can happen in the due diligence process outside of your control as well as ours.  Right. So we measure ourselves on letters of intent and actually bring you good fit opportunities that meet your specific buy box.  Does that make sense?

14:38 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah.

14:40 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  Perfect. So that was kind of my thought in terms of how to overcome that. I don't know your thought process there.

14:45 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  I love it. I think you skipped one question, though.

14:50 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  I love that.

14:51 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Tell me. So you said, like, who do you know that's closed on the business? And I was like, people I've listened to on a podcast and on stage at an event.  But like, okay, but like of the people you know personally, how many of them like have closed on a business?  Thank Thank you.

16:03 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  I guarantee you is that we're going to put businesses that fit your deal box in front of you that do have the potential to be something to buy.  Cool. Yeah, that's an easy flip. Perfect. I'm excited for the next time I hear it.

16:18 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  I like where you went with that, though, like getting to think about like, do you know anyone personally, you know, do you know anyone personally that's like maybe going about this the wrong way?  Like, what are they doing? So would you measure us on whether we're able to control that person from being who they are and doing what they're going to do?

16:40 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  Right. That's the idea.

16:42 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah. But that's where I do say I can guarantee you that I'm going to put businesses in front of you that match your deal box.

16:51 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  And skill set.

16:52 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, like it would be businesses you could buy, but what you do from there on, even if I give you the best advice.  Like, you don't want to be controlled, right? I can't make you do anything, right?

17:06 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  Right. Cool. Yeah, I'm like, that's helpful. I'm like, I was just like, thinking through that a little bit. I leveraged Shack GPT to give me some ideas and then just like, kind of put my own spin on it.

17:17 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So I think we're getting closer on that one. Another thing, I don't know if I told you when people ask your price, or how much it costs, something that always seems to like, stop them from asking anymore is if I'm like, oh, we're like a bespoke concierge service, so it's going to be different depending on your search.  But we, you know, do an upfront fee to cover the search costs. And so my team's paid. And then there's, you know, it's like an overall flat fee.  So some of it's an advance retainer, and then some of it's do it close. And they're like, oh, okay, you know, and then it, they don't really dig from there when I just like, pivot into what the model is.  I also like, before I have an answer, I'm like, well, we're like a bespoke search. So I need to understand your search a little bit better.  But what I can tell you is we're flat fee. There's an advanced retainer so that you've got skin in the game and my teams are covered.  And then there's an amount at close. But typically, it's going to work for people that are looking at businesses north of $2 million in enterprise value.

18:20 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  Yeah. Perfect.

18:22 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Perfect. Great. Oh, my gosh. Gamora came in and sat. She knows how to, did I tell you, she knows how to, like, bulldoze my door.  Cole's dog is figured out because it's not anything but, like, a latch. It's, like, just one of those, like, ball things where you, like, push it.  And she just, like, slams through the door now to open the door. Cool. Okay. I'm going to pull up the intro meeting and I'm going to explain why these things are here and in what order and what I'm looking to get from each of these questions.

18:57 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  I actually added some stuff back in that used to be in there. That I think would be really useful for you.

19:03 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  And then you know when to pull those in and when to pull them out based on doing a number of these things.  So I thought we could record it. And then that way we can also have like a training video for future if we needed to.

19:15 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  How's that sound? Yeah, that sounds perfect. And just a heads up, Athena, I have an exploration call at the top of the hour.

19:22 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  I have Buyer's Club. It's every Tuesday and Thursday. So yeah, I'll need to end five minutes before so I can just get my head right.
  SCREEN SHARING: Athena started screen sharing - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/292841225?timestamp=1173.228763  So let me pull this up. Okay. Cool.

19:40 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  Can you see this?

19:41 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, I see you. Awesome. So this, I think you need to be a little bit more like on your experience a little bit more.

19:54 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  The whole point of this is to establish your credibility and authority.

19:58 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So, you know, my introduction. In the capital markets was kind of like, I just got started. I'm one of you.  And I would be like, no, I worked in an early stage accelerator where I helped hundreds of startups or whatever the number is, right?  And then what did you do in sell side too? Like I helped facilitate X number, X number of million dollars worth of transactions or something, you know, like just the point of this part is they don't know who you are.  Establish your credibility. So they realize they're getting on the phone with somebody that like knows their . And then also just, I stopped doing this because they watched a video of me establishing my credibility before they got on the call.  And if they confirmed they watched the video, then I was like, you know me, I'm the founder, right? And we've helped, you know.  So this line here is we help first-time buyers acquire and find businesses. Our combined experience has saw us about thousands of deals worth hundreds of millions of dollars and support hundreds of people through their  Acquisition journey, or our team has gotten 100% of clients and designed LOI. Just something to just remind them of the credibility up front.  And I don't even give space to breathe before I go into this. So the purpose of this call is to see if you qualify to work with us.  Not everyone does. It's based on three factors. This is your career experience and background. How much do I think that they're going to be a good leader?  Their overall acquisition goals, and this is for me to understand whether their goals align with what we can help them achieve.  And then like we had to close, like do they have money? Do they have what it takes to actually close?  Today, I'm going to ask you if you're going to be a fit. The really important part about this section here is that they feel like they're going to get value no matter what.  So I'm vetting them, but also like, A, I'm not going to discuss pricing with you. And B, I'm going to leave you in a good place.  So if you're a good fit and we can. At the end of this call, invite you to a second call.  You've done this part, which is fine. If you're not a good fit, want you to say this whole thing.

22:10 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  I may give you some homework or refer you out depending on where you're at.

22:13 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So if they're not ready, then assigning them one of our webinars or to go read, buy, then build, or watch Acquiring Minds episode or something, or refer them out if they're not right for us.  So if they've bought businesses before and they have exceptional experience and they have a specific industry in mind, then I might make an introduction to Dave or Andre.  But then it just removes the, like, I'm not selling them anything. And also, like, if they're not a good fit, it's kind of like, no pressure.  Like, if you're not a good fit, I'll give you some stuff. But like, you know, almost in a sense, taking it away.  I also always like, this sound good. It's like, I'm getting that. Yes. That okay with you. I'm getting that.  Yes, like I'm getting those yet. So I don't just tell them that and then go into the next thing.  I stop and be like, does that all sound good to you? Is that okay with you? Cool. So that all makes sense so far?  Yes, ma'am. Okay. Then this is me trying to figure out how much they know about us. Oftentimes what they'll do is they'll start going into their buy box immediately.  So I'll have to redirect and ask them again. So like, they'll be like, well, I'm looking for la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la.  Okay, cool. And what about our service appealed to you? Or what's not happening right now that had you reaching out to us?  So I'll redirect until I get some sort of an answer in terms of what appealed to them about our service.  And this is me trying to gauge how much they know about what we do. Because like that guy air-voned, like he thought we...  We did finance matchmaking, you know, like he didn't even know we did deal sourcing. So I'm trying to like uncover that early on to really to figure out how much education I'm going to have to do.  Because I assume that everybody knows what a buy side search and match acquisition matchmaker does, but nobody does, you know, and a lot of times they'll fill out that form without reading anything.  They'll just see me commenting in a group or they'll see something somewhere and they'll just fill it out without actually reading it.  So I never make the assumption that they know. So I'll just keep asking a few questions to try to dig that out.  Usually they'll tell us this in the form. So something that I've noticed is that people get really irritated if I ask them questions that they've already answered.  So if I'm, if they're like, heard you on a podcast and I'd be like, so I saw you heard about us on a podcast.  Was that Renan's episode? So I'll just acknowledge that I already know that they filled that out. And it's the same thing with this question before.  Also, they put that in the form. They won't get routed to a call unless they say no on that.  So asking it is just like, well, did you read my form? I noticed that it kind of breaks the trust early on if they feel like they already gave us that information and we're not saying like, so you can skip this if you already know the answer to that.  Or you could say like, so I saw you haven't bought a business before. Do you have any experience in M&A at all?  You know, like, some of them will have like, oh, I did this and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. And then this whole line is really important.  So what I'm trying to get here, I'm starting to get them to set their vision. And this is not for me to like dive in and give them any coaching at this point.  actually, I removed the little coaching point earlier because we got in the weeds with Erevan when actually the whole point of this section is to get them plugging in their GPS and like  Painting us the picture of their vision so that when I go through the rest of the process, I'm going from like the pain that they're in and I'm creating a bridge over to what their vision is.

26:11 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  And I'm helping them see the disconnect between the two places.

26:15 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So this is really about setting the vision. So why do you want to buy a business? What's your end goal?  Oftentimes they'll go back into their deal box. Right. And I don't I don't like really comment or anything at this point.  I'm like, OK, cool. So if they go into the deal box, then they're trying to impress me or they're money motivated.  So then I get into what's the monetary goal. And they'll say my SDE range is 500 to 750. OK, cool.  Well, we actually look at businesses a little bit differently. So what actual money do you want to hit your bank account?  This is the number that we need. This is how we determine like and evaluate every opportunity. Right. So we need to know what.  Minimum amount of money to hit their bank account is after debt service, after reinvestment, after all the bill payments, how much did they want to be making?  Or when they say, like, you know, hey, what's your monetary goal with this acquisition? And they'll be like, oh, SDE, blah, blah, blah.  Cool. You seem like you've thought about the number before. Can I ask why that number? And then they'll be like, oh, well, I figured this much for loan payments.  You know, so as long as you're getting to, like, cash in the bank account, that's what's important. And we need to understand what the floor is and what the ideal is.  So, you know, if they're in full time work, I want to know how much they're making out and how much it's going to take them to, like, put in their two weeks notice of the W-2.  So, OK, you said you want 200 in your bank account. Is that what you're making right now? Is that the amount to replace your income?  Is that your... Goal is to leave your W-2 and be able to live off about that. So is that enough to actually be able to put in your two weeks notice right now?  And a lot of times they'll be like, well, with my bonuses and with everything else, it's probably more like $250, $300.  So the bank's going to look at what their current living situation is and what their bills are and what they're currently making.  And then we need to see if there's a big disconnect between what they're saying they can live off of what they're making now.  And also if they're just being realistic or they've set their standards really low. So if it's feeling really low, it's like, okay, is that what you're settling for because you're being realistic or you've struggled to find some things or is that what you really want?  Because when you work with us, you get to wave a magic wand and we can look at businesses that you want.  And most of them will be like, well, I'd be okay with that for like the first year or two, but there needs to be some growth.  Or if I was hitting 300, then that would It would be like ideal, right? Or if you already know that there's a spouse in the mix, like a lot of men in particular want to give their wife the option to work or not, you know, like they're like, she loves her job and everything, but I'd love for her to have the option if she didn't want to.  It's like, okay, well, how much is that? Right? So we're setting goals and visions in this section. And then this is a really important one that for money motivated people, we still need to have this understanding of like what the non-monetary goals are.  There's a reason why they want to earn their money this way than other ways. And we need to understand what that is.  What are their personal motivations and drivers? And like what I say, you know, it's, it's a version of this line.  I'm like, look, we do things different than everybody else. None of the team are motivated by money. We're motivated by the life that we're going to be able to give you by offering you a business, or we're motivated by the goals we're going to help you achieve, or we're motivated by helping you design life on your own terms and having that autonomy, or being able to build whatever life that you want.  So when you think about that, what is it for you? What comes up for you? What are the non-monetary?  What are your personal goals that buying a business would allow you to achieve? And if they're not giving you some real stuff, don't leave this until you get the answers, because the rest of this falls down if you don't get them thinking about what life is going to be like as a business owner.

30:43 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  I had, let me ask a question maybe here, Athena. had one today with Federico, and he was asking me, or like the reason he gave me is like, I want to like learn more skills.  And then like, what I fed back to him was like, yeah, like, so it sounds like, like. Your goal is really to reach your full potential, and what you're doing right now isn't challenging you.  Am I understanding that correctly? And he was like, yeah. Talking about I'm a lifelong student, and I really strive to push myself in everything that I do, and I've kind of hit a plateau in real estate where I think business buying would allow me something else to sink my teeth into.  Would you have gone deeper into that and asked additional questions? And then if so, what would those questions look like?

31:33 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, as long as it's not about money, right? So a lot of people are feeling held back from their true potential.  They feel like they have something in them that they haven't been able to give the world. Like with Morgan, his mission is to help people and create a work environment that he didn't get, where he was able to value his employees.  Everybody's going to be a little different. Most of them are like, I don't want to ask permission. To take my kid to their recital.  I don't want to ask permission. I don't want to earn somebody else money. I don't want to put in all this time and work and have somebody else get the upside.  I want freedom over my life. I want to feel meaning. I want to feel purpose. I want to feel like I'm achieving my potential.  I have this unproven thesis that I want to prove to myself and everybody else. So there's another reason beyond money.  Like if you want passive, if you just want money, then I would be like, okay, if they're just like, oh, you know, I just, I want a return on my investment.  it's like, well, this is not a passive thing. So why not choose stock markets? Why not invest in real estate?  Why not invest in a searcher versus buying your own business where you're to have to be active? Right. And then it just might be a huge disconnect between what they think this asset class is and what they want out of it.  You know, so I'm looking for people that have a point to prove, whether it's having autonomy. Their own life, whether it's proving out that they could be a boss, whether it's, you know, there's something that buying a business is going to allow them to achieve in their life that they aren't currently having.  And until we get them to like say that out loud, then it's really hard to dig into the rest of it because we have to pull back to that.  Right. And it's like, now we have examples that we're helping them. Like you want to be able to take your kids to your recital, you know, and currently at your job, you're not going to be able to do that.  So, um, I don't get into coaching here. I just let them talk. And if I don't feel like I'm getting good answers, then I'll just ask more questions to get to what I'm trying to get to.  What I'm trying to get is for them to just have that, like, you'll see it that moment when they start clicking into like some sort of emotion, you know, whether it's passion for something, whether it's a mission, whether it's the anger against the current situation that they're in.  And we need to get. And the understanding of what the emotional drivers are behind buying a business. So then I pivot into when did you start your search?  So like now, like, and I'm going to ask this in a multitude of different ways, which I'll explain why it's in here.  So when did you start your search? Like, when did you actively start looking? It's like, okay, well, how long have you actually been doing this seriously?  Okay, now let's get into specifics. How do you plan on financing? What I'm looking for here is how much knowledge they have about the financing process.  And I'm also weeding out anybody that has unrealistic seller note expectations. Like, do they have money? Do they understand a little bit about the financing process?  Or are they like, well, I need investors to make up the money, you know, like, like he's going after deals, he can't get financed, you know, like, or Yeah.  They to Or You And when Renan's episode went live, was 100% seller financing. And he mentioned my name. I was like, if people think I'm going to help them with 100% seller financing, they are so wrong, right?  Like, I don't believe in it. I don't believe in someone risking their retirement on somebody that is not willing to put in a PG themselves or put in their own money.  Like, that's a really  up thing to do to ask someone to hand over their retirement to you when you're not willing to do anything to the same.  So that's how I personally feel about 100% seller financing, unless there's a situation where it's not financeable by the bank, and somebody has a track record to not put that person's whole livelihood at risk.  But I have that in so that I make sure that like, if somebody hears about us from Renan, they're not coming with unrealistic expectations that we can help people that have no money to invest.  Then how much do you have available to invest in the business? And then they'll be like, oh, like 300.  I'm like, okay. Is that all cash? Is it an investment? Where does it come from? If they're like, well, no, that's cash.  That's liquid. Okay, cool. What do you have? Do you have any home equity? Do you have any retirement accounts?  You want to make sure you fully understand the financial picture before moving on. And if they start getting weird about you asking, just be like, hey, I'm not going to ask you to put all of your money into this deal, but it does help me understand your buying power because the banks are going to look at all of your assets, right?  So that kind of quells the, why are you asking me all these questions? Or are you going to try to push me to use all of it?  Be like, I'm not necessarily going to push you. I just like to know what tools are in the financial toolkit and what your buying power looks like.  So it helps me if I know your full kind of financial situation. So do you have any equity in homes?  Do you have any retirement accounts? If you have retirement accounts, do you have 401ks? Or are you The IRAs, right?  And then just be like, this really helps us when we get to the structuring parts so we can tell you what your options are if you did end up, you know, wanting to go after a deal bigger or that would need more capital than what you're saying you're willing to invest right now.

37:15 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  That's so much better than the answer I gave earlier today, Athena.

37:22 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  That's why I wanted to go through this because I'm like, there's a method of the madness in these questions and everything.  So they're like, oh, you're trying to help me and just be like, I'm not expecting you to want to put it anymore.  But the banks look at your full picture. So that just helps me understand what I could, you know, give you guidance on in terms of what you can afford based on your risk tolerance and based on your comfort level.  Right. And then they're like, oh, OK. And then they'll loosen up and they'll tell you a little bit more.  So they're either like, why the  are you asking or are you going to ask me to spend all my money?  So you cover that off with one statement and then they're good. But it. It does genuinely help. Like, if they only have 200 in cash and they have no home equity, they have no retirement accounts, and guess what?  We're going to have to, like, probably include some post-closed liquidity within that 200. You know what I'm saying?

38:14 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  That was the justification. I used to ask that question. was like, hey, like, look, like, it sounds like you have 200K to invest, but, like, how familiar are you with post-closed liquidity?  Have you, like, dove into that in any of the webinars with Live Oak? And I was like, yeah, a little bit.  I'm like, that's one of the things that I look at when evaluating risk for transactions. Like, what else do you have, like, from that standpoint?  And I didn't get good data because of how I worded that, for sure. Yeah. So that was really helpful.

38:45 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  It took me a while to, like, nail that one. That's why I wanted to talk through this, because, like, there's stuff in my head that's not necessarily in these questions or context in terms of what I'm trying to get from asking these questions.  Um, so So Then on the location, this one's really important, right? Because like either they can't go anywhere and they need to be just managed expectations.  Like, hey, if you don't want to go more than 45 minutes from your house, like it's not that it's impossible.  It's just going to take you a lot longer than people that are open to the whole of the US.  You know, search funds, they raise money to go out and search for two years with a funded team behind them.  And they have to be open to the whole of the US when they do it. You know, so it's just like, so you're telling me you want to go 45 minutes from your house.  It's not that it's impossible. You just need to extend your timeline. Um, and so knowing that, are you okay with it taking, you know, possibly a couple of years, uh, like without us, but at least at least a year with us, if you're super geo restricted and they're like, and it's like, well, how far are you?  Well, are you going willing to go from your location, like how long of a commute? If it's a short distance, I would just talk about like either extending the timeline or be like, hey, one of the benefits of working with someone like us is you get to wave that magic wand.  Is there any places you've ever thought of relocating to that if you found the perfect business, you'd be open to?  Um, or are there any circumstances that you would be willing to relocate for a short amount of time or, you know, do some like hybrid situation?  So if they're super tight on geo and they're in a very tiny market, then you just need to tell them like, I am going to have to have a chat with a team to see if we'd have enough deal flow that we'd feel good about taking it on as a client.  Cause there's a certain amount of deals that we want to see and we do a look back when we start with you and we'll be able to tell you what parameters can increase your deal flow, but with a small geo, you're probably.  Going to be looking on the small end of the deal flow spectrum. And notice at this point, I haven't told them how many deals that they get at all, right?  Cool. Any questions on the location? No, that's helpful. Great. Okay. This one, I say this all in one mouthful because most of the time, if they're coming to us, they don't know what industries that they want.  So I'll be like, okay, are there any specific industries that you're interested in? Or if it's easier, are there specific industries that you're avoiding?  Almost all of them are like hospitality, retail franchises. like, okay, cool. And if they're like a little weird about the question, I'm like, look, with us, we like it when you're open because that gives us a lot more deal flow to work with.  And we're going to be customizing or we're going to be, you know, looking for businesses that fit you specifically.  But we need to know your nose. So like, for example, I had a client who his family business growing.  was in septic and he was like absolutely nothing in waste given like childhood trauma. So I just need to know what your nose are.  And if you don't have that many, that's great because it gives us a whole lot of potential deals to look at.  But if they're like, I want to be in Austin and I only want to look at fireplace repair, then I'd be like, okay, we're not going to be able to help.  And I might cut the call short or just skip or spend some time on that. If they're super specific on industry, then I'd be like, okay, is that how you actually feel?  Or if you had a team that was doing the search for you and it wasn't wasted time for you, would you be open to other industries if they had other characteristics that would be of interest to you?  Or if we felt like they were a really good skill set match for you? Most people are like, yes.  So that's what we need to understand is like sometimes they're being specific about industry because that's just how they're running their search and it's helping.  And a lot of the stuff out there on the internet is telling people to be really specific. So remember, they're thinking they're being vetted during this whole call.  So they might be giving you answers based on thinking if they answer wrong, they won't qualify to work with us.

43:17 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, yeah, that makes sense.

43:19 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Cool. Oh, weird. Do you plan on being the operator? You know why I ask this. So do you have experience running a business or working in a small business?  This is really important because I want to know if they have exposure to what a small business is like, not only to operate one, but when evaluating one.  And if they've never seen inside a small business before, I can guarantee you they are eliminating businesses. Even if they're like, oh, I've managed a team or I've managed a blah, blah in my company or been involved in M&A transactions.  It's like, okay, cool. I'm going to have to unlearn yet some things. You know, because small business land, it's very different from corporate land.  So I'm going to guess you're eliminating things that you think are red flags based on your best practices, but that are actually like normal and small businesses.  Um, so that's, that's what I'm trying to get to here is like, A, are you going to be like in for massive shock when you get into small business and realize there's no HR department?  And if one of your team go off on vacation, you're the one that covers their work. You know, I only want a couple of employees.  Guess who gets to cover the work during vacation? Still me, you know, like you go on vacation, I cover your work, you know, like, so people don't really realize.  Um, or the books don't look a certain way or, you know, just there's not structures and that sort of thing.  So they're probably evaluating businesses from their lens of what they think is right from their personal experience, not from.  The exposure. So if somebody had like worked in their parents' business growing up, or if they started a business, like that is music to my ears because they at least have some exposure understanding.  Or if they were a consultant, or they do real estate investing, real estate isn't even passive, you know. So time to dedicate to the search.  I want them to be employed. I really do. So if they're a full-time searcher, if they're like, I have 40 hours a week, then I might have a conversation with them at this point and be like, okay, so working with someone like us, it's going to be quality over quantity.  So you're not going to be sifting through listings. You're going to be looking at deals that are a bit further along, but that makes me a little nervous.  Or I might do it on the next call if you go through all this and you feel good. But I need them to be able to at least make five to ten hours a week.

45:56 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  That's helpful. I have that exact situation on my next call. The same thing I was thinking was like, how do I approach this conversation?

46:03 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So that's helpful. Yeah. And like if they're a full-time searcher, I might go through this whole thing and I'll just be honest at the end.  They'll be like, look, I think you have everything we look for. I would just be concerned that you will be impatient due to the amount of time that you have available and the fact you're watching your bank account dwindle down as the search process goes on.

46:28 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  what, uh, there's a question that I was going to ask you. How do we feel about them searching in tandem with us searching?  Like we're stepping on each other's toes, correct?

46:40 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  I don't, I don't want them to do it. So, um, that's, that's the thing with full-time searchers is like, cause they have so much time.  I'm like, I will assign you homework. You can come to the buyer's clubs. I'm going to want you doing financial modeling, brushing up on your negotiation, figuring out structuring.  And working on things that are further along. I'm going to give you homework to do. But I don't need you.  And then they're like, oh, I've already got brokers covered. it's like, okay, well, then we're not a good fit.  If you think you've got it all covered, you know, like, we're going to do on and off market, we're not just going to do off market, we have a process for how we like, review and evaluate deals that you're probably missing.  But that being said, like, if they're on lists, or they put things out there, then we always say, like, if you see something, send you can send it to the team, and the team will put it through their normal vetting process.  on or off market. And I recommend that they do that, because that's the way that you get your money added in to your equity injection is having us work a deal.  If they do it in tandem, guess what, they can't add our fee into the loan if they work the deal outside of working with us.

47:46 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  So it's to their benefit, if they're going to spend the money with us to have us do our job and like pass over an opportunity to us.

47:56 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay, cool. So I was about to search. Yeah. Um, then this current situation, um, is getting them to touch base with what's making them unhappy right now.  Okay, cool. What's your current work situation? Are you doing any side hustles? Do you have any other investments? What do you enjoy about where you're working right now?  And they'll be like, you know, is there anything you dislike? And then they'll have a lot to say. Be like, man, that sounds rough.  Well, like what made you realize this is the right time to start doing this? Like, was there a tipping point or something?  Like there was a moment that they were like, I have to start  doing this. And it was probably an emotional one.  Probably they like were told that they couldn't take their kid to the recital, you know? So it's different from when the search started.  Like that's a timeline thing for us to get an idea. But this was like, what, what did something happen?  Was there a tipping point? Like what made you decide? Like now is the time to start buying a business?  And Then you'll get like, so we're trying to stir up the pain, right? Like you're in work, you're working for someone else.  You're not happy. You've been looking, something happened. Okay, well, let's talk about your search a little bit more. Like, how's it going?  And then they'll be like, you know, they probably launched into it at the beginning, but now you need to come back to it.  Okay. What specifically have you done to buy a business? And they'll be like, well, look at this insights. Okay, cool.  I'm just going to get an understanding of your experience real quick. So I'm just going to rattle through some questions.  I just need some numbers, say for the, like, if they've been doing six months of searching, then I'd be like, okay, so like in the last 90 days, just tell me the number off the top of your head.  Don't necessarily need an explanation. It just gives me an idea of the volume of what you've been doing. How many listings would you say you've looked at?  So you haven't signed the NDAs, just scrolling the listings, you know, and they'll be like, I don't know. A hundred?  Like, cool. Our team's looking at like tens of thousands a month. Okay. How many NDAs have you signed? And they'll be like, ah, blah, blah, blah.  And it's like, okay, of those NDAs, how many did you receive SIMs back for? And there's typically a disconnect here because people will sign NDAs and the brokers never sent the SIMs.  So there's usually a big drop-off point, which is like, that's one point of like, you're not looking at a lot enough.  We're looking at tens of thousands. You're signing NDAs, but you're not getting back the SIMs. Okay. Of those SIMs that you got back, how many of those turned into the next step?  How many of those did you schedule a broker conversation with? Many people won't even have followed up or done that.  So they're eliminating businesses based on a SIM without a broker conversation. Oh, that's interesting. Actually, there's a lot of hidden gems that you typically miss if you're not moving that forward to a conversation because brokers aren't very good marketers.  Okay. So after you. You spoke to the broker. How many sellers have you actually spoken to? How many sellers of businesses?  This is a different question, right? More often than not, it is very few. So they haven't had meaningful reps.  Maybe they've spoken to one or two owners, right? It's not enough experience to be able to know how to handle these conversations when they're buying a business.  And then they're like, so some people that are like getting in a bunch of volume, you know, at this point they're like, oh, I've spoken to like 10, blah, blah, blah.  Okay, cool. How many of those fit your criteria? And then they're like, oh, well, you know, so I'm like, cool.  So you did all of that work and none of them matched your deal box. None of them fit your criteria.  Okay, how many offers did you make? How many LIs did you submit? How many of those were accepted? You know?  So, and if an offer's in play, okay. Okay. When are you planning on closing? Right. So this is just giving them like an awareness or you an understanding of like, they think they've done enough volume, but like they probably haven't.  And then you can use that later. So as far as timing is concerned, don't school them. Don't have a conversation about each of these.  Just like rattle it off and tell them like just first number that comes to mind last 90 days. Okay, cool.  How about this? How about this? How many of those SIMs did you actually get back after signing NDAs? know, and just the matter of like hearing all the numbers in one place, they realize that it's like, and how many fit your criteria just hits them.  They're like, wow. You know, so then you can use that later and be like, you did all of that work and you didn't even find a business that matched your criteria or you found one.  And we're putting two to four in front of you every month. That's what you did over the last 90 days.  Right. So again, we haven't told them the two to four yet, but it's something you can use later. Right.  Cool. So how soon would you like to acquire? What's the timeline? They're like, oh, in the next three months.  And it's like, okay, well, Axial has 2,500 closed deals from last year alone. And the average time was 130 days.  So these are usually experienced investors and professionals. Do you think maybe you need to look at your timeline a little bit different?  Okay. Let's talk about the next 90 days, at least. What would be a win? Most of them are saying good quality deals, conversations with owners, et cetera, et cetera.  Then I ask them another time-related question. How long have you been wanting to buy a business? This is different from when they started their search.  And actually, many of them have been like, how long have you been wanting to buy a business or be a business owner?  There's probably a much longer time horizon that they've been wanting to do this, but they only started taking action.  That's when I get into the doubt. You don't have to ask all these questions. It's like, choose the one that feels most.  But like, why aren't you doing this on your own? What's stopping you? What's getting in the way? Why don't you think you do this by yourself?  I might ask one or two questions. Then solutions so I can get an idea if they're reaching out to anyone else.  A lot of them are shopping service providers. And then you don't need to ask all of these questions. It's like, you know, just for you to get an idea of what the competition is.  The support question, is there anyone else you'll be searching with or someone making a decision with you? What do they think of this transition?  Like, you know, are they supportive? Do they know you're on the call? I can't tell you how many people like have partners that don't even know that they're searching.  Yeah, so and a lot of them will try to bring the partner on to the next call, which  things up for the exploration.  So you have to like do the whole thing with them, revisit everything and do the whole pitch with somebody that wasn't on this original call.  So you want to find out if that's going to be an issue for you. One of the things I say is like, um, totally fine if you're doing this on your own, but we actually work with a lot of couples.  We know how to navigate that and make sure everybody's on the same page. So I just want to know if we're going to be in one of those situations here so that they don't get defensive or gristly.  Right. Um, cool. You know, this, and then I added a few things. Um, great. I'll need you to give me 90 minutes to your laptop on that call.  And also I'm going to send you a video I'd like you to watch before. It you understand the common challenges in our thesis going into this call, but everything else is, is the same at that part.

55:39 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, that was extremely helpful, Athena.

55:41 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Thank you. Good.

55:43 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  Was it? Okay. Yeah. I'm like, I picked out like, uh, the nugget around total and or total assets available and then quality over quantity as well.  Like they're restricting geographic area and then like full-time searchers as well. Yeah. Um, yeah. They'll have all of those.  Come up in like the few calls that I've ran so far. So that's like, you've given me some sauce to use in my next conversation too.

56:07 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So thank you. Yeah. And that flow, now that I've added some more of that stuff in, like I have moved things around and like that flow is the jam, right?  So I would maybe pull back on giving a lot of feedback and advice on this call. So that will help with your timing because we don't, you know, it's just like right now you're just a doctor being able to figure out the diagnosis.  And then on the next call, that's when you can like be like, okay, this is everything I got from you.  And here's my concerns. Here's the things that I think you need to think about, right? And you do that before you go into the pitch.  So then it's like, first we need to get them bought back into their vision, what the problems are, what their challenges are.

56:54 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  And it helps a lot more if we can have that conversation on the first one. Yeah, that's helpful. I noticed that.  And. I'm like, we're at time. I'm like, I noticed that in my conversation today. was like, I tried to like loop in more context as I was asking questions.  And my calls yesterday went better when I just was like open-ended aloof and then like just let them talk.
