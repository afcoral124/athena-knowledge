  Hello.

0:02 - Ida Badenhorst
  Hey, guys.

0:03 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Hi. All right. Behind the note takers. Oops. No, okay. I didn't stop David's video. Hey, everyone.

0:15 - Anke Badenhorst
  How was your weekend? How was yours?

0:19 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  It was good. It's like first kind of chill one.

0:26 - Ida Badenhorst
  You didn't work this weekend.

0:28 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  What's that?

0:30 - Ida Badenhorst
  So you didn't work this weekend like you said you're going to do.

0:34 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Oh, I did work. What do you mean?

0:36 - Ida Badenhorst
  Oh, no, Athena. I thought you were taking the whole weekend off.

0:41 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  You're working on weekends now. Yeah. Well, that's what a founder does. That's what a founder needs to. So we're not in a position that I can take the whole weekend off right now.  That's okay.

0:56 - Ida Badenhorst
  I hope you get overtime, though.

1:00 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  You figured what?

1:01 - Ida Badenhorst
  I hope you get overtime, though.

1:06 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Well, you know, that's kind of the risk you take that, like, you work overtime, but also, like, I own the business, so I stand to gain.  So I'm fine with that, you know, I get to choose if I work, I don't have to, but I like the quiet time when there's no messages.  Yeah. But it's working. Yeah. I had to rewrite our whole service agreement. That took me hours, right? Because we have this new construction that we're doing, which got confirmation officially from one lender today.  So awesome. Austin verbally closed another person today, so he's just killing it.

1:51 - Ida Badenhorst
  Oh, wow.

1:53 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Anybody listen to the episode?

1:55 - Ida Badenhorst
  Yeah.

1:56 - Anke Badenhorst
  Yeah.

1:57 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  y'all it was my first first

2:00 - Ida Badenhorst
  What's that? It was my first podcast ever.

2:06 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  You've never listened to a podcast?

2:09 - Ida Badenhorst
  I know, it's not really something my generation does. So it's the first podcast I listened to. But it's nice.  They talk really nice about you, Athena. I didn't even know that Lindsay and Kevin's story was the first time hearing it as well.

2:24 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, they were amazing. I mean, I didn't know if they were going to talk about it. But like, yeah, like having to buy two businesses was pretty cool.  So I listened to it today, too. I think it's a good one. I think we've gotten 15 or 18 leads already.

2:43 - Anke Badenhorst
  Yeah, yeah. Let me see. Let me see.

2:47 - Ida Badenhorst
  Let me see. Wow.

2:50 - Anke Badenhorst
  Yeah, it's 15.

2:53 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  And one day that's like two months worth right now, I think.

2:59 - Anke Badenhorst
  Right. Yeah. Yeah, because we used to, we were on a flow of like 1.5 a week these past couple of months.  So yeah, that's, I mean, I'm just checking in with Austin the whole day. Like, you know, are you good?  Can I support? I'm seeing a problem here. Let's just quickly adjust.

3:17 - David R
  And he's like, thank you, that works.

3:21 - Anke Badenhorst
  Just making sure that he's not overloaded. He just responded back to me. He's just like, I got this with like three little, you know, strength arrows.  He's like, I got this.

3:33 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, he's good. I'm sure he's loving this. It's probably like you go into sales for all and it's like, there's not many leads coming through.

3:40 - Luke Gillespie
  I'm like, just wait.

3:43 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  You'll be drowning in no time. We weren't prepared the first time this happened at all. Like not prepared. Didn't have a sales process set up.  Like, I mean, we had a form, but it was like a really long form that people. It was on 4th of July when it dropped.  So I thought we were getting hacked or something. All of a sudden, just getting all these forms. This is crazy.  And we're not equipped to handle that kind of volume.

4:18 - Ida Badenhorst
  Austin came at the right time.

4:21 - Anke Badenhorst
  Yeah, Austin came at the exact right time. That's why today I'm just double checking all the systems, you know, because something works on a flow.  And then as soon as something, you know, you get an influx of something, you just got to check it's still working.

4:35 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, that's good. I spent a lot of time like making a process that really worked. And then we dialed in the scripts and videos and process and everything.  So, you know, Austin can just take all the calls and close everyone.

4:54 - Luke Gillespie
  Austin, something I was helping him with that off market deal, the online business in Canada with a H, did they, they didn't sign the LOI, did they?  So it didn't count as a signed LOI, just submitted LOI?

5:06 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  No, they did not sign in the LOI.

5:09 - Luke Gillespie
  Okay, all right. Just confirming.

5:12 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  What were you helping him on?

5:14 - Luke Gillespie
  Oh, he's asking me like success stories, things that he can be bringing up in sales calls, you know, things like that.

5:21 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay. Yeah, I want to make sure I have a view of that so you're not doing anything wrong. But I just want to make sure I'm managing what we're sharing.  So maybe put it in the HQ channel so I can just see and help course correct if he's picking up on anything that he's still learning the product and like where the edges are in terms of advisory and stuff like that.

5:50 - Luke Gillespie
  So I just want to make sure. Yeah, we can do that. Anka, it's the same. It's like what you used to do with me for the sales, you know.  So it's like Anka or Austin would ask me. Hey, do we ever find a manufacturing company? Because someone's asking about that in the sales or something like that.

6:06 - Anke Badenhorst
  I told Austin that we'd be working on a list for him. I already started setting it up. We just need to fill it in.  So Austin has a live list on industries and location on our clients that submitted LOIs on. So he kind of has a live list that we can just keep adding to.  Every time an LOI is submitted, we add an industry and a location, and that's stuff that he can play around with.

6:33 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Submitted or signed?

6:39 - Anke Badenhorst
  Well, we used to say in the messages, you know, we have a client that just put in an offer on an off-market HVAC.  So I thought that we could fill the list up with submitted.

6:52 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Well, the off-market HVAC was signed. The exterior skylights was signed. So I don't want to derail this conversation. Station, but like, this is why I need to approve what we're putting out there.  Because submitting an LOI is not success, right? Like signing an LOI is success. So we need to use because they're going to dig into that later.  It's something that he gets grilled on and everything. So I don't want to be feeding things like anyone can submit an LOI.  Okay. we need to get that list like finalized. Because he's in, he's going to be drowning in leads now.  So we're not going to have the time.

7:35 - Anke Badenhorst
  We just need to make sure he's supported. Yeah, absolutely.

7:38 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay. Okay, cool. And then let's get him just using those rather than communicating with Luke directly, just so I can make sure that I'm, or like doing HQs.

7:56 - Anke Badenhorst
  So I'm approving that. Yep.

8:00 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yep. Yeah, Luke, sorry, you're not doing anything wrong. I've been on so many of those sales calls that what you plan early on can end up being a trap later if we're not careful about how we manage it.  I just want to set off success that we're not planning traps for him later when they're like, what happened with that deal?  It's like, oh, it never signed. It's like, what do you guys do exactly? So, right. Cool. Yeah, anything jump out on the episode that was...  A good point or something that y'all were like?

8:36 - Luke Gillespie
  It was good. Like, there was some good plugs in there for us. Obviously, it's not like the whole conversation was just going to be name dropping Athena Simpson and Aquamats the whole time.  But one of the points that I thought that, like, made it look the best, made us look at the best point in the podcast was when Lindsay was saying, it was kind of in the beginning or maybe halfway through in the podcast, more in the beginning.  Lindsay was saying, yeah, I had searched for eight months. Like in contrarian thinking, and I basically had no progress.  And then when I started working with Athena Simpson and Aquamatch, I signed up in January. And by April, we had found the business to buy that we bought.  So that one made us look really good. That was like the high point for us.

9:19 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, yeah, I thought it was good. mean, beyond us looking good. Relative to this conversation of the process that we're doing right now.  What were your takeaways in terms of what they thought the benefits or the advantages of working with us are?

9:37 - Anke Badenhorst
  One of the points that stood out for me was the fact that they said, as soon as you find a business you like, and you start focusing on that business, your pipeline doesn't go dead.  So if something happens, you still have lots of deals coming in through your pipeline. Because if you're doing a search yourself, and you take the minimum of search.  Hours that you have per week and you focus it on one business, your pipeline goes dead. And if something happens, you kind of like have to start from scratch.  So the takeaway on our current process is kind of like as soon as a client starts digging into a business, we shouldn't slow down kind of like their deals.  should just keep going as long.

10:21 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah, I think I know what you're looking for, Athena. One of the things that they mentioned that was really like the most important about our business, it wasn't really bringing in the deals, helping them with the analysis, doing the quantitative or the technical things that we do.  It was the really getting to know them. Lindsay mentioned that we spend months getting to know them and personalizing their deal box.  And she mentioned how, oh, there were things that like Aquamatch, Athena helped them with their deal box and thinking about what they wanted that Lindsay didn't even know in her own head when she was searching before, right?

10:59 - Ida Badenhorst
  So kind of that match.

11:00 - Luke Gillespie
  So matchmaking side of things that we do, that was clearly what they said was the most important because they didn't mention anything about, they didn't mention much about write-ups and deal flow and advising and coaching.  They really only talked about that personalization and getting to know them and helping them with the deal box.

11:17 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Right. So it's a timely episode drop because our successful clients note that the fact we took so long to get to know them, the fact we were the objective third party that was weeding out things that weren't a fit, and then also helping them stress test and calibrate aspects that they thought they were open to, but they weren't really.  So that role of being that trusted guide, you know, like, okay, you say you're open to actually driving three hours.  Is that the case, right? Like, let's look at you all and get your feedback there. So more important for us to like really get to know them up front and look at them from many different angles.  Well, it's not just what they're telling us that they want, but also helping them stress test and calibrate that deal box as we go on in the early stages.  So I think, you know, one of the areas that we got off course a little bit was just taking their deal boxes gospel and just giving them exactly what they want and not really stress testing it or calibrating it.  But, you know, like when they say they're open to something, it doesn't mean they definitely want it. And also they don't know what they don't know.  So Lindsay and Kevin did not come to me and say, I want the advertising business and a design and build landscaping business.  Right. I got to know them and what they're good at, where they might fit into something, what their temperaments were.  I was looking at businesses knowing like they love their community. They're both very thoughtful. Find people. They'll be good in customer-facing roles where other people will not be.  You know, what are those qualities about them to make them uniquely them? And then how can we look at businesses and start picturing them inside of it, but also help them picture themselves inside of it?  Because they might get a different picture. And also the other point that she made about like running every deal, a lot of people come to us like that because they get so little deal flow.  It's like they'll try to make everything work, you know? So then also holding up that mirror and being that devil's advocate.  Is this really your business?

13:39 - Ida Badenhorst
  You know, is this the one? Yeah. Yeah, it was actually very nice in the beginning. She said when you introduced yourself, she was like, no, I don't think I really need this.  And how it actually changed her mind and how she now feels that this is so needed. There's something that the world thinks is not really...  Necessary is something that in her path with you guys, it's just she found out how needy it is, how much you actually need assistance with everything you're going through.

14:17 - David R
  Yeah, something I actually was asking myself when I was listening to Lindsay saying like, they found the business in April, right?  So they started in January, then they found the business, the first business in April. So it was like three months on search.  It was pretty fast, I would say, because with some clients, usually take more than, I don't know, six months or something.  So I was thinking myself, okay, what's the learning there? How is this possible to be this fast for this specific client?  Because we also have JG, I think he's in the same area in Austin. And we get really good deal flow for JG, but how can we...  You know, refine the process and understand the client and, you know, get good deal flow for JG so we can also get him something that fast as we did with Lindsay and her husband.

15:15 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  I don't remember the name. Kevin. Kevin, yeah.

15:18 - David R
  So this is something I was asking myself, like, okay, what's the learning there? What Athena did at that time, you know, to help them this beautiful business and then...  Also got them this other second business. So, yeah, this is something I was asking also. This takes time, right?  Like, they started in January and they closed the actual, you know, purchasing in October. So it was almost a year to, you know, to the whole process.  So this is something clients need to be aware of. Like, it's not something that's going to happen overnight. You need to, you know, work in the different stages and work with the lenders and, you know, so many...  So this is something that also stood up to me, like, okay, this takes time and it requires time, but you will get there at some point.  So yeah, this is a few things that I took away.

16:18 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  What do you think the learning was for them, like, getting a deal so quickly in terms of our timeline, like, being introduced to a deal within three months?  We didn't even start their search until February. So it was like two and a half months of searching that they found that one.  So did you think that you said you were thinking of the learnings? Like, what do you think it was specifically, if you know, or you can pinpoint what we did then, that maybe that we're not doing now, or that we can do more of?

16:59 - David R
  I think we... It's something we are actually doing right now to try to understand the clients, refine their deal box and understand really what they want, who they are, the psycho profile that we are doing also.  I think that could help us with a lot to make us understand what they're really looking for. Also something that she mentioned in the podcast is that when she was talking to a lender, they also looked at her father because he has some experience in something related to the business.  So I think this is also something we need to learn from the clients, like what's their relationship with their spouses, with their wife or the husband, their profile, their parents.  Go a little bit more deeper into these details because this also helps us to understand if maybe they don't have the experience, but they have somebody in their family or close to them that maybe can help with a specific industry or business.  So this is something also I thought, okay, maybe that was one of the reasons that she was, you know, feeling comfortable with this type of business because she has her father who has the experience.

18:13 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, it's a good point. Kevin has, you know, experience in sales and worked for a PR agency, which is very advertising adjacent.  You know, something that I'm realizing we're having to build now, and again, it's that curse of knowledge, right? Like I've been a business consultant for 10 years and entrepreneur.  seen inside a bunch of businesses. And also I spent months getting to know Lindsay and Kevin. I spent months getting to know Justin.  I spent months getting to know even Eli. And I was the one looking at businesses for them. So I was using my, you know, I look at businesses as a business consultant, not as an analyst.  I've never been an analyst. know, I've always been on the operation side when I'm looking at a business. How does it operate?  Where are its potential problems? Is this person capable of solving those potential problems? In addition to that, you know, just from the business consultancy side and the work that I've done, very, very much like understanding the person, because the person is usually what's holding them back from moving the business forward.  And that's always been the way that I acted as a consultant. was like part therapist half the time, you know, because the things that people do to hold themselves back in business isn't necessarily like a framework.  It's a mindset. So this work that we're doing even more is even more important, you know, and all the pieces that you all are building, when we start putting that all together, then we have, we can find a  The framework in a replicable, scalable way to act as psychologist, business consultant, you know, really deeply understand our clients, ideally on a level where they don't understand themselves.  Because you know how it is when you like have a friend and it's just like constantly like challenged on something or they, you spot the pattern, right?  They keep dating the same kind of person or they keep doing the same thing at work and they can't see it themselves.  And you're just like, it's so blatantly obvious to me, you know, and that's kind of what I love about being a consultant is I spot the pattern that they don't and then I can help them be aware of it, unstick it, and move forward.  So that's a unique skill set and a curse of knowledge that I have that somehow we have to implement into our process.  We need a process around it that we all can do. So the work that you all did was awesome, like such a good start.  And it just made me see it coming together. was like, this is so cool because we're, when I told, I was on the phone with a couple of the lenders today, like getting, we got a green light from one for sure about our new fee structure.  So, um, thank goodness we'll be able to keep going and it's going to make us competitive because I doubt anybody else is going to be able to come up with a structure that works, um, at least immediately.  So that's good. But, um, I was telling them, was like, you know, we're starting to do like psychoanalysis of our, our customers and like deeply understand them, their drivers and their motivations.  And, you know, you then using AI to be able to do searches and they're like, what, what, like nobody's doing this kind of stuff.  Um, so I'm excited. And. You know, getting inside the heads of both of our clients and our owners, which is kind of what Luke was doing while he was listening to those owner calls.  It's like seeing, like, what do we need to say to get the owners, like, from y'all are spam to, like, I'm really excited to talking to one of your buyers, you know?  It's like that process that we have to take them through and the relationship that we have to build with them, but also the relationship on the front end.  So the process that I built, spending hours on the phone with clients asking them questions, the hours that I spend on the phone with them in the sales process, like, that was all very intentional so that I can understand them.  But then how does that translate to the whole team when each of you have your individual table in the process, right, that we're, like, doing that part of the manufacturing process?  So did you guys get a chance to look at each other's part of the project? kind of like Yeah?  Who wants to shout out who? What was impressive or exciting or helped put a piece together for you?

23:11 - Ida Badenhorst
  I think my shout out would just be the diversity, because it's three whole different tasks, but it's in the same project.  So just sparring Athena how three people can do three different tasks, that was just amazing to me. So it didn't feel like it was a competition, it just felt like we were working together to make something better.  That was just so cool for me.

23:39 - David R
  Yeah, I think Ida's psychoanalysis was great, because I was really into Gilles' profile, and it was pretty accurate.

23:47 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah.

23:47 - David R
  It was so cool. Like, you can see, like, wow, the AI actually understood Gilles and understood his way of thinking and his personality.

23:58 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  It's just crazy. It's serious. Seriously, David, I thought the same thing. You did a phenomenal job on that. It blew me away.  And the fact you did it on Gil, you just signed an LOI, by the way, you guys. And of all the clients, I would have been like, oh, Gil is going to be the most risk averse.  And the profile nailed him. It's like, he's going to ask a lot of questions, but he actually has a high risk tolerance, which he did.  He asked a ton of questions, and then he'll jump. And he kind of did it. And I was like, holy , that was a blind spot I had, right?  Which is why it's cool to use these tools. Because now that you point it out with your profile, I'm like, oh, I see it.  But I actually would have thought Gil would be the one that would drag his feet a little bit on taking action.  And look, he's been in every single buyer's club, asking a million questions, taking the next step, taking the next step.  I'm scared to have the working capital conversation. I did it. It went great. We met. And then he's like, I need lenders.  And he's like, already reaching out, you know, like you give him a process and you give him information and he takes action.  And it's awesome. And that whole high integrity being very polite. I'm like, that's Gil, you know, so I think that's, you know, and then I see how these tables start connecting because you take something like you built.  And then you hand it over to David to actually like create agents that are going to take that information, take the deal box and everything and be able to like, okay, could we potentially have agents and AI scanning the listings and scanning kind of the manual stuff on our client's behalf, where we might have blind spots or biases, you know, like, I'm like, I don't like franchises, even though I know some clients are open to him.  So I'm going to like automatically try. I'm eliminate them because I don't like them. But if it's like, okay, David creates some amazing agent that goes out and scans the listings and, you know, and then that's the start of the process to start the RFI.  Or we create for the off market. It's like, well, here's this person's profile. And David, love the work that you started.  And I think we can take what you've built and actually refine it with this psychoanalysis. And rather than have it regurgitate what the client said they think they want, I think we should have it almost like come up with things that they would have never thought of.  So like the instructions to the AI is like, yes, they've said they might be open to dog grooming or this or that or the other, but, you know, they're kind of regurgitating things that they've heard on the internet or with their limited search so far.  So could we take it one level further and with the psychoanalysis, with knowing what their skillset are, with their career history?  With everything else, what industries might they be best suited to? Not necessarily the ones that they told us they wanted.  Or industries that they hadn't thought of that aligned with their hobbies and interests, but it looked like you were starting to build something going towards that realm.  So then when we brief in off-market, it's like using industries or areas that are probably more likely to be a fit than just going alphabetically through the industry list that they gave us, you know?

27:32 - David R
  Yeah.

27:37 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  And then Anke, I really like the case study format, the giving the mission. Did you guys read the mission statement that Anke actually built at the beginning of the handbook?

27:57 - David R
  Hmm.

28:00 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  We did it a little bit earlier in the week. Oh my god, I have so many tabs open.

28:03 - Ida Badenhorst
  I can't find anything now. And somewhere there's music playing. Oh really?

28:10 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  I hear music.

28:11 - Ida Badenhorst
  No, no, it's just a statement. It's a thing we're saying, like there's so many tabs open in my head and somewhere there's music coming from.

28:19 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Oh, yeah. So I love that. Okay, and then the internal profile template. So how, so now what I'm thinking is that we're going to need to connect the tables on some of these things, right?  So y'all are going to need to collab on that profile, the psychological profile, and then the GPT profiles that it creates from that.  And then Luke's part was a little bit down the line. But Luke, do you want to share any learnings from the...  Case studies that you thought were poignant to the beginning part of the process that you picked up on?

29:10 - Luke Gillespie
  Let me think.

29:12 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  And I know I'm putting you on the spot. That's a big question. But I'm trying to connect the dots because Luke was looking at the end, right?  Like two deals that we were able to get into signed LOI. It was more for him to kind of listen to like, how are we talking to the owners and walking them through the process?  But also, is there any learnings that you got from that that should be, you know, because we're about to start talking about templates, copy, connection to the buyer itself.  Like, did you pull anything from listening in on those that would be pertinent to the way we profile a client and or the way we reach out to or speak to an owner or the types of owners that we pick?

29:55 - Luke Gillespie
  Like, yeah, obviously, most of the. Analysis I was doing was looking at like the conversation that Athena was actually having with the owner.  But one thing that I think David and Ida would be good to learn is like seeing the email communications with the owner kind of before the call had happened.  Like on one of them, I said, Anke, Anke was emailing Athena's assistant and she was like saying some cute thanks to this one owner.  They were talking about going skiing. So just, you know, being personable and kind of relating and I could tell from those emails, it was a very personal email where it showed that we really cared about the owner and the deal.  And like putting in the effort, I know because I do a lot of these emails, putting in the effort to actually personalize the email, to talk about him going skiing with his daughter, really shows a lot when this guy's probably getting spammed all the time by private equity firms.  Hey, look at a buyer business, 7x EBITDA, let me know, you know, or like when I get these emails from brokers all the time.  I'm like, thanks for inquiring. Give me a call. It's just the most basic standard email. They're not knowing anything personable about me.  so I kind of learned that from the emails. I'm happy to share my screen and show them here. But that's what I would think would be relatable for David and Ida, although maybe it's not related to the psychoanalysis and all that good stuff.

31:22 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Well, was there any, and this was a long time ago, but was there anything that I said or we talked about early on about their connection or potential connection to the buyer?

31:37 - Luke Gillespie
  No, there wasn't a whole lot of that, to be honest. And from my opinion, from what I saw and listened to, because it was more about the seller on the calls.

31:49 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  This is something that, Luke, on your script, I've only dropped a few comments. We'll go through it all when we get to that point, because we're kind of pausing on the calls.  For a moment, but we're going to go through all the scripts. But something for you all to think about that like shifted everything for me.  Whenever I write a message, write any copy, any marketing material, do any piece of content, anything. I'm always thinking, so what?  Right? Because the person that you're speaking to, they're like, so what? What's in it for me? Why should I care?  Right? Because what a lot of people will do is they'll lead with like, I am this. I am this.  And let me tell you about what I do. And I am so great. Blah, blah, blah. Right? Like we talk about ourselves first, without very quickly getting to the point as like, what's in it for them.  And so just thinking about this, this is a great tool, Luke, for like, broker calls, owner calls, anyone you speak to at any point, if you can very quickly get to what's in it for them, and then talk about whatever you need to talk about, then they're, they're, they're listening, right?  Right. So It's like, I'm always thinking about like that person sitting on the other side, like, so what? You know, it's like, okay, what do I need to say to get them to be like, I'm listening, you know, because when you put them in the point of like, and you'll see this so much in like sales messages and whatever, it's like, I want this and I want you to think this and I think you should do this and blah, blah, blah.  It's like, I, I, I, and they're just like, I do not care, you know? And Anke and I have gone over like, gone thousands of emails together.  So when someone sends an email, like, I want you to do this. I'm like, who the hell do you think you are?  I do not know you. I do not owe you my time. Like, who do you think you are? As opposed to somebody being like, hey, I think, you know, not even I think, like, noticed that you did this.  It's really awesome. I've got somebody that might be potentially interested. They're interested in purchasing your business because they're so excited about what you do, la, la, la.  Like making that connection and showing them very quickly what's in it for them. They're like, okay, I'm listening. You know, so that's just a point I'll make to plant a seed on even on a telephone call, on a script, on any sort of communication.  Ida, it will probably help you too when you're trying to chase brokers. Like, hey, I've got a pre-qualified amazing buyer who is very interested in this business.  You know, we want to, like, they're moving quick. All the things that are potential, like, challenges. But yeah, Luke, why don't you bring up the copy?  And that's what I wanted to spend some time thinking about today because I know y'all watched the copy. We're going to connect the dots on the profile.  But then the next thing is, okay, let's assume we've got a really great profile where all of us deeply understand this client, maybe better than they understand themselves.  We are some. Collecting industries that we think would be a really great fit for them, not just ones they picked out like, I might be interested in dog grooming, unless it's like Joe, who it was like getting blood from a stone, the whole onboarding call.  then all of a sudden we got to ice and that man lit up, you know, and I was like, we got to find an ice business, you know.  So like those things, when they start getting like, like, imagine we find something that they're that passionate about, how they're going to be when we find a business like that.  They're going to be locked in and moving it a hell of a lot further along when they can see themselves in the business.  So if we're picking industries to reach out to that we're like, man, they might not have considered this before, but their skill set match, the fact they're into outdoors, the fact that they like this or that they're into this or, you know, they don't really like sales.  And we use AI to help us brainstorm to think of like what industry. Then when we're reaching out to those industries, the next piece is how are we communicating to them to get them to talk to us over the hundreds of messages that they're getting on a monthly basis, you know?  What are we going to say to them to get ourselves to stand out and for them to respond back to us?  So, okay, Luke, over to you.

36:26 - Luke Gillespie
  Okay. You want to go through those emails I was mentioning?

36:30 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, I think it's good. And then I think we can talk through what y'all learned about cold email outreach, and then we can bring it all together in terms of how we might approach the emails.
  SCREEN SHARING: Luke started screen sharing - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/297401733?timestamp=2194.622181

36:43 - Luke Gillespie
  Ah, yes. Okay. I included screenshots here in the case study, but I think it's best just to click on the HubSpot link real quick because then we can see all the emails.  Here we go. right.

36:59 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  ударing Fathom is open than I do.

37:01 - Luke Gillespie
  That is terrifying. No, these are just both write-ups I just finished. So like the last 10 of these would all get closed, but I just like finished them right before this call started.

37:10 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Got it.

37:12 - Luke Gillespie
  Okay, so a few of these that I wanted to point out. First was when we initially reached out, this guy said this.  So I don't think right now is the best time to discuss this for us. Whereas we have been profitable for most of the 18 years in business, last year was not due to multiple reasons.  We changed too many computer systems at once, new website, EMR, made some staff changes, sudden market changes with people spending on traveling versus services after COVID, launched new solutions, which defocused the team, while with my second new job was traveling a lot.  This year is already better than last, and we have a vision to sell to someone who sees the value in the brand.  And the 18 years in the Dallas market, pretty much one of the few large client base and surviving through a couple of downturns.  We are working on launching new solutions, marketing. This month and know this will get back, get us back to the good profitability we have seen all these years and more.  So here what's happening, what we see with a lot of our off-market leads is they disqualify themselves immediately. We haven't even told them anything.  We just asked one question. They're like, oh, no, no, I'm not the one. And so we see this a lot.  This is very common that I've seen with so many off-market leads. So we need to get better at comforting them and being able to not let them disqualify themselves.  Because sometimes we'll email them. They'll say, yeah, I'm interested. We send the three vetting questions and they get scared and they disqualify themselves.  And it's kind of hard to change their mind after that. So in response to that, Athena said this, this very kind of genuine personal message complimenting him on his experience.  So thank you for sharing your business's recent experiences and future vision. It sounds like you've navigated some significant challenges and changes, especially in the past year.  I commend your resilience and adaptability, especially in maintaining. A strong presence in the Dallas market for 18 years. I completely understand that now may not be the ideal time for evaluation discussion.  So still kind of validating their thoughts, not telling him, no, you're wrong, saying, yeah, you're right, now might not be a great time.  However, I'm genuinely interested in your business and the potential it holds, particularly given your impressive history and the exciting developments you've mentioned.  So highlighting the pros, the positives, the good sides that the owner was mentioning. Would you be open to having a conversation now?  If not, I would love to stay in touch and perhaps revisit this conversation when the timing is more suitable for you.  I'm looking forward to seeing your business thrive in the coming months and hope we can explore potential opportunities together in the future.  You know, it just shows a lot of personability, a lot of love and kindness. This sounds like a message like my mom would send me when I'm far away across the world and she's missing me.  Like, Athena's giving, sending as much love to this random owner that my mom sends me across the world. So I really liked it.  That's something that I would really highlight from kind of what was... Well, through this email communication, that's that, that's just what I was thinking, just the amount of effort and like emotions that was put into this response.  And so he comes back, sure, I don't mind a conversation, let me know if this week's work, this week works.  And so now they scheduled out a call. Okay, well, wait, okay, yeah. So after that, super heartfelt message that showed a lot of care and a lot of passion, then we kind of sent the three vetting questions.  And then he answered it with what he said, right? We've been profitable all the years, except for last year in the COVID year.  He told us normally generate that much revenue. Okay, and then they looks like they scheduled a call here. I may not have that, that, I may not have that email.  so they scheduled a call. Anke reached out. I'm Athena Zia. She wanted me to let you know she's really looking forward to your conversation today at 3pm.  Sent that at, that doesn't make sense in my Korean time zone, but sent that as like an email reminder, something that Athena has been talking about that would be very helpful for us definitely probably wouldn't have  The bandwidth to do it manually, but maybe automating something like that, very helpful to send someone a reminder. I know when I schedule my own random doctor's appointments or something like that, when they send me a text reminder, it's very helpful.  So then they did the call. They did the call, and then Anke sent the NDA after the call. After the call had went really well, Athena built a lot of rapport, all that good stuff.  I think, I'm pretty sure this is just the basic NDA template that we've already been working on. Yep, just that same one.  And then, okay, yeah. He filled out the NDA, and Anke sent this cute message. Okay, thank you so much for filling out the NDA.  Athena mentioned that you're on a ski trip with your daughter. We hope you had an amazing time. You know, this is like kind of that nice personalization that owners would appreciate.  This is something that, you know, sometimes when I talk to like five brokers a day, and one tells me that he's going up to the cabin with his daughter that weekend, like I might not remember to send him the email.  Have fun at the cabin with your daughter or something like that. And then, okay. Once you're back and ready, Athena would like to take a look at the last three years of P&Ls.  That's what we look at after an owner call. After they signed the NDA, we asked them for the last three years of financials.  Okay, and then being very clear about the next steps. After you send those over, I will set up another meeting for you and Athena to discuss further.  She's very excited to keep talking to you. Looking forward to hearing from you. Okay, this guy's, you know, really nice and personal.  Yes, had an amazing time with my daughter. We skied slash snowboarded all day and I only fell once during the entire trip.  You know, the lead's going well when they're using emojis in their emails.

42:32 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  that's a good one.

42:36 - Luke Gillespie
  He's talking here, attached to mold to P&Ls, still finalizing 2023. Okay, mentioned a little bit about the ad backs there.  Hopefully this gives Athena some insight into those years and would love to get her thoughts based on this. Thanks, Mel.  He said, oh, sorry, sent the wrong file. Send another one. Okay. Okay, and then this is Anka sends a cute little message.  Hey, Mel, thanks. Sounds like you had a great time. Personally, I've never skied, but knowing how unstable I am, even on rollerblades, I know I would be falling down the whole time.  So that's just a really nice personable message, something that's good to spend the time and effort into. Thank you so much for sending these over.  Will 23 be ready soon? So Athena will wait and have a look at them all together. If it's going to be some time, she'll have an initial look at these.  So kind of clarifying, setting some expectations, like, hey, we don't really want to move forward if you can't get us the most recent years.  But if you're unable to, then I guess we have to, then I'll hop on a call with you, right?  And then, okay, after that, Mel says, okay, thanks for your email. 23 will be ready in a couple of weeks.  So it would be great if Athena can review these. 23 will have revenues around 1.1 million, but we'll have a loss.  Not sure exactly how much. And then Anka went into, okay, Athena's going to take a look at what you sent.  In the meantime, she's asking if you could provide us with some ad backs. And then here's some information on ad backs and a template you can use.  So giving him, kind of explaining to him how ADVACS and SDE works as it can be kind of confusing.  So he's kind of helping him help us, right? And then looks like there was even a little template you guys included to have him fill out.  That sounds very helpful and useful. And yeah, that's about it. Okay. Okay, yeah. Hey, I'll go see the attached spreadsheet.  If there's any way we could do a quick first review, it will help me a lot as I'm trying to make some quick decisions with a local group on direction going forward.  Okay. Again, just trying to get those 2023 numbers. These aren't any of the conversations I had highlighted to look at, but we can just keep going through to see the whole process if you want, Athena.

44:41 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  No, I think that's a good stopping point. So what themes or what did you all pick up on that?  Just the one conversation. What did you notice?

44:57 - Ida Badenhorst
  I was personal.

45:00 - David R
  Yeah. Really? That's I'm going to say. Yeah. It feels personal. It feels like a human. It doesn't feel like an AI or spam or something.  And you are addressing actually the different points in the email, right? Like he's saying, I'm not ready for this and this this.  And you are addressing these specific points. So he feels that you actually understand what he's going through. And then that's why he wants to move forward because you understand his point of view or his point at this moment.  Yeah. think it just feels close. It feels like a human conversation, basically.

45:39 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah. And on the call, I mean, Luke did a whole great breakdown point by point on how I talk to him and stuff.  But I spent, I'd say, half the call just getting to know him. You know, like he's telling me his daughter was graduating and like how much he cares.  And I was like, God, you sound like an amazing dad, you know? So I don't, that's probably, it's one of those things that I always do that, again, it's like, how do I get this stuff out of my head onto y'all and into a process?  It feels like slowing down to spend that amount of time just chit-chatting with someone, right? Right. But look at how pleasant that was to be like, can we get your financials?  Can you give us your ad backs? Can you send us your P&Ls? When are you going to get your P&Ls over to us?  Like, that's essentially what we were doing, but like, it was a very pleasant conversation, which he was willing to work with us on.  And ultimately, that got assigned LOI also. Now, Luke didn't understand the connection between the two, because it was like, wait, this business was at a loss, etc.  But to fill the gaps between those two, Josanne, who is the other deal that you looked at, Spa in the City, she wanted to continue consulting.  She didn't want to like run the business. But she did see herself as a consultant. And one of her absolute strong points was on inventory management.  Like she had it managed down to the drop, which a drop of an injectable can be like $75. So her inventory control was insane.  And something that is not very common, right? It's very easy to just not have good control of it. And that's your biggest cost center because a med spa is like doing the Botox, the injectables, like very expensive little potions that they're using.  She also had figured out how to get like a great buying power by like joining a group and getting the ability to access things as if she was doing a lot more volume than she actually was.  So she's very sharp on a lot of these things. And Mil, when I talked to him, The reason why they had a loss was that his business partner, who was the operator, died.  And Mill was working a full-time job. He was always just this kind of silent investor giving some consultancy and stuff.  His business partner was operating it. His business partner died. And also where they were not strong at was inventory control.  So I knew that even Eli were already under offer with Josanne. I know they had a really good relationship with her and that she wanted to consult.  And that if they bought the two together and Josanne went in, automatically would like double their profit overnight, just implementing her inventory and purchasing control system.  And now the two together met their SDE requirement. Oh, gosh, I'm sorry, guys. Someone's at the door. Give me two seconds.  I'll be right back. Okay.

48:59 - Luke Gillespie
  I'll be right back. Dina's chair looks comfy.

49:07 - Anke Badenhorst
  I know, right? I'm sitting on the worst little bench right now.

49:16 - Ida Badenhorst
  My chair is actually not very comfy.

49:20 - Luke Gillespie
  Really?

49:21 - Ida Badenhorst
  Yeah, I just pushed it back so I can just lie back, but it's actually just so straight.

49:28 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  I keep locking my family out of the house. There's two locks, but one of them we can't open from the outside.

49:37 - Luke Gillespie
  I keep doing this to them where I get home and I lock both locks and they can't get in the house.

49:43 - Ida Badenhorst
  I think it's Athena time.

49:46 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  I was like, you can't come in. So anyways, those fitting together was how I made that deal work for even Eli, because even Eli needed like 500.  Okay, after that service to make it work. He had the kind of like team management leadership experience to do the things that Josanne was not good at.  She was not really big on developing team or leading or whatever, but she was exceptional at the operational inventory control, etc.  So they could take her into the distressed but long history med spa that also was a sponsor of the Dallas Cowboys.  You know, like they had such great assets there, but they had a downturn because the operator died. So it was very explainable.  And it was a very nice tie up to do those two together. So they actually ended up getting both under offer.  And then Eli let his ego get the best of him and decided to go work for a big name company instead of closing on these deals.  So it's very frustrating. But anyways, so I guess that whole thing is, it's always when I talk to the owner that the magic starts unfolding, which is why I try to get them on the phone.  And like Luke very rightly pointed out, they disqualify themselves and they put up objections. If they're responding and giving you all of that, on some level they're interested.  They just don't think it's possible or don't know it's possible.

51:28 - Anke Badenhorst
  Yeah.

51:31 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So in which case it's an objection handling. And I guarantee you that really nice email that was drafted and responded was probably Anke.  Like using AI, like Athena AI bot or whatever. And, you know, we worked on this a lot, like initially when she was, when she was doing the inbox and even to some extent now, you know, because we get so in the rush of things.  Making sure you read every point. And. You're responding to the points makes people feel listened to, right? That you're not just responding to like one part of that.  And I can, you know, I can tend to do that very bad. Like I'll pay attention and respond to the point that I care about and like ignore the rest of it.  So I've had to train myself and still do a manual like, ah, I need to look at that thing.  So all of that to say, what do you think from looking at past successful conversations, looking at the cold email training, doing this upfront work of understanding the profiles of our clients, compared to what we've been doing for our off-market?  Where do you think, if any, there is some disconnect?

52:57 - Luke Gillespie
  Personal touch.

53:00 - Ida Badenhorst
  Taking the extra two minutes just to really understand the email before you just reply.

53:10 - Anke Badenhorst
  Yeah, would say just trying to do volume and quantity, just getting bulk stuff out instead of quality outreaches, personalized messages, personalized follow-ups as well.  Keeping conversations warm instead of what we've been doing is bulk sending and then the deal gets lost or it gets dropped off the table and then again bulk spamming to try and get them back on board.

53:54 - David R
  Yeah, think bulk is one of the reasons, but also the message that we are... For example, we want to buy your business, but why?

54:04 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Why do you want to buy my business?

54:06 - David R
  What do you see in my business that makes you think that you want to buy it? Can you understand the why behind the stuff we're sending the message so people can see, okay, that's why this guy wants to buy, because he's in this industry, because, I don't know, different points that we can touch, but try to actually reply to this, why?  Why do you want to buy my business? Like, what's the reason?

54:32 - Ida Badenhorst
  Yeah, because a lot of the owners actually ask, why is your buyer interested in my business? And they're like, we should have started with that.

54:46 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Correct, correct, correct. Good, good points, David, the why, you know, so what, why? We can cover off the objection before it comes.  Yeah, exactly. Hmm. thinking, budget. anybody's new say standpoint, they're So By answering that question, you know, what's the responses that we're getting the most?  Which business? You know, so we're reaching out to somebody that has multiple businesses and they're like, what business are you talking about?  You know, or reaching out and they're like, why do you want to buy? Or do you even have experience doing this, right?  Or like, I think we're still using, like, I'm an investor, you know, like we're just using these outdated templates.  Or the templates have evolved a lot, you know, to look like samey, samey is like some of the private equity stuff.  So we have the opportunity to be uniquely AccuMatch now, you know, because all of us care. All of us are thinking about the why.  All of us love, you know, the owner stories and the possibilities of getting the owner matched with one of our clients who we also really care about.  Or at least I'm assuming that y'all feel the same way I do. But like, we get to know our clients a lot and want to see their it's because we pop  Success. So we can portray that in the way that we reach out to business owners, which will be different from what everybody else is doing, because everybody else is like, thinking people are money motivated when they're not.  Obviously, money is a part of it, right? They want to be fairly rewarded, but like, at what cost, you know, at what cost?  How expensive is that money to like, their people, their family, their communities, you know, their, integrity, the thing that they built, their baby.  And honestly, people just want to feel heard and seen. Like, my God, it is so hard being a business owner.  It is so hard being a business. Every single one of these business owners has so many war stories to share, so many horrible things that they, especially if they've been in business for a couple decades, like, I mean, his business partner died.  Yeah. He was like, while he had a full-time job that had him flying around all over the world, like all of his, you know, money tied up in that business.  Like, can you imagine? That's crazy. So how do we solve this? So we know, we know what we're not doing right.  What can we do to make it better? How can we solve for this? Because we know we still need to do volume.  We need to, like, outreach at scale in order to get some responses. But how can we potentially solve the, you know, spammy field?  Or are you spam? That's the other objection that we seem to be getting a lot these days. I can't say I blame them.  The way we've been reaching out, you know, the, like, bulk outreach. The bulk re-engagement. And we were doing it because.  So we had to, and that's what we thought the process was. So again, no blaming or saying anybody did anything wrong, but we have an opportunity to make what we're doing a lot more effective and actually get owners in front of clients if we refine the approach that we've done.  And the good thing about doing bulk outreach that's kind of spammy is we know the main objections that we can now overcome.

58:27 - Ida Badenhorst
  Yeah. We can send them the podcast. If anyone asks me for this, I'm like, listen to this podcast.

58:40 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yes. So let's assume we've connected all the dots with the profiling and we've got a really great substantial profile on each of our clients that we really understand.  We've either self-identified or incorporated. Some technology, some AI to help us get an idea of what kind of industries would be a good focus for us to start with.  And then we reach out to these people. So what can we do to reach out to them in a way that overcomes some of these challenges or objections that we've been getting?

59:20 - Anke Badenhorst
  Well, we can work on the copy.

59:24 - David R
  Yeah. Yeah, think we need to answer, because some people also say, who are you? Like, who are you? So we need to answer a bunch of different questions in this copy.  So we address, you know, the mainly objections that people usually have. So who are you? Why are you interested in my business?  Like these different steps. It doesn't have to be very long, but we could, you know, in a short sentence, just try to address these different points.  I'm sorry. And also when I was listening to the call email course, they say you can use template, but part of the message has to be personalized.

1:00:09 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yes.

1:00:10 - David R
  So we need to find a way to personalize these sentences of this first line that you're using, and then we can use the rest as a template so we can scale the outreach.

1:00:26 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So I imagine something like, hey, I'm Athena. I'm an acquisition matchmaker. I have a client who has XYZ skill set or lives in your neighborhood or told me that he loves your business and would love to buy it.  I noticed you did XYZ or your business did this or is a big part of the community, which is why we're interested.  Have you ever considered selling your business? Right. Something like that. And again, I don't know exactly how the tech works, but I imagine if we have all these great profiles...  Of our clients. And we build some AI tech or something to be able to pull nuggets that personalize from the business website or whatever it can find.  It's still the template, but there's a personalization. Like, why this client? Why this buyer? Right? Or why this buyer is interested?  And why we're interested in your business specifically?

1:01:34 - Anke Badenhorst
  Yeah, it can definitely do that. It was part of the training that we just did on how to do that with Milshake.

1:01:47 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  The tool we're already using.

1:01:50 - Anke Badenhorst
  The tool. That's the reason that I used it. That's the reason I chose that tool because I did this course.  Um, but, um. So yeah, it definitely does the first line personalization. The thing that it doesn't do is the grab something from the website.  So currently in the training, they're like, get somebody and that person is your first line writer. That's their only job first line writer.  But like you just mentioned, I'm pretty sure with AI, AI can pull some nuggets that we can use so that that person has some idea without having to manually go through the That was kind of like the idea, right?

1:02:38 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  I mean, does it really have to be a person? David, you'd probably want to answer better than anyone, but there's got to be like, I mean, when was that thing filmed?  A couple years ago, maybe before AI?

1:02:54 - David R
  It was 2022.

1:02:55 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  mean, geez, we're trying Something for my inbox right now. It's drafting my emails for me and it's not too far off from what I would draft.  It's crazy, you know? So with a bit of like, I don't know, I don't know what it works, but like APIs or coding or whatever, if we actually train it on what things would be a good thing to call out, right?  And this is the vision I have and I don't know if I'm crazy, but if it has our specific buyer profile, that we've done the psychoanalysis, that we've done a really good job of like getting all the information about them, what would make a good business, you know, what relationships do they have?  Then it's like, oh, my buyer's father actually worked in this industry. You know what I mean? Like it's, I can't see AI not being able to do something here where it's like...  All this great information that we're collecting, and then be able to, like, check the dots between the businesses that we're reaching out to.

  I don't know. think we can try first to train an AI and make, you know, we can maybe with the websites, we can have an AI to, just to come up with some small sentence as a personalization stuff.  And then we have the template as well, that connects, you know, the different, this personalization line and then follows the rest of the message.  But also we have the, you know, the trained AI that also knows about our client and we can connect this other AI to, you know, to finish.  The rest of the message, I think it is possible. I mean, you are using Make, for example, Make, which is the tool that we are using to connect Airtable with HubSpot and all this stuff.  And they also have agents inside of Make. And you can connect the OpenAI APIs and you can use different prompts and make different agents to perform specific tags.  So we can have different agents or different OpenAI APIs and we can just train it to do the different steps.  And then the output is, I think, is what we want or very close to what we want. And we can see if it actually works for us.  But yeah, I think it is possible. I mean, there are so many AIs right now. You're so happy talking about AIs.

1:05:59 - Ida Badenhorst
  Keeping out. He's in his happy place right now.

1:06:06 - David R
  Yeah, he's in a happy place.

1:06:07 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  One of the things I got excited about with David joining the team that I knew... Oh, what'd you say, Luke?

1:06:14 - Luke Gillespie
  I said, that was amazing to listen to, David. I'm jealous I don't know as much AI as you do.

1:06:22 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  We, you know, the thing about AI is that, at least from... The way I work with it, it's like you still need subject matter expertise to analyze the output, right?  And it's so easy to use it and have it be generic. But, like, if you use it thoughtfully and expertly and really work with it...  this goes to the briefing thing that I told you all about, right? Like, what you put in, you get out.  So, like, you give a crappy brief to AI and you get a crappy result. But, like, you really work it.  And I think I told you all this. When I caught 10 of my students using AI when I was a lecturer, and we caught them because we thought they were all cheating, you know, like sharing their papers.  That's how generic the answers were coming out because they were using GBT. We were like, like my TA thought they were all cheating.  And they were, they were using AI, but she thought they were like cheating with each other, you know. And she's like, I thought they were sharing papers.  So that's the thing. It's like I can spot when someone has not worked AI very well, you know, and like they like give it not a great brief and it just comes out very generic.  But if you use it thoughtfully, creatively, and actually really instruct it to do exactly what you want it to do, like the output that Ida got was phenomenal, you know.

1:07:55 - Anke Badenhorst
  Christina, even in the recruitment, like the cover letters people send in. They all sound exactly the same because they just push the job description through AI.  Everybody is sending in the exact same cover letter.

1:08:08 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah. The things that stick out are the pattern interrupts, right? Luke turning up on a webinar like, well, I noticed that.  The pattern, I'm obsessed with pattern interrupts. I try to make everything I do be a pattern interrupt because that's when people pay attention, you know?  So use AI to be a pattern interrupt if we use it creatively and, you know, have it fed in from different sources and that sort of thing.
  ACTION ITEM: Coordinate with Ida/David to create comprehensive internal profile for Peter. Include personal insights, financials, skills, experience, risk profile. Use AI/psychoanalysis. Ensure 10th grade language, no jargon. - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/297401733?timestamp=4117.9999  So what I want us to build is kind of like step by step. So I think we have some pieces now that you all worked on last week that need to be kind of connected together now.  So We have an opportunity to do this either with somebody we already know or we have a new client that is going to be starting their search June 1st.  So we could try to experiment with like building a new profile with this new client because we're going to have to do it anyway.  So do we do it in the old method and then have to redo it later? Or do we take the opportunity to use all those inputs from the sales calls?  And he came back like six months later, I think. So we have some old sales calls where I had like two, three calls with him, then the additional call, then all the onboarding calls and the business questionnaires thing that he answered.  And I think we should be feeding that through, too, because they actually write thoughtful responses in there and then build out a profile that's like psychoanalyzes and like with EDA stuff.  also gives us a really concrete deal box and all the other things that Anka put into that profile. And then we can come together and be like, does this make sense?  Does this give us everything that we need? Can we use this to then pull industries? Right? So that's kind of what I'm thinking is probably the best next step with all the pieces that you all put together on the beginning part is let's put our heads together.  And then David and Ida, particularly on the AI stuff, like how can we, you know, just not cross swords, but like maybe one feeds the other.  I know like somebody at one of the marketing events that I went to, they built different bots that like, or different agents or, you know, different GPTs that like, one was a copywriter, one was a strategist, one was the this, one was that.  And then sometimes they pull them all into the same chat and be like, okay, now with this, write this kind of thing.  So I feel like there's some collaboration between you two to then like bulk it out into. A profile that is usable for the whole team.  So that when Luke reads that, he's looking at the deals further along, he's also able to get in their head.  The whole team's working off the same understanding of the client, but also we can use that profile for the future parts of this, like pulling industries and then also training GPTs on personalizing the emails about the buyer to the owner.  What I don't want to do is all this work go in vain, right? Now we need to start like Anka's analogies.  all have a table. So like, how do we connect those tables together? So that first piece is like, how are we getting to understand a client?  We have a new client that we've already done all the onboarding and stuff with. He doesn't know the process.  So if we want, we can get him doing some personality assessments as well, right? If we feel like that would be helpful to do some additional stuff or if we want to ask.  Some additional questions on like, what family members do you have, you know, that might be or like people in your immediate vicinity or whatever, you know, like David pointed out.  So we have an opportunity to do some more of that. And then also see, I mean, with him, it's really interesting because he wants a potential like complementary business to what he's already doing.  So it's a little bit different than some of our clients, but it's still knowing all that. He's not sure what industry he should be buying, right?  There's still like a whole bunch that he could potentially buy. So it's like, well, we've got all this information about this person.  We're now getting inside their head better than they understand themselves. What industries might be a fit for all of that?
  ACTION ITEM: Draft 2-3 simple outreach email templates (couple lines each) based on new personalization capabilities. Coordinate w/ David for AI integration. - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/297401733?timestamp=4364.9999  Right. And then we need to do some work on the templates. I don't think it needs to be very extensive.  I think we may be direct. craft two to three outreach templates based on the personalization that we think is possible.  So what can go wrong with templates, and Anke and I did this a little too much in the beginning.  So some of those things that we sent, it was like too many words, you know? So we've refined our sales understanding so much better because we're selling.  So it needs to be very simple couple lines, right? But I guess what I don't know is how possible is it to use AI to personalize at this stage, or do we need to do something a little bit more manual in terms of our templates?  So maybe Anke and David, you two can have a conversation about that.

1:13:55 - Anke Badenhorst
  Yeah.

1:13:55 - Luke Gillespie
  If you want to personalize something for the specific company, you can... You can, I think, very easily give the company link to whatever AI you're using.  I use Perplexity, but you can just give the link and tell them what you're doing, the situation, right? Explain it.  Have a good prompt and tell them, find me something specific about this business that I can talk about in my intro message so that it looks personalized.  The AI can search, see their posts on Facebook because these old boomers are all using Facebook for their businesses.  See, they won this award. Oh, community's best landscaper in 2023, blah, blah, blah, like something like that. And AI can just make that into your message like, hey, I loved how you helped out this family in your community in June at the so-and-so event.  Like, that's awesome. I have an owner who has that. I have a buyer who has those same values, something like that.  AI can do that very easily.

1:14:49 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Well, guess what, between somebody manually doing that for every single owner versus could we build something to do that process?  So it appears as if every email is personalized from us, but we're able to do it at scale.

1:15:06 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah. I mean, I don't know how to build the AI agent or bot or whatever you want to say that would already have those instructions and all you have to do is copy and paste a link.

1:15:15 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  But yeah, you're still going to have to copy and paste a link manually every time.

1:15:19 - Anke Badenhorst
  But me and David is currently working on with OpenAI APIs on generating client summaries for the channels for us at the end of day.  So that's currently what we're working on, David. And I'm pretty sure with that work you did, it's very easy to just change the process to connect it to like an Excel file.  And it reads all of the, it reads all of the websites and it outputs like that personalization item. And then we can just from that, that whole thing that just goes into Milkshake, just like an upload.  Because that's the way Milkshake is set up.

1:15:59 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  We can just upload the entire thing. Yeah, think so.

1:16:03 - David R
  I mean, the prompt that Luke just mentioned, I think it's a system prompt. So we can use the same prompt for every single website, and it pulls every website and analyzes it, whatever it does it, and then it shows us this message.  And then we can continue the process and build the message. Maybe we can try to automate as well the uploading to MailChick.  I don't know how easy that could be. But we can try many, many things. I'm just thinking so many steps right now to see how this can work.  But I think it's possible. We just have to figure out the way.

1:16:45 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So without going too crazy with tech, right? Let's trial with Peter's profile to see if we can connect all the dots between the work bit.  Anke, Ida, and David did. So you guys might need a little sidelined conversation about, you know, because I see some overlap potentially in like what Ida did and what David did and how it fits into the profile.  So just like maybe getting together the three of you and assigning who does what to fill out a profile.  Um, and then thinking about the, David, I know you're already looking at agents, but could we then use that profile to train it on like what industries?  And then we need to write some copy that in theory would be able to be personalized. And then look into how heavy of a lift is it to try to get some level of automated personalization.

1:17:54 - David R
  Yeah, I think we need some copies because the thing with AI is that that's better. Better the context that you give the AI, it's better the output.  So if we give it, you know, this is the template I want for the message. This is the copy I would like to see as an output.  And then just change, you know, the first line, just change this for this specific line. But we have a template, so the AI doesn't go crazy because sometimes the AI just, you know, hallucinate or they just do some weird stuff.  But if we have some, you know, clear instruction, we want this output, we want this template, this length, for example, because it could be too long for the AI.  So the different instructions, I think the output, it will be really nice. But we need to set up this instruction, like how do we want the copy to be, how long, which type of words do we want the AI to use, for example.  You know, these different instructions, so we can provide a good context.

1:19:04 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So I guess where I'm struggling is who does what at this point and how do we keep this so it's not too heavy of a lift on everybody because we still are doing deal processing, right?  Right. So it'd be ideal to I mean, we need to do Peter's profile. Right. He's going to be starting search in June.  So I kind of see this is an opportunity to try to collab around that. Anke, what are your thoughts on what I just mentioned?  Yeah.

1:19:41 - Anke Badenhorst
  So let me quickly outline the current process and then I think we'll work off of that and adapt it into what we want to actually do.  So the next step in the onboarding process is I usually take all of the full transcripts. I his LinkedIn, I take his resume, business characteristic forms, all of the sales in show calls, everything that I have, and I feed that into GPT, and it kicks out a buyer profile, a deal box, and an internal profile.  From there on, I give those three documents with all of the videos to Ida, Luke. David, did I give them to you as well?  Don't know, don't remember. I think it was to Ida and Luke. Ida goes through the video, she actually listens to it, and she picks up on nuances and quirky little things that the GPT missed, and she basically builds out the profile with those and just color it in.  Then it goes to Luke, and Luke checks the facts in terms of SDE industries, those basic technical pieces to make sure that the profile is correct.  From there on the deal box in the buyer profile goes to the client to approve it, to say, yes, I agree with this or I would like to make these changes.  And then those two get turned into an investor profile, which we put on the website. Then David takes the deal box and he tells Masam to find the leads.  After he gets the leads, he puts the leads onto Mailshake and the bulk emails go out. So if I pause there and I go backwards and I start from the beginning again, the first step is the profile.  So if we want to create an entirely new profile and we don't want to do deal box buyer profile, internal profile, we want to create this new profile.  The first thing I think we should determine is, is this, should we have a client facing profile and an internal profile?  Or should we just have, we're building out the one profile and then we're pulling out the stuff that we want the clients to just.  Check off on. And then this profile, this is our internal profile. This is what we use. This is our psychoanalysis.  We don't want to show them the psychoanalysis we did on there. We just want them to check off on the important stuff like minimum MST, this and that, this and that.  So I'm seeing two things. I'm seeing our full profile. That's the first thing that gets built. And then we do a summarized thing that the client can sign off on.  That's the first thing. All right. Who does that? That's the first question that we have. That's a collaboration, I feel, between Ida and David because that's the psychoanalysis profile that Ida did.  Am I correct?

1:22:44 - David R
  Yeah.

1:22:51 - Ida Badenhorst
  Yeah.

1:22:51 - Anke Badenhorst
  And then just turning that into a mini profile.

1:22:55 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Let's start with a full profile first before we summarize it. So Aka, I think you'll need to collab too, right?  You built out the whole framework for the profile, so understanding the context and then dividing up who actually fills in the different pieces.  like, it feels like a lot for one GPT to be able to do on its own. I don't know, it might be, because I know a lot of detail gets lost if we like shove too much through it, unless y'all know a better way of doing it.  So that's where I think, you know, you know, the overall output. David knows the tech, the AI, how we might be able to achieve it.  He knows the psychoanalysis of it. And then also the deal box parameters that we need, right? And then pulling in some of the work that David did on summarizing the deal box industries that might be of interest, that sort of thing.  So it might be worth... So worth... Going through that profile and just deciding who does what or how. Maybe just spend 30 minutes with each other just assigning who's going to take each piece or whatever, or can this all be done in one go?  Because it's a pretty extensive profile that you built out.

1:24:22 - Anke Badenhorst
  Yeah, I absolutely agree. And in the past, I've noticed that with GPT especially, because the more bulk you feed it, the more details it will lose.  So I agree with the fact that, you know, it might be worth having, let's say, three different GPTs do three different aspects, feed it the same information.  So the one GPT focuses on deal box parameters. The next GPT focuses on a, like a buyer profile from a, from a, like a business perspective.  And then the other GPT. It does the psychoanalysis that Ida set up. And then with those three combined, then we build out the full profile.

1:25:08 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  I would challenge you to throw out what we've done so far. Don't try to make it fit the process we currently do.

1:25:16 - Anke Badenhorst
  Okay.

1:25:18 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  We're starting with the internal profile first. So there's a whole bunch of stuff that you put on there. Personal insights and motivations, long-term strategic objectives, financial summary, right?  That's stuff that David was doing on, like, how do we pull these pieces together? You know, they're buying power, what they have available, assets.  That's all really important stuff. Their skills, experience, superpowers, risk profile, business fit criteria, meaning and interest, passion fit mapping.  All those things that you've pulled into the profile. How are we using different GPTs or who's going to pull in that?  Information. So we have one super comprehensive profile and then use that to then build out the right, you know, it's like once we, in my head, we need the full comprehensive internal one, and then we can use that to build out these different pieces, like the investor profile and that sort of thing.  And honestly, I think that can be improved greatly anyway. So we don't have to do things the way we've done them.  Sure. Don't try to wedge it into, it needs to fit those four boxes on the, you know, I don't think it's that great.  You know, there's definitely room for improvement there. So I'm not wedded to that. I think it could probably be made exceptionally better.  And if we're starting from this point, right, then if it's got that analysis of like how they view themselves and what their risk profile is.  Imagine that then being fed into a GPT that's like, now make an external facing one for brokers and owners that communicates who this person is.

1:27:09 - Anke Badenhorst
  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I get it. Makes sense. Because what we've been doing in the past is kind of like focusing on the bar profile in the deal box, and then out of that creating the internal profile.  But now we're reversing it and building out the full profile internally, and then just extracting the client facing stuff.  Right. If we think about what I did well when I was doing this on my own was understanding the clients better than they understood themselves.

1:27:40 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So we need to create a process to do that internally. And then from there, then we can build the other pieces out that are necessary.  But like having a super comprehensive understanding of each person that we're taking on. And then it's like, okay, well, some of this stuff is external facing, right?  Some of it is like, here's who this person is and what they're good at and what they're Their skill set is and their background and career, you know, for the brokers.  And all the brokers probably care about is like, how much money did I have? You know, I think we could probably make it much more.  Also, I was the one that created a profile. So I'm just talking  about myself. It's a really hard read.  It is hard to read it. I don't think it's very enjoyable from the broker's perspective. just looks like, oh, they put a lot of thought into this, whatever.

1:28:29 - Anke Badenhorst
  And Jackie was like, I don't know what color underwear Athena's clients are wearing.

1:28:35 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  You know, but it's like, now that we've been doing this, that was a theory at first. So we don't have to keep doing things the way that we did them.  It's like, well, Luke's on the phone with 23 brokers a week, right? What do they care about? What can we put in that profile so that, you know, it's like just grabbing them and it's a pattern interrupt again.  When we started this, not many searchers had websites. Now they all have websites with their dumb.

1:29:00 - Luke Gillespie
  Deal criteria, the same as everybody else. So how can we continue to be a pattern interrupt and use this opportunity to like, we don't have to do things the way we did.

1:29:12 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  What's the right way to do it in the Acquimatch way that gets the end result that we want, which is brokers being like, holy , this person's impressive, right?  Or owners being like, wow, this sounds like a great person that I would love to work with. Or us understanding clients so well that we're putting deals in front of them that they're like, I never would have thought of this, you know?  And it was interesting, Lindsay's whole thing. She's like, initially, I thought I wanted just operational things that weren't creative.  But then I realized through this process that I want to build something, you know? So, yeah, okay. Okay. So, again, I don't want to drown you all in extra work.  So I'm trying to think of also how do we do this in a way that doesn't... We're pausing the off-market stuff because we know it's not as effective.
  ACTION ITEM: Review new comprehensive profile format when ready. Ensure it provides enough client info for deal reviews. Focus on experience, job history, financials in simple language. - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/297401733?timestamp=5410.9999  So it's cool. We're all good there. Hopefully that buys you some bandwidth to have a little bit of time to dedicate to this.  And Luke, I don't think there's much for you on this aspect of it. So we can just get you blasting out the write-ups and doing your thing and getting on top of that because it's going to be a short month for you too with some time off.  And then I see Ida feeding in from the psychology perspective, David giving some ideas on how we could potentially use tech, and Anke, you pulling this all together because you know what the output needs to be.  So is that clear enough? I don't feel like it is, but I imagine you guys will figure out amongst yourselves who does what.  And you tell me if it ends up feeling like it's going to be way too much time in and around what you're doing.  Um, next week, obviously I'll be off. So we won't have another deep dive, um, until after the holiday weekend.  But what I would love to see for, um, when I'm back or however quickly you think, like when you guys get together, can you talk about like timings in terms of like, how quickly can we get an internal profile?  Um, because Peter's search is starting soon-ish, So we should probably get at least into a place where we can get him approving his external profile, um, and get an idea of like, uh, what the internal profile looks like, and then start to map out just a few templates to test, like, if we were to like build out something that automated the personalization, both from, you know, why the buyer is interested in their business and what's so cool about their business that was interesting to the buyer in the first place.

1:32:01 - Luke Gillespie
  Can I input something for the profiles? Because I won't really be working on it. Let's call them buyer profiles and not investor profiles this time.  then, yeah, because Athena had mentioned, oh, what's the most important information that the brokers want to see? And I'm kind of thinking of how we could improve this.  One, all the brokers want to see is numbers, how much liquid cash they have on hand, how much they've been pre-qualified by the SBA, and also their experience.  But like actually knowing their experience in the previous position, because that's what I wanted to input is I really want to be able to read that profile real quickly before a call and know exactly what my client's experience is.  Because these profiles that we have right now, I'll read them, and I don't even know what our client's experience is after that.  It's just a bunch of these highfalutin adjectives, strategic, goal-oriented, passionate, leadership skills. Like, can we just take like literally what is on their resume?  Just don't take this. The exact company or any private information, like you could take their previous position, right? Senior executive, account leader, whatever for Steve.  Because sometimes I have to go look into their resume and see their position.

1:33:12 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Because I'm going to be honest, looking at those profiles, I don't even know what their background is. And that's what brokers care about, numbers and background, like job history.  Right. Okay, Luke, really good point. And something that it sounds like we got away from, but we used to de-jargonize the profiles.

1:33:29 - Luke Gillespie
  Do you remember this, Anke?

1:33:32 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, so if jargon's made its way back in, this is something that we need to brief the GPTs on, right?  Like 10th grade language that a broker could understand or a blue collar owner could understand. Like no jargon. This is something that I think is one of, like something from Alex Narbozzi that I have taken away, but I don't think people talk about enough.  It's like, it's like, speaking down to people to do 10th grade language. Right? 10th grade level language. It actually is very, it's a very sophisticated form of intelligence to be able to communicate complex things at a 10th grade level.  Mm-hmm. things with owners that I was like really conscious not to do, not to say SCE and EBITDA and blah, They don't know what any of this crap is, you know?  But it's like, hey, I know you probably, you know, ran some things through the business to make your... Taxes look better.  That's totally okay. Do you know what some of those things are that aren't necessary to run the business? That's ad backs, right?

1:35:10 - Ida Badenhorst
  So I don't know what an ad back is. Solid discretionary earnings.

1:35:15 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  I don't know what that is. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Like, you know, my health insurance and my car. I don't actually need my car, but I ran it.  My accountant told me to run it through the business. You know, it's like, and still to this day, I'm going to, at some point, like give you guys the deep dive on how the acquisition.com team explained valuing a business in 10th grade language, right?  And use this multiple thing. was so  cool. So if we can get to that level, it's not patronizing. It's not demonstrating any less intelligence.  In fact, it's demonstrating more intelligence that we're able to take these concepts, these stupid terminologies, like all this, like foreign language and just put it into common sense.  It's words that, Anybody can understand, no matter what their understanding of like deals are. So it's a great point, Luke, and especially in our clients, like humanizing them.  We want to make sure that we're not using jargon, especially if we're putting in front of like blue collar businesses and stuff or like brokers that are representing like eight track deals.  Like they always talk about it. I'm sure Luke gets this, some tech guy that's coming in, wants to work in a landscaping business.  And I don't think he's ever put on a pair of work boots in his life, you know? So, yeah, that's a great point.

1:36:37 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah.

1:36:40 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So that'll be good instruction for, and you can give that kind of, I work the AI hard, you know, and I like, I teach it like what I want, 10th grade level, don't use jargon, don't use those long dashes that make it very clear that it's AI.  You know, there's like certain outputs that it's just like, if I see the long dashes and copy now, I'm like.  Like, oh, somebody used AI, you know, keep telling Anke, delete it. Don't use it. Don't write that, you know, because like, we all use AI, so we know what the outputs are.  And it's very obvious when someone's using it. But if you work it hard enough, and you brief it well enough, you end up getting something that doesn't look like AI.  It's actually like really helpful. So cool.

1:37:26 - Anke Badenhorst
  Well, but you can do it. Like, it took me like five different briefs to tell the Athena bot not to use emojis in the emails.  Like, it took a few times. It kept putting in emojis. I'm still unable to teach it to not do the dashy, double dash thing.  It's, I'm, I think I need to try harder, give it a bunch of slaps.

1:37:53 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  But that's, it's not getting out. It's a new thing. started, didn't start that way. It used to do. Colons, and then that probably, like, you know, enough people were like, stop doing the colons, it's obvious, now it's doing long dashes or whatever.

1:38:07 - Anke Badenhorst
  Yeah, emojis and emails, like, I need to know you really well or be really comfortable with you to use an emoji.

1:38:14 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  It's like few and far between. So like, yeah, when it was like drafting emails for me, it was like all these emojis, like, stop it.

1:38:24 - Ida Badenhorst
  Oh my goodness. And then it's like, I'm like, only emojis.

1:38:29 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  No, no, that's fine. I like, I don't, you know, everybody has their own style. It's very you, you're very colorful and positive and that sort of thing.  But like, it's also a generational thing. Right? So millennials are very like, about emojis and emails where like, nobody else cares, but like, we care.  So. Emojis came out in my lifetime, right? Like, so even email. Like, when I was a teenager, like, emails started coming out, and so we got the first look at a lot of these types of technologies, and we made, like, certain, it's weird, apparently, like, we're using emojis wrong, too, like, the emoji, like, the crying emoji is, like, the laughing emoji, and, like, I use the crying laughing emoji, like, I don't know.

1:39:22 - Anke Badenhorst
  But I remember when we started using emojis, it was, like, an X and a capital D for, like, really excited.  Like, did you guys ever use, like, punctuation emojis because emojis didn't exist? So we did the punctuation thing, and we knew all of the different emojis by just typing.  A dash, capitalized D is, like, nerd, because it's, like, the glasses.

1:39:48 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Uh, when I, when I was a teenager, we would send code on pagers using numbers to communicate with each

1:40:05 - Ida Badenhorst
  I've never seen a pager in my life before.

1:40:08 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, I had a pager and we would like send digits and codes on pagers.

1:40:16 - Anke Badenhorst
  Yeah, so I remember the first text message and we had to like click a button three times to get a letter.

1:40:24 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  I wanted to send a text message like every letter, click it three times, you know. So anyways, that's how old I am.

1:40:34 - Anke Badenhorst
  I want to end this time since I started late.

1:40:36 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  I apologize, y'all. The episode drop-in today just ended up having some other stuff to do because of that. And also spoke to two lenders today.  So feeling good about that situation much better. Do y'all have any questions on next steps? Anke is going to arrange with Ida, David, Luke.  Just carry on with the write-ups as usual. But I think when the profile is ready. Let's have you review it and see if it's going to give you what you need to get inside the head of our clients when you're reviewing it.  Because that's really the point. Since you're the one that's kind of doing that final touch, it's like, can you, does it give you enough to get inside their head, deeply understand them and look at businesses as if you were them or even better than them.  So how's that?

1:41:22 - Anke Badenhorst
  Yeah, sounds good.

1:41:24 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay, great. Any questions y'all are you feeling good about this? Thank you for all the work you did on the last ones.
  ACTION ITEM: Start new off-market handbook. Use old one as reference, but focus on new processes/learnings. - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/297401733?timestamp=6091.9999  Awesome stuff. Really helpful. It's going to be useful, you know, through this process as we refine it. So sometimes we all need to kind of brain dump, brainstorm, get some concepts together, then bring it all together.  And we'll have a, we might need to start, Anke, like maybe a new off-market handbook.

1:41:48 - Anke Badenhorst
  So we're not. I was thinking.

1:41:50 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, let's start, start fresh and just start building one and use that one as reference for the things that worked, but rather than trying to overwhelm ourselves with all the stuff that didn't work.

1:42:00 - Ida Badenhorst
  Yeah. Sounds great.

1:42:00 - David R
  That's great, yeah.

1:42:02 - Ida Badenhorst
  Very cool.

1:42:02 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Thanks, y'all. I'm excited to see what you come up with. This is feeling, I don't know about you, but it's feeling really good and seeing all your stuff come through last week.  I was like, we're going to nail this. We're going to be so  good at this, like in two months, three months, when all those new clients start hitting, we're going to get so many great opportunities as a result of this work.  So you just wait. This is a worthwhile investment of time.

1:42:27 - Anke Badenhorst
  Yeah, absolutely.

1:42:30 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Cool.

1:42:30 - David R
  Yeah. Yeah, he's fun. Yeah.

1:42:32 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  It's so fun. But like now that we know it, right? Now that we did all the wrong things and we spam people and we got all these responses and got all these objections and got all these conversations, now we know what to do with it to like use that tool better, right?  And better than using it to get the results that we want. So it's awesome. You know, like you have to do these kinds of volume of things manually and get it wrong and, you know, and we've gotten it right in a lot of ways too.  So it's like now. Provogating all that, like, okay, what do we need to do at this point to make it all better and bring it all together?

1:43:06 - Ida Badenhorst
  Yeah.

1:43:08 - Anke Badenhorst
  Amazing.

1:43:10 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  All right. Enjoy the rest of your day. I'll see you all tomorrow.

1:43:14 - Ida Badenhorst
  Thank you, guys. Bye. Thank you. Bye. Bye.
