  advanced play.

0:02 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah, I'm glad he's excited about this business.

0:06 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  It's, it's, it feels like such a good fit.

0:10 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah, Ryan, how serious is he about getting a plane ticket to Canada? Did you bring that up to him?

0:17 - AcquiMatch Team
  Well, um, yeah, I, I try to like, at the end of the call, I push the relationship like, hey, like, let's get to this person.  I kind of think he's like, he's like, want to make sure like, I'm, I'm showing up with the financial capability that's gonna make me feel better on the call that I can actually finance this.  he's like, so if we can talk about that now, that's gonna make me feel better in the conversations. He kind of like, blocked me a little bit there was like, Hey, like, let's, let's make sure I can finance this first is where I brought him to the, you know, so that was a good call to have.

0:52 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Sounds like he knows the path forward at least, like, and I think you just need to keep reminding him, like, run on, didn't talk.  Solar financing until three months in. right, so like we just need to give them the confidence. It's like You need more information to figure this out and with private capital providers, like It's an investment play, you know, so like you need to have enough information Well, you heard me say all that, but that did that that makes sense trying in terms of why we can't just make an introduction right now So I didn't honestly realize that I was I was like, oh, yeah, let's do that now and then I was talking to this is just making more sense Yeah, so we we haven't had an opportunity to like use this play.  Yeah, so it's like new for you guys and cool exposure I know exactly who I want to introduce him to and I'm actually going to reach out to him to just get a sense Like hey got this really cool deal um Feels a little bit small as it's something you guys would be interested in and um and he has been  and really like almost like mentory to me. a lot of these investors like really they're excited about women trying to like you know they're like women are great investments so they give me a lot of time more bandwidth than I think men would probably get which you know it's it's cool for me but he has been really supportive and always open me having conversations so I'm gonna reach out to him anyway and just temperature check like if he'd be open to hearing a deal like this or if not like if he knows who we could bring it to it's a little bit small like typically they want to see at least two million in enterprise value but Andrew will have to do like make a sim and an investment deck and everything like that because they're they're essentially like it's a fund but they lend instead of taking equity.  Right but with his experience like

3:02 - AcquiMatch Team
  That was a thing. That's rather common because they talked about it more often. You can see he was excited about that.  So that was really good.

3:12 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So cool. you know, this guy's like weird, my sales coach introduced me to this woman and I'm on the phone with this guy.

3:20 - Luke Gillespie
  Like, what even is this? then it's like, no, we literally have the perfect buyer for your business.

3:27 - AcquiMatch Team
  Yeah, it's so good when you show up with a wire like that. And segue into Chris today. He blew it out of the water.  Like, he crushed it. Man, like, was worried at first because I didn't smoke until two weeks because he's been away.  And so, like, hey, need to jump on and talk about this. And so he showed up. just like, I was like, this is the way I think it should go.  He's like, okay, I was like, a little bit nervous and how well he would follow that. And he just followed it to the tee.  I mean, They liked them. They were kept saying, okay, this sounds really good. This sounds like a good fit, yeah.  So that's really great. I'm happy to keep pushing that one forward.

4:14 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Is he, did you talk to him about also getting on a plane?

4:18 - AcquiMatch Team
  Yeah, he's, he's open to that as well. So I think the plane of both is the same. like, next thing is an hour and a half call.  We discuss operations and such, and then, and then after that, be like, this has been great. Like, let's, I love to meet you and see the place.  And they got, they have acknowledged that on the call as well. Like Chrissy brought it up, you know. So yeah, it went as good as possible.

4:47 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Amazing. So on that note, I caught up with Will from acquiring mines earlier. And the, so the webinar was done with the sale lease back.  broker. So I don't know if you watched the webinar or just listened to the episode. So you know how he talks about he used the sale lease back broker.  That's who the webinar is with. So that would be the broker that Chris can talk to as a potential like option for all of the investment properties.

5:22 - AcquiMatch Team
  Perfect. I'd love to, is there a link to that because I can just watch that before my call tomorrow with him.

5:28 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, it's on the webinar section of acquiring minds.

5:32 - AcquiMatch Team
  Got it.

5:33 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Um, sale lease back. Uh, and I can't remember because like I started with that and the guy was diving straight into the strategy and I was like, whoa, whoa, whoa, let me actually listen to the episode.  So I have some context because he went straight into like the how to's and I was like, I need more.  So I didn't go back to the webinar, but now that you've listened to the episode where understand like how like what he did, then this guy is like how to do it and how he helps as a broker apparently.

6:00 - AcquiMatch Team
  with the sale lease back so um but this is exciting like two really big awesome off-market deals with our very competitive buyers as well you know so it's like these are the one these are the two they're the most capable um so it feels right yeah and finally something for them both like hook into because they really haven't had either of them haven't really had that up to this point yeah they both like when we did a kind of called after to kind of debrief they were both like i love this off-market because they they've gotten a few on markets and they see you got to get to the broker you got to have this competitive deal so they're both like this is they're both excited about that aspect and so the play with off-market we've got to make sure that they don't rush

7:00 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  to an offer. They got it. Like, no, no, no, like, I totally hear you, but I need to understand a little bit more.  So like the, the carrot, the carrot, the carrot, you know, um, without making it feel like they're getting  around.  But I mean, your guys have been waiting for a year to talk to somebody. So I don't think they're going to be that worried.  It sounds like Andrew's more worried about getting the Canadian guy an offer. But it's like, I haven't even seen your platform yet.  How could I make an offer to you? You know, like, so I think just got to get them comfortable with it.  Like, you're going to have to build a relationship simultaneously while wrapping your head around it for us to get an idea of the financing options.  And hopefully by the time we have a lot of clarity on the financing options. And if it is a big seller note, this guy loves you so much that he wants to do that.

7:51 - AcquiMatch Team
  Yeah, Andrew's biggest thing I've been thinking about. He is a little bit of an roster syndrome. he just feels like, I told him last time I was like, no, give it, give it.  stuff more credit. I'm like, I think he's like imagining there's probably a better buyer that he could is talking to them, right?  And I was like, look, this is off market. This is through a contact with the end. This guy's he's talking about this other interested party, but who knows, like that could just be talk.  I was like, in my mind, like, this is it your friend center right now. So, yeah, there's a little bit of that with Andrew is he's like a little bit like, am I supposed to be here?

8:35 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay, I is. mean, that I totally get that though because on the property management deal, I had the same thing.  Like, every day I was like, this is big, you know, eight million dollars, like, am I capable of doing this?  And then it's three million dollars worth of people thought I was, you know, like, whoa, and everybody's like, of course you know, so it was weird to be in that, but  Get Andrew to replay to himself the size of offices and agents and deal sizes and things that he's been involved with.  Like how many millions of dollars worth of transactions did you do last year? You don't think you can handle a $1.3 million even a business?  Remind like get him to talk through those numbers of himself and like big himself up. So like how many millions of dollars of transactions did you do last year?  How many of you done in your lifetime? What team sizes have you run? How much volume was the entire team that you were managing and leading doing?  He's run offices before. Like how much were they doing in sales? Like the revenue on this is going to be a drop in the bucket based on what he's done.

10:02 - AcquiMatch Team
  Yeah, and there's like 20 employees, so he's like, you know, he's like, that's like, don't know where you're like managing that many people.  And I was saying, I was like, look, I've been around all types of managers for large amounts of people, and just off my interactions with YouTube, I think that you would be probably a step up in management if you took over this business.  you know, I was like, if I had to guess, I had to bet, I would bet that if you took over and people saw it down to me, you think that, oh, I'm happy this is we're going this direction, right?  So yeah, trying to sell, you know, pushing up a little bit.

10:56 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  When they meet the seller, you know, it's like, am I at this person's intellect level and my at this person's level, like, and if they get along that well, it's like, well, then you have a bunch of skill sets, like you said, you know, like a step up in terms of the management, this guy doesn't like managing people, that's not going to be enjoyable for the people on the team.  So just in that, he's going to build value. So yeah, just keep picking him up and getting him to see it.  The more he sees himself in the business and feels comfortable with that, the less the number is going to matter, you know, and it should feel scary.  And honestly, the bigger deals are going to be better, there's 28 people instead of two. Somebody wants to go on holiday or somebody gets sick or whatever, that's awesome.  Are they all employed in Canada?

11:50 - AcquiMatch Team
  No, they're USA 1099s.

11:54 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Oh my god, even better. She says, like, all American people, wow. That's great.

12:01 - AcquiMatch Team
  Yeah, I'm getting the tingly feeling on this one. Yeah, it's kind of the sweet spot. It's just, you know, us being involved, pushing all these hurdles, getting consistent, to making sure they don't, they like a roadblock, is that how I feel about it?

12:32 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, good. Cool. Any other deals you want to talk through? think it'd be good to just get a sense of how deal flow is going with this new system.  I know we had a temporary stop, so just checking in and feeling in on that.

12:47 - AcquiMatch Team
  Sure. You guys want to talk about deal flow? David, you want to start?

12:53 - David R
  Yep. So we had a few changes in the Georgia searches. So we added, we had the countess now. And today was actually even better the airflow for Georgia.  So we got that 40 plus deals for Georgia, which is really good. So I'm going to start doing the same for the other clients for, uh, or do, or JB.  I'm going to add a few other searches to, to the different platforms. So we're going to start getting more deal flow for all of them in the on market in the on market.  Yeah.

13:35 - Luke Gillespie
  I'm thinking maybe they could have just brought in duplicates that we've already seen in Atlanta, but that's great if it worked out.  Hopefully.

13:42 - David R
  But yeah, sorry, I'm sorry, David, keep going. Just a thought that I didn't bring up this morning in the meeting.  Yeah, I mean, it was the first day that actually the airflow went up. So we'll see tomorrow if he continues going.

13:57 - Luke Gillespie
  That was a great idea. David found out himself, you know, and, and thought of that.

14:00 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  improvement. So it was a great idea. Yeah, something that I've been thinking about a lot and I haven't brought it up with any of you, but I hear about like remote businesses all the time where the brokers like in a town and they just list it in their town instead of like a remote business.  And I just feel like we're not capitalizing on those opportunities where the brokers are not thinking through the marketing and they're listing opportunities that could be opportunities, but it's like in some photos town in the middle of nowhere.  And I don't know how to solve for that, but it's something that's been on my mind and you all are much more capable.  So I'll plant that seed with you is like, now that we have the volume or now that we have the coverage that we do amongst the team and we have David, we have an opportunity to try more things and get more volume in without like completely crippling us.  And that might be one of those places where we find those hidden gems where we do nationwide searches. and maybe lean on the deal team more to to review the you know remote or something.  I'm actually I'm not going to come up with the solutions. You all can figure it out. I guess what I'm saying is that I think there's a lot more opportunity out there that we miss because brokers aren't and they're just listening at it and whatever.  So like I was talking to a potential client and they found something that was like a remote business but it was listed in like Idaho or something.

15:25 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah, that's interesting. There's probably like a remote filter you can put on the search sites.

15:31 - David R
  David, maybe just write that down on your to think list and we'll think of it at the top sometimes.

15:35 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, there is a remote filter but it doesn't work because the brokers don't list it as remote. They list it in their local city and then you have to do some unearthing.  You have to either read the listing or look little bit into it to see whether it actually is a remote business.  that's why they're not coming up on those remote because Kumo has a remote filter or the other ones have a remote filter but the brokers aren't.  Brokers are like You know, 70, 80 years old and just wasn't it in their local town because whoever started that business there got recommended to the local business broker instead of finding Ryan on empire flippers when he was there.  So it's just another potential source for us now that David's here to start experimenting with that or seeing, know, because what I want us to get good at is finding the hidden gems on or off market and also those random places in the middle of nowhere have far less competition.  So if it's not listed as remote, but it actually is remote and it's in some random town that nobody's looking at.  Guess what? We buy our our clients more time and opportunity than we might. If it was listed as a remote only this business or listed in New York or one of the metropolitan things that they're looking at.

16:53 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah, yeah.

16:58 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Sorry, I was interrupting the deal flow flow.

17:01 - David R
  So this is for the market, then for the off market, so we changed the industries for clients. I think we mentioned to do this in the last meeting.  So we started running campaigns only for those new industries. So we don't waste time on budgeting the industry that doesn't make sense for every client.  So we started doing this today, actually. So in this way, we're going to see how that plays out. But I started putting, you know, pushing some leads into hops, when you check and bring the campaigns, and we'll see how it goes in this week for the off market.

17:38 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Great.

17:41 - AcquiMatch Team
  And then to add, lastly, for David, David pulled as many brokers as he could find in LinkedIn, in the Atlanta area, and then he said, why me with the list?  And then I messaged all of them individually with kind of like a short little, hey, we worked with some  Fires in your area. We'd love to see what kind of opportunities you have. Let me know how we can do that.  Um, so I did that this afternoon. Um, so that's a new strategy for trying out.

18:11 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Great. Um, if you need. We, we have surf as a tool that like will log it and have spot log them as a contact so you can talk to on good about using that.  Um, we might just need to set you up with them another license, but it's a really quick way to be able to like log a conversation to have spot and log them as a a contact.

18:37 - AcquiMatch Team
  Okay.

18:38 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Um, Do we, so it sounds like a problem is DL at the moment. Is that right?

18:48 - AcquiMatch Team
  That's right. Right.

18:52 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So do we want to start trying to do some of those things for D.O. also or what's, what's our thoughts there?

18:59 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah. I think next we sent to do it for Gil. I told David to do it for Gil. Um, we can come up with a priority list for where to go in order.  I guess deal would be number two or maybe you want to make it number one. think David and Ryan, you guys could talk about that tomorrow.  I'm sure.

19:18 - David R
  Yeah, I can do both, yeah. Gail and deal.

19:21 - Luke Gillespie
  I have two pretty good deals for deal right now.

19:26 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  One, I'm just waiting for the broker to get back from vacation on the 16th.

19:29 - Luke Gillespie
  One looks like a good deal as well. There's just some weird numbers issue with it. They're the brokers waiting to get a Q and V report back because there were some weird things with the accounting above that.  It looks like a good business, but, um, yeah, I think we're, we're all right on deal at least for being halfway through the month.  But, but I get the concern, uh, you look at David's sheep.

19:50 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  The numbers were a little, a little Well, and also we got to like zoom out from like the numbers and like, what's their feelings about how this is going, right?  So they've looked at. two businesses that weren't really like ones they were excited about. So, you know, Gil has now looked at a couple that he's excited about.  So in terms of like feelings of the service and where they're getting. again, I'm not trying to change. So these are Luke.  It's like you're processing the deals as they're coming in and that sort of thing, but some things for Ryan overseeing whole thing.  And David, you know, it's like, what's a general sense of how our clients are feeling right now. So, CM and AA, it's like, sweet, they've got an off market.  They're really  excited about that buys us little bit of space, not that we'd want to stop delivering them deals.  CM has, you know, the widest geographic he should in theory, be getting more deals than anyone else, because he's made his options open so much.  But the perception is reality, right? is reality. deals like, well, we looked at two deals that like we would never put a picture to ourselves in and it's not really a fit and we're not moving forward on it.  We're almost halfway through the month, we haven't seen another deal this month. Like, how do you think they're feeling?

21:06 - David R
  Yeah, you're right.

21:08 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So where we left it with deal because they haven't seen a new deal this month, right?

21:15 - Luke Gillespie
  Not yet.

21:16 - AcquiMatch Team
  We got them a third deal in the first month and the last day of the month. So it's you know, it's more or less a deal a deal for this month.  I think, yeah. So that was Are these still working at though?

21:32 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Do they have any active deals right now?

21:34 - AcquiMatch Team
  No, they're not working it. I'm gonna follow up with them actually soon. I could follow up with them today about that.  That was the one that he kind of kept pushing back on me. was like, I was like, push it more, like, you know, so I can follow up on that.  And also they still have not ruled out the club. Dustin actually likes I love it.

22:01 - Luke Gillespie
  don't know why the nightclubs such controversial business, I think it's great, especially in South Florida.

22:07 - AcquiMatch Team
  But yeah, but Lindsey doesn't like and they're like they're kind of on the call. she was like, kind of she was definitely like, no, no.

22:17 - Luke Gillespie
  it was like, he was like smiling, he was like, I got a lot of kids.

22:22 - AcquiMatch Team
  we haven't we haven't decided on that. But, you know, obviously, if she's pretty firm, like, no, I don't need to call anywhere on that.  And honestly, the concerns she brings up, I would be very concerned as well. They say that according to the land, Lord, and how this area works, they want to rebrand that every two years, because that's how they keep getting and it takes an investment.  And he thought she was at least one of any club experience, like there's going to be a significant investment after less than two years after purchasing it.  And that scares them. And I get what they're saying. and so. They haven't closed it out, but he's still trying to push for a site visit to go there when the clubs are going on, which would be pretty funny.  So they're still up in the air, but they're not, they haven't sunk their teeth in like we're talking about these other deals and we want to get them something like that.

23:23 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, I mean, so there's there's an element of like educating them that it takes a minute for your search to warm up.  So we want you to like move these early ones as far down as you can, because it ups your skills while the really good ones come through, because it can take a little bit while we're warm and not search up particularly with off-market.  Luke, on the chew, you're working what are your feelings in terms of Keith, syncability.

24:03 - Luke Gillespie
  One is this package of five cold stone primaries. So it's pretty simple, pretty easy to run those businesses, right?  just going to own the franchises and the numbers are amazing. So that's what I really like about it. And they're open to franchises.  it looks interesting, but again, I'm waiting for the broker to get back from vacation. The other one is this aluminum metal and steel manufacturing company, powder coating and decorative fence.  So yeah, they do manufacturing. I can share my screen. The picture right here, right there, painting fences right here.  Again, looks like a good business. Good team built out. The numbers were great. But then the this broker is telling me that there's there was something weird with the accounting.
  SCREEN SHARING: Luke started screen sharing - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/250999093?timestamp=1483.295286  So they're getting a double check by a QAV accountant. But then the broker is telling me that he thinks they're at it.  Yeah, because he says these guys were really bad with their accounting and that their accountant that they were using, this accountant was good enough for when they were doing 500k in revenue, But then they kept on this same single little mom-and-pop accountant or something like that once they grew into a $5 million revenue business, something like that was for his explanation.  the broker is getting a Q and V done to verify the numbers, make sure everything's reflected accurately.

25:23 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay, so to be clear, this is not a manufacturing businesses is a powder coating business.

25:29 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah.

25:30 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay, let's make sure we're using the correct terminology, right? Is this steel manufacturer? Is it genuinely a steel manufacturer?

25:40 - Luke Gillespie
  No, I think this title must be wrong. Yeah, I think maybe there was a mix of maybe this title is wrong, but I also just got full access to this and today because I had to talk to the broker to be able to the Sim.  A manufacturing fabrication of aluminum iron and steel products.

26:00 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  What's the powder coating have to do with it then?

26:03 - Luke Gillespie
  I'm sure they do both. Again, I haven't deep-dived yet, but let me.

26:10 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Because like, so I think you all are going to have to figure out how you're seeing on top of all of the legislation changes with the new administration.
  ACTION ITEM: Research tariffs (US, Canada, Mexico, China). Prepare presentation for team meeting on Friday. - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/250999093?timestamp=1576.9999  Right. So that we're getting ahead of that with clients. So the tariffs, are you all familiar with what's happening on April 2nd?

26:32 - Luke Gillespie
  Yep.

26:33 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay, tell me what's happening.

26:35 - Luke Gillespie
  There's a lot of tariffs are going out. don't know the specifics, whether it's the 25% with Canada and Mexico or the retaliatory tariffs or the 10% with China, but yeah, there's a lot of tariffs going on.

26:47 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay, Luke, as the person that's analyzing all these businesses, doing the write-ups and advising our clients, do you think you should know exactly what's going on with the tariffs?

26:55 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah, I think those are the, it's going to be the US, Canada, Mexico, and there's a lot of exemption.  for certain NAFTA agreement businesses and I think manufacturing something like this might be one of the exemptions.

27:09 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So what you just told me is you don't know what's happening with the tariffs. So I would like you to make sure you're up to speed with exactly what's happening with the tariffs because it's going to impact nearly every business that's doing imports.  And it's also going to be an opportunity for folks for certain folks. So do me a favor. Learn what's going on with that.  I want you to also bring it to the whole team in one of your meetings. So Ryan, I think we need to start instituting that in your guys is like meetings of like.  This is like material things that could seriously impact people. And if we're doing analysis of business and we're telling people that these are investment opportunities, we need to make sure that we're ahead of that so SBA changes.  This is a tariff. Are you guys familiar with the SBA change that just happened?

28:05 - AcquiMatch Team
  Something about no longer US non-US citizens are eligible for certain parts of SBA.

28:14 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Any part of it. So any person that's getting an investor, the investor also has to be US or green card, right?  So they can't even have foreign investors anymore, which is a huge material change also. But the tariffs, manufacturing, all that sort of stuff, like I want you guys to make sure that you're up to speed with that.  Otherwise, we're going to not be advising people from a good place.

28:38 - AcquiMatch Team
  If we don't know what's coming down the track or how that's going to impact that.

28:46 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah. Cool. So the reason why I was asking is because there's a potentially impact on an ordered steel, which means if they are genuinely mania backshoring steel, that's going to be a  really great opportunity for them. But I'm confused because it says manufacturing and fabrication of the aluminum, et cetera, cetera.  And then the beginning of the sentence is powder coating, which is not manufacturing. So we also need to make sure that you're doing into that understanding exactly what it is when you go into this business.

29:21 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah, see right here, 60% of what I'm going to do, 20% iron is zero, 20% of the painting. So the painting is just like something on the side they probably added recently.  So one of those those odd side jobs that they add. I'm pretty sure I just thought today there were aluminum tariffs implemented today, I think actually, but I'll to double check on that.

29:41 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Cool. Why don't you do like look into all the tariffs that are happening and what impact that's going to have on businesses and then bring it to the team meeting.

29:55 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah, I'll have that ready for Friday.

29:57 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Cool. Awesome. And then there are things that you can set up like Google alerts. So it might be worth having a Google alert set up for one or all of you Ryan, I'll let you decide how we do this, but how are we keeping the team informed legislation, etc.  Because the bigger that we get, the more that we need to make sure that we're ahead of that and advising clients, so that we're not putting them in a situation that could be a, you know, or they're like, hey, I heard this and we're like, we don't know, like, we're, they're hiring us because we're supposed to be advising them on business opportunities, so we need to make sure that we have a full picture in context to be able to advise them from.  Yeah. Cool. There's a lot of riveting stuff happening right now. I'm very excited for the state of businesses over the next couple years.  I wasn't ever interested in politics, but like the, did you watch the congressional address?

31:00 - David R
  I asked Brian or Ryan, I didn't call you Brian. Sorry, Ryan. I watched it the night that we talked about it right now.

31:06 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So wasn't it so riveting? I like literally didn't pause it.

31:10 - AcquiMatch Team
  Yeah, it's exciting for, you know, our country to be taking action on stuff. know, it's like, um, sometimes you sit and wonder, like, what did you change?  Like, what actually happens? And sometimes it just feels like nothing gets down because there's just a bunch of red tape and stuff.  when you hear people will be like, we're doing it. Starting this day. We're doing that. Like, it's nice.

31:37 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, but also the context, like when you hear the full processes to why they're doing so, I've been watching all the executive orders and stuff and hearing and talk about things that it's phenomenal.  Like he has people from the press just in his office at all times. And he answers questions. It's just like, I don't think there's been a president that's been that open.  I'd be like, yeah, invite the press in and let them just like ask me anything. question. And he has an answer for everything.  I thought around it, it's a really interesting, it's just like, it feels like he's treating this like a business rather than what everybody else treats it as, which is like, let me just spin it or use a boxed phrase or make sure that everything is like rehearsed.  I mean, he's saying things over and over again, I still question his, you know, whether he's a good person or not, but as a businessman approaching like the country as a business.  It's really fascinating because it feels like a business turnaround. That's why I'm so fascinated with the whole thing. It's like, what?  The Social Security thing was like crazy. And then all the overspend and all of these different programs and stuff.  And the way the Democrats just sat their sour face the whole time didn't even like clap for the kid with cancer that got entered into the secret service.

32:53 - AcquiMatch Team
  Like, what? It's, yeah, it's the exciting time for a business, no, and we're just getting started because it's cool to like write for us for our business because we're kind of just getting started and all of a sudden there's someone saying this is how America is going to work for the next four years, right?  so it's, it's nice.

33:19 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, but also something for you all to be like there are or our clients have different political views, right?  some are very astutely Democrats, are very astutely Republican, which is fine. know, like everybody, that's, that's the beauty of America.  Everybody gets their opinion. But it is something that you're going to be working against if like either side, right?  So it's like, we know that and they start having concerns either from the left side or the right side, us having the full picture in context of what actually means.  So for example, Dustin and Lindsey are very pretty much left, right? And when I was going through the sales goals with them and they were like, what if Trump kicks out all of the migrants, you know, and I was like, well, it is unlikely that you're going to be able to get a business that has undocumented illegal workers in the first place.  So while that might not be a good thing for him to do, it won't affect you in terms of your acquisition.  But like, us knowing the policy changes and what's happening and stuff like that, like they're just hearing the little clips, they're probably not watching the whole thing or they're not watching, you know, they're not looking into the policy changes and reading that and that sort of thing.  So it's like, then we can advise from a place of like, I totally hear you. Here's how that can potentially impact you or here's what that actually looks like from a business perspective.  So, you know, and they're, they're concerns are valid. Everyone's concerns are valid. that's yet another one of those things that people can use to hold themselves back from making a decision, know, the fear that, you know, one  party or the other is going to ruin things and actually they didn't want to get started with me because they wanted to wait to see what happened with this administration and I talked about it.  I shouldn't laugh but you know it was like um so regardless of what each of us feel about the administration everybody's entitled to their opinions just like our clients are but if we have the understanding of like what's actually in legislation and how does this impact business or you then then we're delivering them a better service right and we can we can help them get over some of those fears or concerns one way or another.

35:36 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah I know I was thinking about that for DL with a manufacturing company they were going to be thinking about Trump and David and I have looked at deals before that imported a lot and we were talking about tariffs and so yeah.

35:47 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Well it's actually really cool what he's doing you know like I'm excited I don't want to give you the answer because I know you like looking into this but I think it's really cool and actually it's gonna level the playing field in a lot of  ways. So, um, be excited for you to back to all of us on your interpretation of what's actually happening with those.

36:08 - Luke Gillespie
  I knew it. Yeah, I'm following along. I know he said, oh, I didn't do it on April 1st, because people will think it wasn't jokes.  So I had to do it on April 2nd. Yeah, I just don't have those specific numbers. I forgot it's Mexico and Canada and China and retaliatory tariffs.

36:21 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  But yeah, I did have it's not retaliatory. There's a different R word for it. So when you do the research into it, you'll be able to like tell us like, why is he doing this?

36:31 - Luke Gillespie
  What is it going to look like? And then the likelihood that they're going to stay that way is going to be pretty minimal because of why he's doing it.  Yeah, exactly. That's a negotiation point.

36:44 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yep.

36:45 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah.

36:46 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  cool. Okay, so DL, there's a couple coming down the track, but it is we need a we need our perception shift with them.  need them to get their teeth sunk into something. Anyone else that hasn't had a teeth sinker in her?

37:10 - AcquiMatch Team
  It's peeing.

37:12 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Right. Okay. But it sounds like there's a lot of new deals coming through from them.

37:20 - AcquiMatch Team
  Well, there is low. We're working on right now. So yeah, that's right. We do have some new deals. We haven't confirmed if they're calling yet.  That's what we got to know. But yeah, we need to go remote with S.P. If there's nothing there, we need go remote businesses because they're open to remote.  They like remote. So if there's nothing here, like tomorrow, essentially, when you go directly to remote.

37:48 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Well, and how's it been working deal flow? know. You know, how to bring back.

37:57 - AcquiMatch Team
  She said it was good. She was a process processing. You know, now the David went through and did, you know, labeling of high, low prioritization.  she said that that's worked well for her right now. So that's working for us. We're getting better at that daily, right now, at least she's able to identify high priority deals and move those in like a priority fashion.

38:21 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Did she get, did she get caught up on the 200 or so that we're in there? Are we at the point that she's able to process daily yet?

38:29 - AcquiMatch Team
  She did not get through all of them. We talked about that today and we were like, yeah, you got to, you got to just keep going on all of them.  So there's a little bit of like a conversation. I need to have with her in terms of just understanding how to prioritize her work, like make sure she's getting to everything.  She had a lot of work, so she kind of was like, what should I do today? So I think there's a little bit more conversation we need to have for her.  around that she decided good understanding of what's important, what's not. But we're getting there, we're working that way.

39:07 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay, great. And Luke, how's that going for you just reviewing sims and doing write-ups every day?

39:12 - Luke Gillespie
  Good. Yeah.

39:15 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Can you say more?

39:17 - David R
  Yeah.

39:19 - Luke Gillespie
  helped Edo a little bit yesterday trying to see how I can improve, try to help her with her process.  Since I helped her out, I'll kind of fill out buyer profiles better and how to use a text so that it could help her send out all these mass emails.  And I also got more involved yesterday going into the pres and receive stage to help us get more sims because there's a lot of brokers that kind of need calls to get the sims.  So I've just been going back and calling brokers to get sims. deal flows looking a lot better this week.  I really do have a lot of promising deals. have like eight good leads right now I'm working on. It's just brokers aren't being very responsive right now.  So write-ups have been a little bit slow, but I've been doing the mental math in my head. Many days are left in the month.  We're not at any made a panic mode yet. So we should be good. I'm confident.

40:07 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay, cool. Um, so you're, you're still not in a space where you're just able to like process the deals every day.  It sounds like they're kind of helping. You know, I have enough time to process all the deals with them.

40:21 - Luke Gillespie
  If there aren't enough deals, I go back and start helping you.

40:26 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay, cool.

40:27 - Luke Gillespie
  Um, but again, I think that's, I just haven't been getting responses for lot of brokers. Normally I would be doing a lot more write ups and that takes up a lot more of my time.  So I would be doing a lot more write ups normally.

40:38 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  What do you think is going on there?

40:40 - Luke Gillespie
  I don't know. It's just this weekend, last week, a lot of these brokers aren't responding. Um, I'm, yeah, it's a little weird, but it's feeling a lot more normal this week than last week, like deal flow and good deals coming in with the prioritization system.  We'll work a lot better. I think last week was just a bad week because of the big backlog that was left over from the month before.  for? Yeah.

41:03 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Well, and is that working? just doing the deals with the con rather than this by its a priority right now?

41:09 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah, so far, I mean, not even halfway done through the month. Yeah. So if we're not anywhere, we're not close to minimums, the time for me will be like next week or around then, right?  So we're just trying out this new system so far. And I think it's going well.

41:24 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Well, like I said, I haven't gotten out that many new writeups yet. Yeah, well, there's going to be a knock on effect, right?  Because it sounds like Eda still has a backlog.

41:32 - Luke Gillespie
  So we need to process the backlog. Yeah, and we're getting to the point where every day David's processing, Eda's processing, you're processing or clearing every day is kind of where we're trying to get to.

41:43 - David R
  So sounds like we still have a little bit more work to do before we get there.

41:46 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Please don't do the meeting until you've done another week of trying to like get on top of this. Yeah, so okay.  Cool. How are you feeling overall about the clients? Ryan, in terms of like general satisfaction or anything, is that you need to be aware of?

42:13 - AcquiMatch Team
  I feel like she needs, I want to get her something, but also there's a bit of it that I just need to improve on my end of pushing her further, right?  He has a lot of time on his hands, so that's his thing, right? like we have to keep him in there, because he's just sitting on his computer looking at this all day long, so that's why I want to, you know, I feel little bit concerned about him just because  So, yeah, we talked about that. was trying to get some more deals. Looks like the homework assignment to make the 4.5 work.  Yeah, like I'm doing more of the modeling and thinking outside the box and thinking creatively. Okay. a good idea.  I'll do that.

43:27 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Because he's still, he's still shutting things down and telling you how things go instead of like kind of following.

43:34 - AcquiMatch Team
  So, yeah. Yeah. And so it's pretty much looking at it. It's pretty much just him. DL, which we are discussed and JSM.  And that's because he keeps tabs every two weeks on us. We're on the 11th, so we have a meeting today.  about he will be messaging us here in a few days and so let's beat him to the punch so that is uh we just don't have that many deals so um for Atlanta so Atlanta uh SP and JSN you kind of fall in that same bucket of deal flow um so we need to uh get something for him yeah i'll get him right on by Friday but again that's throwing us off of the just prioritizing good deals and focusing on the client but i guess we have to do that for Jason but i can get him right on by Friday did we advise him that it's changing the deal box that's gonna have an impact on his deal flow uh specifically saying like you're gonna get less deals um i was just like you know hey we're getting these ones because of  You don't find big ones, you said you're okay with smaller ones, you're sure you want to eliminate the smaller ones, you don't guess.
  ACTION ITEM: Message Jason re: deal flow changes, explain 1-2 week pipeline effect from deal box adjustments. Proactively update on team's daily focus. - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/250999093?timestamp=2703.9999  I've been updating now, I've said your message confirming. She said that he confirmed, but I didn't like specify what will be less deals though.

45:14 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  It's not less. It's going to have a knock on effect, right? I think Ryan sent him a message and say like, hey, Jason, we know you're probably going to check in with us about what's going on when you change your deal box.  It's about a one to two week pipeline for when we work deals. So when you eliminate a bunch of stuff that has a knock on effect, so we will we are very conscious of hitting our targets with you.  The team is working on it, but when you change your deal box and you've changed it on us a couple of times now, just know it has a little drag, but we're seeing some good things coming through.  But you don't need to chase us. We're on it, you know, like in your own way. But I think you need to explain to him when anybody makes a material change to the deal box.  Like, you think it takes us a week or two to. who work things. So it's like, when you change it, we're happy to make changes.  But if it's a material change, you just need to understand it's going to delay when we get our next deal to you, because the team that was working on things is going to have to completely recalibrate stuff.  So get ahead of him, point it out. We know that you're going to ask us. We are very aware of it.  We talk about you on a daily basis, but we're beholden to what comes through the market. So and when you change your deal box, it just has an impact.  So we're seeing some good stuff come through early. we're working it, we'll be we'll have something else over to you.  Don't wait for him to chase us on it. Like, you guys are talking about on a daily basis. Let him know that, you know, like almost overly update that you need to with clients like that.  Because he thinks that chasing us is what gets him the deals. You guys have now trained him that he needs to ask for it in order to get a deal.  So you need to get ahead of it and train him that we are on it and we are always looking.

47:00 - AcquiMatch Team
  And then asking you is not what gets him to deal.

47:06 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Because like that's why he's doing it now because he thinks he gets a response and he thinks that's how he gets deals.

47:15 - AcquiMatch Team
  Yeah.

47:18 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  And so yeah, Ryan, would send him an out like in your, your, your language, you always tone down my frustration in your own right.  I do it too when I actually speak to them. So I should be very clear, y'all like, you don't feel a lot of.

47:37 - AcquiMatch Team
  I prefer the unfiltered that, you know, and then I just figure it out.

47:40 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Right. But I don't want them think like that's how I would actually speak directly to clients. between us, I will be very direct and, and there's some frustrations.  And then when I actually speak to the client, it's like, Hey, Jason. No, you're probably thinking about this. And just so you know, the team are all on a daily basis being really concerned about making sure you get things but just so you know.  you know like it would be a much client-friendly version so Ryan knows it about me because he's been you know here for almost a year I think we're coming up on but I don't want you guys to think that that's how I would communicate directly with the client either so you see me enough on the calls but I air a little bit of frustration internally so I don't do that when I speak to them directly which is probably that's an area I can definitely improve on but Ryan's very good at filtering Athena out and just doing it in his own way and he doesn't get frustrated the way that I do so I don't I don't like them to feel like we're not working as hard like they don't get to see how hard you guys work and how much you care and how much you're thinking about that right so like it frustrates me that he thinks he needs to chase you all to do your job when you are it's just the way that it's been going with his deal flow and stuff so um  I get protective mama bear about that .

49:04 - AcquiMatch Team
  Yeah, no, that's a good idea. was thinking about that, right? Like we talked about today and I was thinking about how do we get ahead of this?  Um, and you had rather than just us give them a deal, just continuing to get in there and acknowledge where we are at and get ahead of it with just the messages is a good idea.  Um, so that's what all they do.

49:25 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  managing expectations, I think with DL to get ahead of it and just say like, Hey, no, it might feel a little bit slow, but it does take a while to warm up a new territory.  So there's a lot of things that can take some time, the off market, et cetera, et cetera. That's why we want you to like work these deals as far as possible, but just know the team is working very hard behind the scenes and you'll see that start to pick up momentum.  Um, you know, in the coming weeks as we get more ingratiated exactly into your community, you know, something like that.  We're, you know, because you have to remind him. It's a completely bespoke search. It's not like we were doing all this stuff before you came along.  It's like, we've turned this all on specifically for you. It takes a while to warm up. We would have liked to get them better deals earlier on, but every time we go into a new market with a new search, it's just like new things that we learned.  So work these deals to learn on things you don't really feel that excited about. So then when you get a deal like Andrew does, when you get a deal like Chris does, you've had enough of these conversations and these reps that you know what to do and you're ready for it.  But I just talk about the elephant in the room earlier and talk about why it's a benefit to them, the work these deals that they're not that emotionally attached to earlier on and that whole thing.  We know why our weaknesses are strengths for them, you know, so that it's just what I don't want is us just not talk about it.  And then they're like, God, I thought I was a man. be getting way more deals and this team isn't delivering it's like it's not the case y'all are working your butts off so don't do us a disservice by making them think that we're not.

51:12 - AcquiMatch Team
  Yeah that's something I need to work on like I have in my mind that we're always going to solve everything before that it comes um and I think just better communication with them and next setting better expectations goes a long way.

51:31 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  I have some space and goodwill too so like we always want to over deliver under promise over deliver you know right um I think we might get a new client who has worked with aquira um paid them double what they would pay us to get started you know and like I wish I wish I could share with everybody else like how bad he's like I maybe get a 15.  minute call every two weeks on a group call where it might get some questions answered, you know, and I was like, what are they doing over there?  And like, in a bad deal every other month, it's like not even profitable, but has a real estate attached to it.  So like, we do a really good job, but most of our clients don't have a point of reference for everything else.  So keeping them, their expectations managed, keeping them aware of like how the process is going and what's happening just buys the team some space, but also makes them feel like, okay, teams doing everything they can to make sure that I'm looked after.  Deal flow isn't an exact science, so we can just educate them on that too, right? off-market takes some time for that to warm up.  Then when those deals come along, you know, it's like you're going to sink your teeth into those more on-market same thing, like we're warming up, brokers start thinking of us, things come back online, you know, it's it's a machine that just turned on and it's  takes a little bit to get in there, so.

53:14 - AcquiMatch Team
  Yeah, yeah, I can um been thinking about some of the ways we have some of these conversations with them um like when I do the calls with them about businesses and stuff um I'm trying to get better at At the end of the call kind of addressing everything were working on and making sure I'm finalizing the call being like, all right You know where you're on this and that you know, Luke has been sending me messages being like, hey, I have these broker conversations I need to I close the loop on and I haven't been doing that.  So I've been trying to think about how I can like switch things up. Um, I think one way is like Maybe starting the calls with like, hey, where are we at all the  the things you're at that we've shown to you and just kind of try to close on close, get some closure on those, go to the next steps on those things and then also come and talk about, all right, here's the other thing we're looking at for you, so just to remind them that there's other things that we're doing, right?  It's just not when they get it right up, that's when we're working for them. Let's give them some insights.  Like, okay, we're looking to some of this and that, and that usually makes them feel pretty, feel pretty good.  Sorry, go ahead, I was interrupting your flops. can get better at like my calls with them to make sure they're all encompassing of everything that's going on.  Instead of, I've been very focused on what they want to talk about or what the biggest thing is, and I think I can make them more well-rounded.
  ACTION ITEM: Implement CRM review in client calls. Pull up CRM, notion, spot before calls. Discuss pipeline, eliminated deals, work done. - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/250999093?timestamp=3283.9999  So, yeah.

54:54 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  I would pull up their CRMs and any of the Those deals, they have an updated ask about it, ask about it, ask about it, right?  I don't think they're using it and it's because we're not pushing them to use it. So like eight gives us good insight in where it's at.  And also it helps you have a place to hold them accountable. It's like, Hey, this is your deal CRM.  You need to update it. Make notes, use it. Like what's going on here? What have you done with this?  If you followed up with the broker, like have you closed this out? So you have literally like a Canban board right there CRM with all their deals that you can like be Taskmaster on.

55:33 - AcquiMatch Team
  Exactly.

55:35 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  And make sure they're updating that. I don't know if any of them are updating it. Paul used to choose to be really good at putting notes in there and stuff.  So like even just like, have you updated this? you gotten into this? you looked at this? Like what's happening with this one?  That will feel like you're staying on top of them rather than vice versa or like whatever, you know? So I would I would get up there each other.  CRMs and go through that with them.

56:02 - AcquiMatch Team
  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. what I've been doing is like, we're going to talk about such and such So before the call, I map out time for me to prepare for a call.  And I go through the P&Ls, I get reactivated with the conversations, I look at their emails. And then I come and we just discuss that deal.  What I need to do is pull up the CRM, pull up the notion, right? Pull up also the other spot, you know, maybe even just take a look and see what we have in the pipeline to just throw some things at them that is going on, right?  We've pulled, you know, this many things for you this week, we're looking through those just to give them some insight, right?  Sometimes I'll like, shoot a message to Luke and be like, Hey, I'm getting on the call with Chris and now are they can you update me so I have some things to talk about?  But what I can do actually is just like, pull the notion, pull it up spot and have those talking points and things like that.

56:59 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  We have to do reports every month. I don't know. we're doing that anymore to just show them the sheer volume of stuff that we used to do.  Anka hasn't really had the bandwidth, so I'm pushing her, her P1 is going through the EA interview process right now to release herself from having to do that for me.  But that's something, the reason why I started that is because Lindsey and Kevin started, they were doing what Jason was doing to me, you know.  And so I was like, I need to show them, you know, and then they were like questioning, like, well, how come there was this many NDAs line, it was like, they didn't understand the process.

57:35 - Luke Gillespie
  So when they see the sheer volume of stuff that's specific to them, they're like, holy , you know. That would be really good, especially for clients like Jason, and especially clients like Gil, because maybe he'll realize, like, wow, if this is the one that they put in front of me and it has these problems, imagine how many problems the ones that they didn't put in front of me has.

57:57 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, maybe we need to look into doing that again. You know, I imagine maybe Akka couldn't do it because she didn't have bandwidth, but maybe that's the name that David could take on since he's owning the pipeline.  Anyway, like she can show him how to do it or some way that we can keep those numbers up to date.  I think it probably pulls through in the in HubSpot, what was not happening in HubSpot, though, was making sure people were changing the stages so that the numbers were getting accounted for.  But if everybody has their own little piece now of the pipeline, make sure those are updated and Ryan, you're staying on top of them to update the final parts, right?  how many analyze did we submit and that sort of thing. So we stopped putting the reports on their dashboard because I wasn't confident in the numbers because we just weren't tracking everything and sharing it accurately.  So we can start doing that again.

58:55 - AcquiMatch Team
  think, you know, that's in It sounds like a great idea, but I think this, what we're talking through about me doing it with him on the call, I think they're going to get a lot more out of that.  That's just myself, my interactions with them. Like when I talk with Joe, if I give him a few things that we're looking at, he feels good.  He's like, oh, know, and then he'll bring it up and I'll touch on it again. And I think he's more concerned with that on like a week-to-week basis and having the conversations with me, rather than looking at a report, because he gets to talk through it with me and it seems more real versus like a report that has a bunch of numbers at the end.  And those numbers won't always like fully represent how much work we did on that, right? Like if I tell him, oh, like for instance, like this one that Luke, we got to write it up out, the broker, hold the deal, why we're, why, why we introduced Jason to the broker, who it yet, we'll get you to the seller calling next week before the seller call he falls in, so if they're not listed.  Luke falls up, asks, what's going on here? The guy said he would have dropped by a million dollars, right?  Yeah. So this is just an example of something like, hey, we did this such and such, and then this is what happened.  And that's just one of other scenarios where we look at something and then look, we'll bring it to my time, say, hey, is going on, it's going on, let's not do it.  But it takes us time to get there. So I think I can do better at just having these conversations showing them the work that we're doing and some of these other things.  Okay, I see, right? Because the time and headache that we're saving them. Right, right, right. than just the number.  Ryan, can you even ask me before you have client calls, like to send you a couple of links of HubSpot deals where I'm looking at and you can just get a quick overview and tell them, oh, we're looking at this landscaping company for you in Colorado, right?  Right. Yeah, that's right.

1:00:52 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Well, so the reason why I didn't tell clients what deals were coming down the track is because I ran into problems with like even Eli.  where they would like, want more information or they'd start researching it or whatever, like, and then they got really bumped out when it didn't come through.  what Ryan just touched on is like, all the headache and  that we are saving them from, that would be kind of cool to like, be like, and here's the deal that we looked at.  because of this, we decided it wasn't good fit for you. Like, we eliminate more than we put in front of them, you know.  So if they understand or you explain all the work that went into saving them the headache of getting look at a deal that was not a good fit for them or was a nightmare or whatever, that might also buy some good will.  So they understand like the reason why they've hired us to save them time and keep crappy deals off their desk.

1:01:52 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah.

1:01:56 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So it's not just the deals we're looking at. It's like, what are all the ones that we invest in?  so time and energy into to make sure it was a good fit before we put it in front of them and determined it wasn't a good fit for good reason right but like even better it's like well on the listing it was this but you know when we dug into it further we found this and like that was a big red flag and we eliminated it for that reason.  Also are we responding when they send us all those links to listings that they're looking at are we responding to them all individually and giving them updates on it?

1:02:35 - Luke Gillespie
  Normally we do andrew we haven't because he books in so many links.

1:02:41 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay.

1:02:42 - Luke Gillespie
  What about all those off-market businesses that he sent? We inquired on it all.

1:02:47 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  We're moving on all of them. Great.

1:02:49 - AcquiMatch Team
  And I just reiterate that on the call. was saying we're working on them but there's so many I don't all those that you've you've done so and we've got them.  write-ups on some of those.

1:03:01 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Are we checking them before we work on that they're within the deal box?

1:03:08 - AcquiMatch Team
  Within the deal box?

1:03:12 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah, we check them and make sure they're not like an automatic pass but even if it's a number that's a little lower than what they're looking for or something but they say they're interested, we take that as a they're interested so we still work it.

1:03:25 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay so again here's an opportunity for us to be the thought leaders and the experts in this space. Eli used to  send me all sorts of crap all the time and like I would spend all my time running those down instead of looking at businesses that were a good fit and then I realized I was like he keeps sending me things that are outside of his deal box that we did not agree to right and so instead of running it down when I noticed like this is outside of the financial parameters or this is an industry he said he wasn't interested in or  Or this has this red flag that he wasn't happy with before. I will go back to him and be like, hey, like, or whoever the client is.  Your deal box says this. And I wouldn't have looked at this business because of this reason. So do you want to change your deal box?  Right. Because they're like, they're scrambling and they're like scarcity, scarcity. So now I'm going to start looking at things that I wasn't okay with before.  So it's like, we agreed this was outside of your deal box. That's why I'm not running this deal down.  That's why I wouldn't have looked it in the first place. Is this something you want to change about your deal box?  Is this something that you want to consider? Because then it makes them. This is outside of the deal box that you said.  But as this is making you consider something outside of your deal box.

1:04:53 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah.

1:04:55 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Because again, what we're doing is saving them time and eliminating things based on the deal bar. So they. So, if they're sending you guys things that they want you to look at that's outside of the dealbox, we should be pointing that out before we run it down.  We'll run it down, but we wouldn't have picked this up because of this reason or this is outside of what you said you wanted.  you sure? Do you want us to change your dealbox, right? I'm not saying that's what's happening on these deals, but it also saves you some headache and again, re-establishes why we are here and why we're doing what we're doing is because we're holding them accountable to the dealbox that they set and those parameters that they wanted to match.  So, if we're dropping our standards, we need to know about that because that might change how we look at things.  But it also puts it back on them to be like, oh, sorry, I was just looking at things and that whole thing.

1:05:51 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah, it's a good point. And I've done that before with Jason, he sent a deal, like I showed him how bad it was and he was like, never mind, not interested.  I wish we could do that with A H more is he sending like bad deals or is they sending deals We're not catching Andrew.  No decent ones, but it'll be like e-commerce ones, know, so There's so many e-commerce businesses out there Maybe he just saw the one product that caught his eye or he'll find something Sunday night when it was in our inbox Monday morning Like we've talked about yeah, because we weren't keeping him busy enough So this off-market shouldn't  work cut out for him cuz he's gonna have to create a whole sim investment Die can develop the relationship and how is it like can you you can go to Canada with a Driver's license, right like a real idea or do you have have the card?
  ACTION ITEM: Follow up w/ Andrew re: passport renewal, flight research for Canada trip. Emphasize urgency. - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/250999093?timestamp=3992.9999  You have to have the card not just passport book.

1:06:43 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah How do people not have their passports You can get one X by in like two weeks well, then he needs to get on that like he should be getting on a plane this week I had to go meet this guy Yeah, two weeks from college  Austin the deal, like he's got his homework. So Ryan, you need to taskmaster the  out of him and stay on him about that.  So he doesn't lose this opportunity, which again, buys the space, right? He's got a lot cut out for him now.  So he's not going to be scanning the listings. He shouldn't be at least like, and if he sends you more listings, be like, did you get your passport renewed?  Are you looking at flights? Are you researching like, you know, opportunities?
  ACTION ITEM: Call Bradley Pearson. Explain AA situation. Inquire about territories covered. Relay info to David re: Sun Belt region deals. - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/250999093?timestamp=4043.9999

1:07:26 - Luke Gillespie
  You can't get in Canada without a passport.

1:07:29 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  I just want to get on that immediately.

1:07:34 - Luke Gillespie
  That'll be tough. I didn't want to ask you something about Bradley Pearson and Minneapolis.

1:07:41 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah.

1:07:42 - Luke Gillespie
  So he always he sends us great deals for a right like amazing deal is the best connection is a shame is he's in AA's location.  And so the last one he sent us, he just sends a deal. he says, let me know if you're interested in all send an NDA, right?  And so I said, I said, okay, I'm It's great deal. Thank you so much for sending this over. But I have to, you know, our client in Minneapolis is dealing with some health problems.  So I'll sign you and take a look, but I won't be able to move very urgently on it because she's dealing with health problems.  Anyways, today, he just sent another amazing business in Minneapolis for A. And since that's your connection, if you know, wanted to ask you how you would like me to respond to that and what I should say to him.  Because either I tell him the truth and then our connection kind of just ends there and we don't get the deal flow anymore from Minneapolis.  Cause when I'm looking for a anyways, or I just keep leading him on and wasting his time, he's, he's taking the consideration to send me these amazing deals that I want to work on so bad.  He's, he would help me out so easy if we were working, if we were working AA, I could get to write it off her.  was so easy like this. But so I, I want your opinion on what you would like me to say to him.

1:08:48 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah. Well, I think Ryan of you updated them on AA. I can't remember if that was a group or you and me conversation.

1:08:58 - Luke Gillespie
  You didn't tell us the specifics, Ryan. said you got. has worked on a solution that we were going to be able to help her, but I don't know what it was.

1:09:04 - AcquiMatch Team
  Okay, got you. No, it was just that she's like not ready to move on business. So hopefully doing like weekly educational calls with her because she still does want to buy a business right now and all the time.  We're going to continue to work with her, get her prepped and build her up with the time she has left with us.  And then, you know, if she decides she wants to come back, she'll make out.

1:09:27 - Luke Gillespie
  Okay, so how about I'll give Bradley a call so I can talk to him over phone and then I not let him know health situation and once AA is back on, I'll notify him.  Hey, you can you send those deals over? starts sending those deals over again?

1:09:44 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, I think like call him up and be like, Hey, me, Ryan, I'll really appreciate you and you know, have loved interacting with you so far.  clients health issues have taken a turn where we don't think it's it's the right time for them. be looking at deals.  Um, so wanted to tell you we appreciate you and also like, uh, do you know all the territories that is offices cover?

1:10:10 - Luke Gillespie
  I know they cover like all across the country. I know that the Sun Belt is a certain region of America.

1:10:16 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  He's in a certain region. So I would like in that same breath be like, can you remind me what territories that you cover?  Because he's one of those like website closers where if you want any of the deals on his network, so you can relay that information to David.  So if you want any of the any of the deals in his network that are under Sun Belt, under certain territories, then you can go to him directly and he's gonna help us with that.  Um, so as we're adding new clients all the time, we want to make sure that we have an understanding of like those, those, uh, mega brokers, you know, like, um, Andrew from website closers or whoever, that you also have a list of all those territories.  So if David that doesn't have that for Bradley, then make sure that you relate that information to him. So you can, you can do a solid, I love calling him and maintaining that relationship.  It's just like, unfortunately, her health is not in a good place. And we don't want to, we don't want to move anything forward and waste your time.  But remind me what territories you cover, we're always adding new clients. So it might be that, you know, there's other things coming across for one of our other clients.

1:11:31 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah, sounds good. I'll do that.

1:11:33 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Great. That's a shame. like him a lot.

1:11:38 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah, he's so helpful. He sends us good deals all the time.

1:11:49 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  I'm just somebody newsletter this week is about the 2% that close, you know, and the different. I think it's going to feel a lot different.  It's just frustrating because I know we want to over deliver and get everybody their numbers. Ryan, that's your job to just kind of make sure you're managing people's expectations while we try to get this like easeful through pitch, through of deals in the meantime.

1:13:19 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah, cool campaigns.

1:13:25 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, Luke, you're off tomorrow, aren't you?

  Okay, cool. Well, I won't keep you all much longer. I'm excited. so excited about these off-market things. going to like when other people hear that, you know, it's just like the more of our clients that are working deals, the more it like gets them all excited.

1:13:59 - AcquiMatch Team

1:14:35 - David R
  Thank you.

1:14:37 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So just the new client, potential client, he's checking with his wife, but he was introduced by Nate, who was also somebody that used acquirer.  Nate goes to all of the search events and him and Justin regularly. So Nate was also a potential client and is sending potential clients our way.  So I'm sure he's getting feedback from Justin. was an active client on how things are going. But Justin was introduced through Kevin who closed on a business, and that gives us some goodwill.  But just so you know, you all don't necessarily see all the intertwining of the searcher circles, but I do.  So they all talk.

1:15:17 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah.

1:15:18 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Not that you don't put unnecessary pressure on yourselves already, but the better that we can do for these people that are definitely in these circles, the better overall for us too.  And I'm having a follow-up call with Will tomorrow, but it sounds like, rather than doing the Q and A's, he wants to offer me a webinar, which would be better for us anyway.

1:15:41 - Luke Gillespie
  So I'm very excited about that.

1:15:43 - AcquiMatch Team
  Well, yeah. Justin, you've got a great first write-up. We usually blow them away with a amount of information that they get, they usually are like, wow, and he was.  He was like, you know, he had two broke calls with Luke. He had a video from Luke. We had all these financials.  had the sim. We had our nose. I gave him my personal feeling on the Congress and why I thought this was actually a good one.  And so he was like, yeah, OK, was awesome. So he's good right now.

1:16:18 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Sweet, amazing, cool. Good work, y'all. I'll let you go. I know it's late. Thank you for all you do.  I'm excited. Percolating, it's happening. Good stuff. Awesome. right. See you, everybody. Thanks. Thank you. Bye.
