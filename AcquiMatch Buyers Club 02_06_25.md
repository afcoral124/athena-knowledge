# AcquiMatch Buyers Club 02/06/25

[00:00:00] 



**Athena:** Welcome. Welcome. Who else we got? Justin's here. Hey, Justin. Hello. Are you going to the meetup tonight? 

**Justin:** I will be there. 

**Athena:** Oh, cool. I'm chatting, 

**Justin:** so I'll 

**Athena:** see you there. 

**Justin:** I heard. Yeah, looking forward to it. 

**Athena:** You'll get to wave the coveted Austin spot that none of them are going to get. 

**Justin:** There you go. I'll boast it proudly.

**Athena:** Amazing. Cool. Uh, well, good to see you twice today. What an amazing opportunity that is. I think Joe might be logging into somewhere. 

**Andrew:** Hey, if any edges on sorry, I can't be on video at the moment. 

**Athena:** No worries. All good. We know you're a road warrior. How are you doing? 

**Joe:** All right. Running hot. 

**Athena:** Cool. Um, well, awesome.

So, uh, occasionally we have, um, you know, usually once a week we have an opportunity to just kind of talk through stuff amongst [00:01:00] ourselves. And it's an opportunity for you all to, you know, it's kind of an ask me anything. Uh, we've got the whole team here. Um, if you have any specific questions about deals or challenges that you're having, or even just, you know, Mindset challenges or things that you're feeling as you go through this and talking around it.

So it's, it's, you know, what happens in buyers club stays and buyers club. So we're able to talk about deals, but often there's a lot of other stuff that comes up. So I had some points. I wanted to chat through that. We're just seeing thematically. That might be helpful. But since we have the time, if if there's anything that anybody.

I'd like to talk through in particular, because we do have that opportunity. Now,

give you some time to think about it. Maybe put your hand up if you feel like you want to chat through it or deals that are coming up tactics strategies, that sort of thing. Um, and then I can, I can take the mic for a minute. Oh, sorry. Was that you Joe? [00:02:00] 

**Joe:** Yeah. Hey, I'll go if no one else is raising a hand and I couldn't hit the button.

Yeah. Yeah. Please do. I have my call. Uh, kind of a second follow up call with Ryan on the AC 

**Andrew:** company that I have an LOI in for, um, and just kind of a 

**Joe:** conversation around the seller's counteroffer. Um, I guess I'm 

**Andrew:** not struggling with, but 

**Joe:** I, you know, sometimes when a deal, um, it starts to upgrade, I think I talked about it on the call, kind of a unicorn deal, numbers look better than I expected, and now it's just kind of, Averaged out, uh, you know, it's still a good deal as I'm talking through with Ryan, but in the negotiation, I want to make sure that I feel like I'm getting wins on it too.

Um, you know, and some of the counter points from the seller were pretty strong and I feel like he's digging in really well. And the most important [00:03:00] thing is his asking price. So, um, more, I don't know if it's necessarily a question as opposed to just, you said mindset and trying to stay out of the emotional part.

And my amygdala, right? I think they bring that up and uh, never split the difference. Yes. I'm familiar with that. But um, It's probably just working through the negotiation aspect and making sure I feel like I still I think i'm getting a good a win and so is the seller and that's where I think they talk is a fair deal for everyone 

**Athena:** Yeah, um, it's really good to bring this up, Joe, because, um, it's, it's something that we'd all like to think that we're not going to get into the amygdala part of our brain as we go through this, but it's, it's almost unavoidable and everybody does it in different ways and looks at things in different ways.

And it's, it's a. You know, kind of a protective mechanism, but also, like, things can just feel personal when it's like, you're looking at putting a personal guarantee on the [00:04:00] line and changing your entire life. Um, it's personal for them, because it's been their livelihood for a really long time. Uh, and in your particular situation, uh, are you okay if I just kind of give some context to the other folks about about what you're looking at?

**Joe:** Yeah, sure. Let me know if you need me to fill in anything. 

**Athena:** Yeah, so, uh, Joe is, um, pretty geo constrained with his search. He is, you know, kind of looking within 45 minutes of his house. Um, and we have an off market, uh, HVAC opportunity. Um, has been consistently growing revenue over the last 3 years, has been in existence for about 20 years.

Sellers just ready to retire, um, from the feedback I'm getting from Joe and Ryan, uh, Joe and the seller have similar, you know, kind of temperaments and are straight shooters, um, but because it's off market, seller doesn't have anyone in their corner kind of [00:05:00] advising them. So when we have those off market opportunities, we're kind of.

Getting the seller to a point and doing some education along the way, but if they don't have a, you know, lawyer or broker on their corner, then they're kind of learning as they go to, um, and what can feel like, you know, negotiations are. One of the hardest parts about this process, because we'd like to think it's like, you know, we don't haggle when we go to the grocery store, you know, it's not culturally like, we just don't do that very often.

It's just like, the price is the price and that's the price. And it's like, I'm putting a price out there and I want you to accept it. Or you initially set a price and that should be what it is, but ask people get more information. And as we go through this process, then we're going to end up. Negotiating on things, and it can feel sometimes very personal.

It can feel like somebody is trying to get 1 over on us. But really, it's just people trying to, you [00:06:00] know, navigate their way through something, which is it's it's the 1st time. Both of you are going through this. You as the buyer and him as the seller. So, I think, you know. If you're, you seem to be asking for a reframe and I'll, I'll, I'll, you know, give you some, some thoughts just from contextually where you're sitting at to have, you know, such a limited geography as, you know, it makes some constraints on kind of the deal flow.

And, uh, I believe you have some familiarity with this industry and it's got all of those markings that make it like a strong. Business to buy it. Like, there hasn't been variability in revenue. There is no working capital really necessary because he gets paid as soon as he delivers the job. Um, you're in Florida.

So, like, there is never going to be a time that we don't need HVAC services out there and AC services like that demand is there and your [00:07:00] skills. On sales and being able to, like, apply that to this business means that, you know, it's already performing well and your unique ability to be able to, like, drive more revenue, because it sounds like that's not necessarily a seller skill set, um, gives you a fantastic opportunity now, if we zoom out even further.

One of the hottest industries right now for acquisition is HVAC, like people are going absolutely crazy for it. Private equity is coming down lower and lower to try to buy up more of these. Um, and even at the level that you're at. So the fact that you have an off market opportunity with no competition, and I believe based on what Ryan told me, the latest kind of place that you're at is looking at a 3.

5 multiple. You still have an exceptional deal for this kind of business with all of those characteristics. When we're seeing like HVAC trading at four or five X [00:08:00] even higher and you being up against strategic buyers that are showing up with all cash. So all of those variables considered. Even if it is not, you know, the price, yes, it was a little bit lower initially.

And then the seller sounds like they got some information and understand understood that their, their business is worth a little bit more. But if they actually went out to a broker, or if we were to put this on market, we'd get hundreds of inquiries. Admittedly, all cash buyers, probably offering like 5 X.

So you still do have a really amazing opportunity in front of you. And the fact that there's no other competition, it ticks all of your other boxes. Um, it's not abnormal to be negotiating the price and talking about the price, and you're going to talk about the price even after you go under offer, you're going to have to talk about it.

Multiple times over because either things are going to change in due diligence where there's, there's more money there, [00:09:00] or they might start growing exceptionally while you're doing it, or you find things that you need to pull the purchase price down. So, it's normal to have to, you know, have that discussion multiple times at multiple points during this process.

Um, so a reframe of. I have something that, like, everyone wants right now, and nobody else knows about it, and it's got all the variables that I was looking for in a business, and it's still, like, at a reasonable asking price, and if I apply my skills to it, I could probably be. Really enhance this business and even if you get in there for a couple years and you don't like it, you can still sell it at a much higher multiple to private equity who's still going to be buying up these types of things, you know?

So like, not only do you have an exceptional opportunity yourself to be able to buy a hold and have something amazing, but if you end up getting in there and you don't like it, you're still going to be able to probably like, you know, make more money, which isn't something I normally tell y'all [00:10:00] to do. But because this is such a industry that is.

Is highly sought after. There's options for you. Um, so how's that all landing so far, Joe?

**Joe:** Um, good, you know, about what I expected and just general advisement. I don't think there's any very specific solution other than going through the process. Right. And, uh, my next action at this point, I'm going to try to get in front of the seller. If he can't meet by tomorrow afternoon. Uh, when I happen to be over in the area, um, I'll try to do something by early next week and I think being in front of him.

Making it more personal between the two of us before, you know, rather than just all the responses being in writing and on email. 

**Athena:** Yeah, they're 

**Joe:** going your way and, uh, hashing some of [00:11:00] these things out. Absolutely. You're 

**Athena:** so good at conversations in a report building and like, hearing him out and hearing his concerns and I think you can even be honest about it and be like, hey, I'm feeling a little, you know, upset that you originally said this and now you're saying this, like, talk me through.

You know, how you arrived at that decision or why you feel, you know, that happened and then maybe you'll get some insight into what information that he got and be like, okay, that's fair, you know, um, but the, the other thing to ask yourself, you know, if, if you take away the price. Like, how do you feel about this business?

Are you excited about it? Does it, do you see yourself in it? Is it something that you're excited to be able to like take the reins of and and buy?

**Joe:** Um, yeah, if I take away the price, yeah, I've had enough kind of visuals. [00:12:00] Around it and kind of put myself in there that I still see it as positive that way. There was no price involved. Yeah. 

**Athena:** So then then it's like, okay, have a conversation with them, you know, talk through your points. I'd revisit everything and never split the difference and, you know, see, see if there's some wiggle room there or maybe there's some variables that you can put in after the fact.

Like, hey, what if I paid you? A salary or something, you know, so, like, maybe it's not all in purchase price. Um, there's other little things that you can maybe talk about with him, or you just like, I really like this business. I really like him. I think applying my skill set to this business. You know, I'm going to be really happy that I got it at what it is because I know down the line and, you know, I'm going to have a really clear, amazing exit opportunity myself.

And I mean, even so, Joe, knowing what I do about you, even even the name, I'm [00:13:00] like, knowing how you feel about ice. I'm like, I could see you like, creating your little ice club, like, alongside. Side your like whiskey ice club alongside this brand and everything. It just feels like you, so the price, you know, you're at the LOI stage and you can agree the price and it's like, well, everything, if everything is the way it says it is, and it's still a, you know.

Good price for a good business that doesn't have a lot of like, there's no volatility hasn't like, gone like this in his numbers and it looks pretty solid. So that gives you a lot of like, confidence there. And it's just going up and up. Um, but when you get into due diligence. You might discover stuff that like, okay, the numbers change or insurance is going to end up changing or, you know, some of the ad backs that he added in, like, the QV comes back and says, it's not okay.

Or the bank says, Hey, we're not okay with this. You'll have other opportunities for other people to look at it. [00:14:00] Once you go under offer. And see if that price still makes sense for you. So you will have the opportunity again to gut check it with multiple people that know what they're doing and have a conversation about adjusting it after LOI, if you need to.

So I think that's hard for people with high integrity. That's like, you know, if I say a price, I'm going to stick to a price to wrap their heads around, but it is normal after you go under LOI that you might have to make some adjustments to that too.

**Joe:** Right. And I've thought of that. Um, and that's what kind of softens, I've been thinking about that over the past couple days. It softens my stance on, yeah, there'll be other opportunities to right size things or tweak it as needed. Regarding the ice thing, I didn't think of that, but don't give away all my secrets either.

Okay. 

**Athena:** I was trying to lightly say it, but I was like, when [00:15:00] Ryan and Luke were telling me, I was like, Oh my God, this is like for him. And, you know, we were like, how can we get something involved with ice? It's like. Like, I just see, you know, like your community event or club or whatever, you know, like, I love it.

I love it for you. And, um, yeah, the, the, you know, uh, I think you were on with, um, Kevin the other day, but like, Lindsay and Kevin went through this with both of their sellers where they initially agreed something and then. As they went through the process, because they were also focused on building a really good relationship with the seller that by the time it got to the point where they had to renegotiate the price or some of the points or add in some protective notes or that sort of thing, it was a much easier conversation.

So you're still kind of early. In the relationship phase, but if you focus on once you get under offer, like really getting to know him, getting a good relationship with him, showing him the integrity that you have that you're operating from a place of wanting to do right by him [00:16:00] and yourself, you know, so he trusts you that when you do have to have that conversation or when you do want to have that conversation, it goes a lot further than it might now, where you're still kind of getting to know each other and feeling each other out.

**Joe:** Yep. Yeah, I can appreciate that. So, um,

yeah, so that's, I guess where we're at and I'll let you guys know, um, when and how we're meeting up. 

**Athena:** It's exciting. You're like, you're there, you know, like this is, this is exciting and, you know, like getting, getting to have these conversations and these negotiations and finding something, you know, that feels like a really good fit, you know, the price.

We can, you can account for that and you can look at other ways to, as long as it's not, you know, all the, the debt service looks like it's [00:17:00] still going to be good at that, that number. But like I said, when, when you get under the hood a little bit more and start getting into due diligence and get a better relationship with him.

And like, we recommend all of you, like, when you get under, I start having a weekly meeting with the seller and do it in person if you can and, and, you know, just set up a. Okay. Um, you know, there's a whole bunch of people you know, standing coffee date, same time, go and meet them every week. Talk through things, how it's going.

By the time you get to the point. It's like you've come back or the banks come back and it's like, hey, um, you know, they came back and here's what we're working with. We're gonna have to make some adjustments, but they know you, they trust you. They like you. They want you to buy their business, so they're more willing to help find a solution.

They're still

there. Joe?

Yes, 

**Joe:** [00:18:00] I am. I didn't, I don't know if I didn't hear. Question there. And, um, yeah, but, uh, regularity on it and meet in person. I agree. 

**Athena:** Yeah, 

**Joe:** and as things unfold through due diligence, it makes sense. And that's where it's probably a lot easier on the conversations as things unfold those conversations and kind of, I guess, live and negotiate 

**Athena:** and they're more pot invested at that point.

Right? Like, the further down the track you get in the relationship, the more they're invested in seeing this through. So, you know, you're still in the, the courting phase, you know, they haven't accepted the proposal yet. So once, once you're engaged and it's like, well, now you're going to start wedding planning and it's like, well, I want to, I want the wedding to happen.

So it's like the, the conversations that are harder now are a little bit easier as you, you, you know, they see the finish line and they start to see like what their future is like. And also, you know, tap into your sales stuff. Like when you talk to him, like, what are you going to do after? Like, [00:19:00] what's the plan?

Like, how are you going to spend the money? Like, what are you going to go and do, you know, like get him excited about what this means for him. 

**Joe:** Right. 

**Athena:** Um, cool. I think I appreciate that. Yeah. And I love that you're open to thinking that way. Um, you know, just a general theme that I wanted to touch on actually, um, because we're seeing it across a couple of clients and also I'm seeing it like outside of.

So, um, I'm a little bit woo sometimes, and sometimes there's just like energy or themes or messages. And when I see it in multiple places, I'm like, okay, this is something worth pulling out and talking about, um, but you, you talking about that reminded me, Joe, that, uh, you know, there's an element of oftentimes we can have, like, gotten burned in the past or have a distrust of people or trying to protect ourselves [00:20:00] and, and I think a lot of you, you know, Want to make sure that you get this right, that you don't miss something that you don't end up getting into something where, you know, it was a bad deal.

And we hear all of us hear these horror stories about bad deals. And, you know, those things tend to get a lot more attention though, but it's, it's very rare. So. Something that I started implementing in my own life a few years ago, because I was pretty hard nosed. I'm an ex Brody. That's why all the music stuff is behind me, you know, so I, like, it was just like raw, like, I'm ready and I had to, like, get, you know, 20 year, uh, like.

Uh, what is it? Um, the stagehands that were part of the unions to take me seriously when I was a young, like, stage manager trying to tell these, like, guys that have been doing it for 20, 30 years what to do. So, I was, like, a very hard hitting person and I got burned a lot of times and I had a bunch of people, you know, screw me over.

[00:21:00] Like, I perceived that they screwed me over and I would operate from that place that I was always trying to, like, catch people out or protect myself or not let someone screw me over, you know. Assuming that people were lying to me all the time, and I made a very deliberate mindset shift to stop doing that and operate from a place of giving people the benefit of the doubt.

So most of these sellers, like the more sellers that you meet. The more we realize, like, they are just trying to figure this out too, and 99 percent of them are, they have a lot of integrity, you turn up on their doorstep and they'll just like open the curtain, tell you absolutely everything. They care about their communities, they care about their employees, they care about their customers.

There are a few bad ones out there that give a bad name to everybody, but I do this. In business situations, I do it in personal situations. Like I always operate now from the place of I'm going to give [00:22:00] everyone the benefit of the doubt. I'm going to trust them. I'm going to trust that they're operating from a place of integrity that they are a trustworthy person until they give me a reason.

Not to so my team's seen this right? Like, I give all the brokers the benefit of the doubt. We know how hard it is for them. They're getting 200 inquiries a day on their listings, right? And they don't have CRM's and texts and on goes and Ryan's and Luke's to help. They're on their own trying to navigate all this.

It's a lot. It's overwhelming. Um, you know, and now we have a lot more of this, like, private equity, um, Process coming into small business land, so they haven't had the kind of scrutiny that they, they, you know, they're not used to all that. So, for the most part, I'm always like, okay, I don't think the broker or the owners are trying to screw anyone over.

I'm going to start with that as my mindset. I'm going to operate from a place of they're not trying to hide anything. There's no fraud. They're just here trying to sell their business [00:23:00] and do the best they can with the ability that they have until they give me a reason not to. So, there's been some brokers that have said things that I fundamentally, I'm like, you were a bad person and you don't know it yet, but you've crossed me and you're going to realize too late that you shouldn't have done that.

So, you know, that only happens when they do something that I'm just like, that is totally unacceptable. We're not going to do business with this person anymore. And that's it. Um, but it's. 1 or 2 out of the hundreds that we deal with on a regular basis. And when you have us by your side, when you're looking at these deals, if you're looking at it from a place of, okay, I'm going to operate from a place of, I'm going to give them a benefit of the doubt, assume that they're doing.

You know, the right thing, and then also, if the team are saying, like, no, this is normal, or this [00:24:00] variability is okay, or at this stage, I wouldn't be concerned about this. We'll be able to catch it out later. Then operate, you know, from a place of benefit of the doubt, the only point that it really gets real for you.

Like, the real risk is when you start spending money on deal team. And even then, if you're choosing the right deal team to support you through this process, they'll catch things that will likely save you, you know. Millions of dollars of bankruptcies down the line. So as we go through every step, there's no risk to you to have the conversation.

There's there's even no risk in the L. O. I. If you're using the template and it's non binding, right? So, um, you don't have to buy the business. If you submit an L. O. I. And you change your mind down the line. You don't have to, you know, go with a bank, even if you get a term sheet, if you don't sign the commitment letter.

So there's. Yeah. A lot of steps before we get to the point where it really gets real. Um, but [00:25:00] I bring that a lot because I'm seeing it even in my personal life and people, they're like, you know, job hunters right now. And they're just like, companies are out to screw you over and. They don't put salary requirements on their job listings and they're just trying to like nickel and dime you and I was like, well, actually, we don't put salary requirements on because like we, if we did, we'd miss opportunities and people that we hadn't even thought of before, you know, like, that's why we don't like, it's actually a positive reason why we don't do it, you know, so like, what if you assumed that they're operating from like, The positive place or that they didn't give you information because they didn't know it was important or something that they did with their books was just because they were busy running their business and keeping track of your books and doing all the taxes and stuff is a lot of work.

So I'll stop ranting there, but I guess the whole theme is and a reframe when you start to feel yourself being like, are they lying to me? Is there something here? I'm not seeing. [00:26:00] Are they trying to screw me over? Is this a bad deal to like, tell yourself, like, what if I were to give them a benefit of the doubt?

What if I were to look at this through the lens of they're not trying to do anything like that to me? Then your interaction with them, the energy that you give to it and the way that you look at things completely changes because if we're operating from a place of fear or not wanting to get caught out or defensiveness or anger, then we see it through that lens and it's very hard for you to see the opportunity.

When we're operating from that amygdala place, right? That Joe was talking about. So the reframing is, is a really powerful mental exercise and it's, it's proven. There's a lot of, you know, experiments on it, but flipping from a closed mindset to growth mindset is merely asking yourself. What if I looked at this through the lens of, like, They're not trying to do anything to me or what if I were to look at this through the lens of how would I make [00:27:00] this work?

How can I make this work? It's really powerful. And you end up seeing opportunities and you end up seeing solutions and you end up having better interactions with people as a result of that. So I'll leave it there. Anybody have any thoughts or. Challenges or questions about that. Oh, Andrew, it looks like you just made a comment.

Do you want to unmute and actually say that sounds like a good point? 

**Andrew:** Well, I wish I wouldn't didn't have to get on here read it because it's kind of it sounds really frou frou when you read it out loud, but I'm 

**Athena:** down with a bit of woo and frou frou. I love it. Let's go. 

**Andrew:** I mean, I think about this all the time.

And it's even like the interaction with a grumpy barista, you know, you don't know what happened to their, you know, Not in their day to day. So what if you looked at the world as if everyone is doing the best they can in that very moment and that all you're suffering is in your judgment of them. Um, and that's kind of messes with your brain a little bit.

If you think about that [00:28:00] too long, but I need that reset all the time. I can get pretty grumpy if someone's driving ahead of me and get some road rage. I don't know what's happening in their world. Maybe they're driving slow because their, their grandmother's in there and they're transporting him to the back to the nursing home.

You don't know. You just don't know. So. Yeah. All your suffering is generally in your, in your judgment of them. So try to remove that. 

**Athena:** It's a, it's a big energy drain too. I was talking, um, With my boyfriend about this the other day, because we're, we're, we, we compliment each other. I'm always like the optimist.

Right. And like, if to me, when I, I was traveling through the airport the other day, I was in such a bad mood and I was like, okay, I can go and be grumpy with every single person, but I know my bag's probably like a pound overweight and there's long lines. And I, if I am like, over index on the happiness and just be like, how's your day?

You know, and like, guess what happened? I didn't get charged for my bag. This guy like cut me through the [00:29:00] line, like got smiles from people. And what happened is my low mood ended up getting much better. I've been put on like a cute outfit so ladies were like complimenting me on my outfit and stuff and it's just like when I'm feeling crappy if I force myself into that positive energy, then the interactions I get with people actually lift my mood and give me more energy opposed to putting negative like if we're in a negative mood and we're acting like that and putting that out, then it ends up like draining your energy more.

It reinforces your negative mood, you know, so like the road rage thing like driving in I don't know what it's like where you are andrew but in texas like it is Wild west here. It's awful. Like people are just constantly like Riding your ass and like have their brights on all the time Like why does everybody drive with their brights?

We're in the city. There's lights everywhere. Like what are you doing? you know, but Um, I got so mad for a while when I was first here and it was just like raising my like pressure [00:30:00] and and like you said you don't know what's going on like They might have someone in the hospital or whatever, and they need to get to it or, but it just, it drains your energy to actually makes your life worse to get upset about all that stuff.

**Andrew:** Now, I think my, the reason my mentor told me that I was making a lot of cold calls at that time, and you don't, you don't know what you're going to get on the end of that phone call. And you can't, you don't know what's happening in their world. You're interrupting their world. Um, so anyways, 

**Athena:** cold calling is not for the faint of heart either.

So like, it's probably one of the least liked things on the other end of it. Right? Like you're almost guaranteed to get people like not happy with you. How did you turn them around? 

**Andrew:** Oh, on these? Well, just probably similar to you, less cute outfits, more just me being really emotive [00:31:00] and just killing with kindness.

**Athena:** Yeah, it doesn't cost you anything to be kind. Um, back in London, like my, um, friends, grandma was like, kindness costs you nothing, you know, but when you, when you're kind to people and when you like, don't let their bad moods phase you, then they start feeling bad and they feel like they need to reciprocate with kindness too.

So that's another great way to like, overcome that. 

**Andrew:** I don't know if you guys, if you looked into that stuff, but thought pattern interrupts, like, you know, I think they talk about it and never split the difference. If I didn't something personally to offend you or wait, who are we mad at again? You know, or what just literally just stopping and changing their train of thought that worked a lot.

Also works with my toddlers.

**Athena:** You kind of just at the beginning, what was that? You said thought pattern interrupts. 

**Andrew:** Yeah, thought pattern interrupt interrupt their train of thought with something with a question. [00:32:00] Because whoever it's asking the question runs the conversation. So, if I can, um, have a thought pattern interrupted in there to get them out of that angry.

Why are they angry? Man, what are we mad about? You know, 

**Athena:** good for children. Also, probably brokers and agitated owners. I imagine

awesome. Great points. Thanks for, uh, bringing that up. Andrew. I think that's good. Awesome. Any other thoughts, questions, challenges that we're having? We can totally switch topics too. I know I've been like, kind of rain in the woo on you. So, uh, but it. You know, I wish you all could have seen me 10 years ago when I was really unhappy and not taking care of myself and just absolutely miserable and, you know, just having really crunchy interactions with people because I was like, such a hard nose, like, you know, and, and just flipping that has just completely changed my life, my [00:33:00] energy, my interactions, and I end up getting such better results out of everyone in my life and kind of bringing that around.

So I wanted to call that out because I, I know how scary this process is. You know, it's, it's something that has so much risk to actually like put your livelihood, your family's livelihood, put a personal guarantee, you know, step into something unknown. There's, there's a lot, y'all are brave to be here and be looking at this and there's a lot of fear.

That's involved with that, but, you know, some fear can end up holding you back in the process. And we've seen that, um, you know, we've worked with enough of you that we see, like, each of you have a little pattern in terms of how you protect yourself when, when the fear comes up and, you know, we try to make you aware of that so that you can get out of your own way because it's normal.

It's natural. It's absolutely expected that you would get afraid at some point and want to do [00:34:00] something to kind of. Okay. Protect yourself in this process. You don't make the wrong decision. Um, but sometimes those fears or thought patterns or expectations, right? Like the expectation. Someone's going to screw us over.

It's like, we might then interact with people in a way that they're like, screw this person. They don't trust me. And, you know, I don't like interacting with them or whatever. It's, it's amazing how if we're thinking things, there's a, Okay. Um, I've never confirmed how to pronounce this quote, you know, that our thoughts become our words, our words become, um, our actions, our actions become our character and our character becomes our destiny.

So, like, it all all starting with how we're kind of, like, analyzing the world through the frame that we're thinking about things.

I've silenced you all. Cool.[00:35:00] 

**Joe:** For what it's worth, I'm just going to echo that your, uh, your vivacious personality is, uh, is echoed and shared by others. The, uh, when I just talked with Wendy at Live Oak, she recounted a story about you having vegan tacos on the floor with her and how excited she was to feed off your energy. And she just had nothing but praise.

So there you go. Yeah. Whatever you're doing, others are recognizing it. 

**Athena:** But, you know, I guess, I guess it's not to, like, brag or anything, it's just like, I didn't, I wasn't always this way, but you get really great reactions, and people, people want to be around good energy, they want to be around good interactions, you know, so like, if you're, if you, and let me, let me, I had so many conversations with sellers that I was like, Hey, you Like, the 1st conversation they'd have with buyers and buyers would just be coming with their list of all the things.

And they're like, what happened here? And why did revenue drop? And they're like, this is the 1st conversation. [00:36:00] Like, who are you? You know, and it was just, it's, it's terrifying for them. They're just being interrogated by people that, like, don't trust them. Right. And are trying to catch them out and find all those things.

So, you know, it's something that that. Yeah. Me and the team all do when we're talking to sellers and we're talking to brokers, it's like operating from that place of trust and curiosity and exploring those things and getting to know them and building that relationship with them. And then you end up getting so much further and the seller is like, well, God, I got interrogated and could feel that, like, all these buyers did not trust me.

And then there was, there was that guy, Justin, who genuinely was trying to get to know me. Had nice things to say. Didn't make me feel like he was interrogating me and, and, you know, asking me about things in my numbers that I don't know, the broker put it together. You know, it's just like, and then guess which one they want to continue talking to, right?

So like. This stuff actually [00:37:00] works because you've been on the receiving end of somebody that didn't trust you and was asking you a bunch of questions and you didn't necessarily know the answer. And it's like, why don't you trust me? Like, I'm I'm a trustable person. I haven't done anything wrong. So, like, when you flip the script and think about being on the receiving end of that, like, crappy energy, like, and then think about the sellers that.

You know, on market, like, they might be speaking to dozens of potential buyers, and a lot of them aren't considering how they feel and that feels crappy.

Um, anyone want to talk through deals or challenges that they're having or build on that? Um, you know, how's everybody getting on? I know quite a few people are circling offers right now, getting into the kind of pre L. O. I. This is a conversation about negotiation phase. Like how that, how's that feeling?

Um, any specific, you know, deal stuff. Challenges. Anything we can help with while we're here. We got a few more minutes.[00:38:00] 

Silence again. I'm doing awesome today. 

**Joe:** Say, if I had something, I'd be talking up, but I'm still early, so nothing. 

**Athena:** We're close, Justin. Justin will be starting a search soon. Awesome. Okay. So just some things to be aware of coming up. Um, next Thursday, we're going to have Chris from Midwest CPA coming back. Um, he's actually going to take you on a tour of a QAV report so you can actually see inside, see what it looks like.

So I know he like, and if you weren't on the call that he originally did. Go back and watch that 1 on the, um, platform. Maybe you can pull the link and just remind people before next week to watch that. So Chris kind of talks about just general concepts about a QV report, you know, the [00:39:00] financial due diligence part, what you can be doing at different stages.

Stages throughout the process to do some financial due diligence on your own before you get to the QV. Um, and then general concepts that you wanna think about when you're looking at the finances and doing due diligence. So would highly recommend y'all watch that first before you join next Thursday, because we're gonna be building on that.

He's going to take you on a tour of a QV report so you can actually see what it looks like, all the things that are going to be included. I think that might alleviate some concerns too, because when you see how like in depth they go and the things that come out of it, it's like, oh, okay, you don't need to be that person.

Right? Like you're going to have a team of people that are really good at like doing the forensic analysis of the financials before you actually sign on the dotted line to. Verify everything is there and as it should be, or they're going to be like, Hey, um, you know, working capital needs to be this, or we don't agree with [00:40:00] these ad backs, or actually, this was something that you should take, you know, mine, so it'll adjust, you know, the SD and then you might have to retrain at that point.

And you'll have a. Very fancy report to be able to bring to the seller and be like, Hey, this isn't just me. Like, look, here's what it is. And that helps you. So he's going to take you on a tour of acuity and I've asked him, um, to have an in depth conversation about both working capital and work in progress.

So working capital is something that can completely catch you out if you don't negotiate it, you know, before you get under the offer. And then as you're going through diligence, um, and it's not something necessarily that like brokers on the small business side understand, um, which is wild to me, but. I went to the Texas Association of Business Brokers event last year, and I'm sitting in a room with hundreds of brokers that have been doing it for 20 years who were learning [00:41:00] about working capital for the first time and why it should be included.

So, a lot of times you end up having to educate the brokers too. But getting the amount of working capital, like, as, as, you know, like, just agreeing to get working capital in the purchase price, if they will not agree to it, then explaining and being able to tell them why you're adjusting that purchase price and then how you determine that afterwards and then making sure that you have enough so that when you take over the business on day 1, you're going to have expenses on day 1 in that business, but if, Uh, The accounts receivable are, like, on 30 or 60 day terms.

You can be waiting sometimes, like, 1 month, 2 months to start getting money in the door as a new owner, but you'll have 2 months of expenses. So making sure that you're covered for that while you're waiting for the money to come in. That's basically what working capital means and then work in progress is for any of those businesses where.

They might do projects that go [00:42:00] over an extended amount of time. So when you take over a business, if they do have projects, then they will have done some portion of the work, but you will have to complete some portion of the work. So, if you don't understand that concept, and you take over a business seller might have gotten paid for a bunch of work that, you know, have to deliver as the new owner.

But they already got paid for it, right? Um, so Chris is going to be doing a deep dive, both on working capital, work in progress, show you the QV report. Hopefully we'll get through all that. If not, he loves coming in and talking with you all. And I love getting you exposure to this kind of stuff in a way that you're not necessarily going to get elsewhere and you're able to ask him all your questions and stuff.

So bring all your questions, um, around working capital, QV, financial due diligence. Do do me a favor and watch that session that we did with him last time, though, so that we're picking up where we left off and not covering things that he already covered in the last session. Um, but that'll be a really [00:43:00] exciting one.

Um, we've got even more amazing people that we're talking to to come and do more sessions for you in the future. Um, are y'all enjoying the hearing from like buyers to and hearing their experiences after transition? Is that something you want more of? 

**Andrew:** Yes, for me. Yeah, most definitely. 

**Athena:** Andrew's got the best of which I kind of figure out what zoom like.

Can you still do the balloon? So you'd like to need to like, yeah. Okay, cool. More more buyers. Um, if there's are there any other topics or things that you feel like are still blind spots for you or places that you want us to spend more time on and topics that you want us to cover in future meetings.

**Andrew:** I'd be, I don't know, I don't know how I'm sure it's to be kind of difficult, but even like, [00:44:00] the post acquisition is really interesting. Um, but we're honestly, I would love to hear from somebody a year after a transition. You know, what's, you know, hindsight being 2020. what is. What is something that they wish they would have known or thought about preview?

I know 99 percent of the time that answer seems to be working capital, but just what they, you know, what they were excited for. What was a surprise? What was a team dynamics, you know, things like that, the, the stuff that you can't go. Listen to on acquiring minds, right? You know, what was what were the. What were those things and really get the meat and potatoes, not the PR version.

**Athena:** Yeah, that's a great point. I have a close friend who's about a year and a half into his, um, acquisition of a transmission repair business. And like we catch up at least once, a once a month. And the things that he is told me, I'm just like, oh my God. And he's been doing amazing. Right. So, um, I'll see if I can convince him.

I'm sure he will. He, he didn't wanna go on acquiring [00:45:00] mines 'cause. He doesn't want to, like, there was something in the purchase agreement about marketing the sale and that sort of thing. Um, but I bet he'll, he'll absolutely be up for it. And he's been on my mind, actually, to ask and come and talk about, um, but he, we could do several sessions with him, honestly, because even the way that he approached the whole acquisition process.

As well, as the transition afterwards is amazing. Um, I have another friend to that I have in mind. So I, I, you know, those sorts of things that you want to hear about, like, we, we all know people. So, like, keep them come and tell us what would be useful to you. And thinking of the post transition, like, what you're going to do.

When we're so caught up in the buying the business, actually, that's really essential. So I think that's a good thing to be thinking about is, like, what does it look like after we take it over? How do we need to prepare for that? After we take it over or what things come up, you know, [00:46:00] you agree, you sign a purchase agreement.

All the things are detailed, but a lot of times the seller might not actually understand what they signed, you know, so, like, you're still going to have to negotiate and deal with that relationship afterwards. Because if we're struggling to wrap our head around, like, you know, debt service coverage ratio and working capital and all that thing seller definitely is like, going to struggle and, you know, depending on who's in their corner, how well they explained it and that sort of thing.

Really great suggestion. So, yeah, I've got a couple of people in mind. I'll actually ask them this week if they'd be up for coming and doing future stuff. Thank you. Thanks. Anyone else got any, uh, topics, burning topics, things you're, are there any things that are like, just continue to be a block for you to work through that we can spend some more time on financial modeling is something that I know, uh, is still tough.

So, um, like, spoiler alert, I'm actually working, um, with a [00:47:00] couple people right now on trying to make a much more comprehensive. And easy to use financial modeling template for you all. So that's coming. I don't, you know, I like to under promise and ever deliver. So I don't want to give you a date yet, but that's in the works.

We should have it within a couple of weeks. I hope, but I know that's something that's, it's really difficult to kind of wrap your head around that and all the scenarios, but y'all are doing really well on it so far. And it's something that, um, Okay. You know, the lenders, at least that I talked to, like, when you show up with that, that modeling template, they're pretty impressed because a lot of people aren't able to do that.

Cool. Any other topics, thoughts, challenges? 

**Jason:** I would love to talk to, like, a commercial real estate agent. Like, I just don't understand commercial leasing and how it works. 

**Athena:** Perfect. I actually know an amazing guy here in Austin that has [00:48:00] often offered to help and speak to y'all if you have a specific thing.

Um, I think he covers nationwide too. Um, and also we have a resident expert. So, Andrew, is that something we could tap you up on to maybe talk to everybody about at some point?

Looks like you're muted. I'm sorry. 

**Andrew:** I couldn't get my mask to cooperate. Yeah, I'm happy to. That's what I do for a living. 

**Athena:** Okay, cool. Jason, if you were to give a, like, some more context in terms of what you're, what you're running into, what you don't understand, and on the commercial real estate side, and then Andrew, we can circle up and maybe talk through some, some points there.

**Jason:** Uh, to me, it's just, you know, it's, um, going through the due diligence to get to the point where you're talking to the landlord, transitioning over. You know, this, this lease to me, like, I want to make sure there's kind of no gotchas in there. Like, [00:49:00] I also want to have options to potentially, like, move the business somewhere else.

I don't want to get locked in, you know, four or five years and kind of get stuck in a, in a bad situation.

**Athena:** Cool. Andrew, I'll reach out to you directly and maybe we can brainstorm some stuff that, that will come up. Um, something to point out. Uh, Jason and, um, you know, Lindsay and Kevin talked about this is when you're using SBA and you have a physical location, they are going to want to see options at least for you to stay in the same place for the life of the loan.

Um, so that can that can be a challenge sometimes and how you negotiate that, or how you structure it. So, you know, uh, it sounds like what Lindsay and Kevin ended up doing was like, the 3 year lease within, like, uh, well, what they were originally trying to do was, like, an option every year. So, at least they could get out, you know, after the year, but they had the option to stay there for [00:50:00] 10 years.

Also, some of you are potentially looking at buying the real estate too. So I think it'd be worth talking about that. Like when the first business that I looked at that had real estate attached to it, I'm not a real estate person. It's never really been an interest. So I just didn't even know, like, how do you value it?

Like, where does the value come from? So I was like running around all the local Austin, like real estate events, grabbing my real estate brokers. And I was like, explain it to me. And I still maybe because Andrew, uh, has an amazing, like training background and stuff. So maybe he'll be able to like demystify this a little bit, but I'm still trying to wrap my head around where the value actually comes from, from real estate and how you would like, um, you know, uh, uh, like figure out what the value of real estate is or even how it is valued.

So is that something you'd be up for to Andrew? 

**Andrew:** Yeah, it's very similar to this. I mean, it's very similar. I mean, if you're looking at net operating [00:51:00] income versus EBITDA, I mean, it's, it's effectively it. And if it's vacant, there's another set of deals, but it's very value driven based off of the rents.

**Athena:** Yeah, and then, you know, things like operates and like, I don't know if people, if you've never leased a building before, like, understanding what triple net means and what the impact is going to be on, you know, so there's actually, I'm so glad you said that Jason, because there's a lot of gotchas when y'all are looking at real estate, even leasing like triple net versus the landlord covering some things can have a significant impact on, um, your net income, your cashflow after the fact, if the landlord was, Was, you know, covering all that, not putting those expenses into the, the P and L.

So, 

**Andrew:** so, I mean, a real quick 1, just to think about Jason, like, 1st off, most landlords are not going to want to give you a flat 10 year lease because that that removes their ability to take advantage of whatever the market does. So they'll have some degree of an option. Right? Like, um, Yeah. Like what Athena was saying, you [00:52:00] know, 3, 5 year terms typical with 3 to 4 percent bumps, depending on where you are per year, uh, but with a classic gotcha is not negotiating what those option lease rates are going to be because they can put in quote market rent.

You know, the, the rent will come up to quote market rent. Well, if I'm in Austin, Texas, and I signed a lease 5 years ago. And I've got a renewal coming up this year. Guess what? My, my rent may have just doubled. And if I don't have that prepared for my bottom line and I've levered to the nines to buy this business, then I've, I've got a pretty serious bottom line issue.

So, um, options are probably what's going to happen more often than not. And you're going to want to pre negotiate with those options are going to be you don't want to have it just be market rent. Now, sometimes market rent can help you too. And you might get burned by setting it right now. Maybe maybe the bottom falls out wherever you are, but I'd rather have an expectation rather than an open ended market market [00:53:00] valuation.

**Athena:** Yeah, agree. Also, um, if the, if the owner of the business owns the real estate. And making sure you get built in first right of refusal for you to buy it. If they decide to sell it, because that can also be an, you know, if you decide not to buy the real estate when you're purchasing the business, which, you know, it's, it's good to look at that, even if you're not a real estate person, like, look at it and see and we've talked about this in the past on SBA loans that can expand.

Send your amortization if you were to package it in the loan, it actually might be, you know, this, it wouldn't have an impact on the cash flow to buy the business, whether you put it in the loan or not. And you have another asset that that's building value, but if you decided not to buy it, the owner owns it and is your landlord.

If you don't do that 1st, right of refusal, there's nothing to stop them from, like, selling it to somebody else that can end up, like, you know, making your life hell or [00:54:00] jacking up your prices and that sort of thing. So, um, really good topic to touch on Jason. So much to talk about there. Andrew, I'm gonna I'm gonna tap you up for that.

Because I think you will, you know, you're already in the group and you have so much amazing experience in that space that you could, uh. You know, help everybody wrap their head around it for those of us that aren't, uh, real estate experts. So good point. Cool. Amazing. Thank you. Keep the topics coming.

Y'all use that buyer's club channel. It's there for you to, you know, shout out anything. If you want to hear more of it, or if we had someone you knew want to dive deeper or, you know, any topics, things, challenges that you have, we're going to Continuously be booking out more people to come. Um, and then we'll go through things ourselves, too.

And we feel that we're the best fit to kind of talk you through some things next Tuesday is going to be another open forum. So do feel to come with deals if you want to talk through modeling. Like, we can even get your modeling up [00:55:00] and mess around with it, you know, in real time and think about structuring and that sort of thing.

So use these sessions to practice or bounce things off of us. Uh, next Thursday is going to be Chris doing the part two of financial due diligence with the QV, the work in progress, the working capital, um, and then we'll announce some of the future ones. So I've got a couple of conversations to have and get people booked in, but I'm excited because I think those will be amazing too.

So, um. Really excited for how everybody's progressing on stuff too. There's a lot of movement now. So we're excited for you all. Thank you for spending your time with us. Um, and. Have a great rest of your day and good weekend.

Appreciate it. 

**Joe:** Thank you. 

**Athena:** Yeah, bye.
