Anke Badenhorst (AcquiMatch): Well, thank you so much for meeting with me today. What we're going to do today is a technical onboarding. I'm going to take you through some slides to refresh your memory on what the onboarding process is going to look like, and then after that we'll get you set up on the different platforms that you need.

Peter Jackson: Okay, cool.

Anke Badenhorst (AcquiMatch): Perfect. And stop me anytime if you have a question. All right, beautiful. Let me share my screen. Can you see it?

Peter Jackson: Yes.

Anke Badenhorst (AcquiMatch): Perfect. So just a quick refresher. I know we looked at this screen last time as well. We're going to be setting you up on Slack and Notion. During the onboarding process, you're going to fill in a client information form. Then you're going to have two two-hour onboarding calls. One's going to be with Athena, the other one's going to be with Ryan, and that's where they're going to go through detailed questions, building your deal box, your buyer profile. You're going to fill out a detailed questionnaire as well. After that, we'll finalize your deal box and buyer profile for you to sign off on. I'm going to take you through getting SBA pre-qualified, and then there's some homework on your dashboard.

So what the investor profile is, is we're going to take everything that we've learned from you, everything that Athena and Ryan get from you in all of these onboarding sessions and the questionnaires. You're going to be sending me your LinkedIn and resume on some of the forms that I'm going to give you. And then from all of that, we build out what we call your investor profile. This is what we then use when we introduce you to brokers and owners. It's a nice page that has everything they need to know about you.

Okay, so what happens after you've gone through this onboarding process: there's going to be a period where we're on the back end setting up the on- and off-market campaigns to identify opportunities that align with your criteria, and then we're going to launch your search. The first period is the calibration period, where the first week we're going to focus on understanding your preferences. We might give you a few temp checks. And then you can expect two to four high-quality deals per month that we're going to put in front of you.

So the key engagement point is, you've heard Athena say this a thousand times, time kills all deals, right? So you're going to have to move fast. When we put a deal in front of you, we would like you to share your thoughts within 48 hours so that if you want to move forward with this deal, we can go ahead and make the introductions needed. As you know, the market is extremely competitive. Moving fast gets you in front of the brokers and the sellers quicker. Also, giving us feedback on the deals that we put in front of you helps us fine-tune and calibrate your deal box even further.

So the different tools and resources that we use: we're going to be using Slack for communication. Have you ever used Slack? Are you familiar with it?

Peter Jackson: Yes, yes, I have used it. And inside of our company, we use Microsoft Teams, Microsoft's rip-off of Slack.

Anke Badenhorst (AcquiMatch): Okay, yeah. So that's going to make the onboarding process even easier since you're already familiar with Slack. We're going to keep all communication inside of Slack. You're going to have your own dedicated Slack channel. The entire team is going to be on that. Any question you have, anything you want to send us, do it in that channel. We keep all of the comms in that channel so the entire team is aware of everything that's going on with your deals, and anybody can jump in and support at any time. And for your AcquiMatch dashboard, we're utilizing Notion, so that's where your homework is going to be. Your deal tracker is also going to be on that. You're going to see your write-ups on those, as well as some deal resources.

Any questions on that before I get you set up?

Peter Jackson: No.

Anke Badenhorst (AcquiMatch): Okay, perfect. Let me ask you this first. Do you have Slack installed on your PC?

Peter Jackson: I do. Yes, I do. I have a couple of channels. I haven't opened it in a while, but I have a couple of channels on it right now.

Anke Badenhorst (AcquiMatch): Okay, good. This email that I sent you on, is that the ideal email that I can use for everything we're going to be working with you on?

Peter Jackson: Did you send it to MillerIndustrial99@gmail.com? Is that the one?

Anke Badenhorst (AcquiMatch): Yes, perfect. Then I can use that email. I'm going to send you an invite directly from Slack. MillerIndustrial99@gmail.com. Okay, sent. Let me know if you have received that email. Just go through the steps in that email, and then I will see you pop up in this channel.

Peter Jackson: Thank you.
