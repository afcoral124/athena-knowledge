00:00:10.765 --> 00:00:15.695
Okay, welcome everyone to this webinar on

00:00:16.535 --> 00:00:20.735
Building Your Personal Buyer brand in AC of Searchers.

3
00:00:21.475 --> 00:00:22.575
My name is Will Smith.

4
00:00:22.675 --> 00:00:24.775
I'm the host of the podcast Acquiring Minds,

5
00:00:25.115 --> 00:00:29.135
and today's speaker is Athena Simpson of Acqui Match.

6
00:00:29.555 --> 00:00:31.735
You may have heard Athena's name in a few

7
00:00:31.735 --> 00:00:33.135
Acquiring Minds episodes.

8
00:00:33.545 --> 00:00:36.975
She's helped guests on the podcast buy their businesses.

9
00:00:37.475 --> 00:00:40.255
She was a searcher herself, so she understands

10
00:00:40.765 --> 00:00:42.775
what it's all about, the risks, the costs,

11
00:00:43.155 --> 00:00:44.815
the heartbreak, the joy.

12
00:00:45.635 --> 00:00:48.135
I'm gonna hand the mic over to Athena in just a sec

13
00:00:48.195 --> 00:00:50.255
to do a proper introduction of herself,

14
00:00:50.955 --> 00:00:52.535
but some quick housekeeping.

15
00:00:52.625 --> 00:00:54.735
First, we're recording the session.

16
00:00:54.835 --> 00:00:59.255
As always, we're gonna get it to you on, uh, uh, the, a link

17
00:00:59.255 --> 00:01:02.135

18
00:01:02.395 --> 00:01:04.855
So watch Monday for that in your inbox.

19
00:01:06.235 --> 00:01:07.695
And if you have a question,

20
00:01:07.875 --> 00:01:10.015
you can just use the q and a button here.

21
00:01:10.435 --> 00:01:15.135
Um, in Zoom, uh, we don't use chat, so questions in q and a.

22
00:01:15.425 --> 00:01:17.095
We'll do q and A at the end,

23
00:01:17.555 --> 00:01:20.335
but feel free to put your questions in there as we go.

24
00:01:20.755 --> 00:01:22.735
Uh, and we'll turn our attention to everything

25
00:01:22.735 --> 00:01:25.215
that's come in during the q and a session.

26
00:01:25.875 --> 00:01:28.695
And with that Athena Simpson, please introduce yourself

27
00:01:28.695 --> 00:01:29.975
and take us into your presentation.

28
00:01:31.185 --> 00:01:32.685
Uh, amazing. Let me go ahead

29
00:01:32.685 --> 00:01:35.205
and pull up my slides for you all

30
00:01:36.345 --> 00:01:37.965
and get presenting.

31
00:01:39.775 --> 00:01:42.185
Okay. Can you see the slides? All right.

32
00:01:42.795 --> 00:01:44.105
Looks, yeah, looks great.

33
00:01:44.615 --> 00:01:45.825
Amazing. Okay, cool.

34
00:01:46.125 --> 00:01:48.145
I'm so excited to talk about this topic.

35
00:01:48.405 --> 00:01:51.145
Uh, it's something deeply personal to me

36
00:01:51.525 --> 00:01:52.665
and also something

37
00:01:52.665 --> 00:01:55.305
that you all are super up against right now.

38
00:01:55.725 --> 00:01:56.905
So we're gonna talk about that.

39
00:01:57.285 --> 00:01:59.425
Um, but before we get into that, who am I?

40
00:01:59.445 --> 00:02:00.585
Hi, I'm Athena Simpson.

41
00:02:01.005 --> 00:02:03.265
I'm the founder and CEO of Acqui Match.

42
00:02:03.725 --> 00:02:05.345
We are acquisition matchmakers

and we help turn first time buyers into business owners,

44
00:02:09.285 --> 00:02:10.585
one match at a time.

45
00:02:11.165 --> 00:02:13.385
Um, and just a little bit about me.

46
00:02:13.545 --> 00:02:15.425
'cause when I'm in talks, I'm like, who is this person?

47
00:02:15.425 --> 00:02:18.105
Should I listen to you? Um, I'm a five x founder.

48
00:02:18.585 --> 00:02:20.185
I love starting businesses.

49
00:02:20.645 --> 00:02:24.185
Um, I have 25 years experience building, scaling

50
00:02:24.365 --> 00:02:26.025
and advising businesses.

51
00:02:26.295 --> 00:02:28.025
I've helped thousands of startups

52
00:02:28.025 --> 00:02:29.785
and founders start scale and raises capital.

53
00:02:30.205 --> 00:02:32.945
Um, I've advised everything from Fortune 500 to fts,

54
00:02:32.945 --> 00:02:35.185
E 100 investors, government clients, uh,

00:02:35.325 --> 00:02:37.625
on their operations, innovation, investment,

56
00:02:37.775 --> 00:02:39.905
scaling across the globe.

57
00:02:40.485 --> 00:02:43.545
Um, former entrepreneurship lecturer at the McComb School

58
00:02:43.545 --> 00:02:45.985
of Business here in Texas at ut.

59
00:02:46.565 --> 00:02:47.705
And as Will mentioned,

60
00:02:47.865 --> 00:02:50.985
I am the former fellow searcher, failed searcher.

61
00:02:51.015 --> 00:02:52.105
I've got the battle wounds.

62
00:02:52.105 --> 00:02:53.545
I'm gonna tell you that story in a second.

63
00:02:53.885 --> 00:02:56.585
Um, and I'm super active in the ETA community.

64
00:02:56.905 --> 00:02:59.645
I love this space. I love what everybody is doing.

65
00:02:59.825 --> 00:03:00.965
I'm so passionate about it,

66
00:03:00.965 --> 00:03:02.765
and I think it's such an amazing opportunity.

67
00:03:03.425 --> 00:03:06.045
Um, founded AC iMatch in 2023.

68
00:03:06.345 --> 00:03:07.365
And fun fact,

69
00:03:07.685 --> 00:03:11.245
I have actually been teaching branding since 2012 when I was

70
00:03:11.245 --> 00:03:13.765
at Guinness World Records and I was creating products

71
00:03:13.835 --> 00:03:16.165
that we licensed and franchised out.

72
00:03:16.475 --> 00:03:18.965
Well, Guinness World Records is a brand

73
00:03:18.965 --> 00:03:20.485
that's literally what it's business is.

74
00:03:20.505 --> 00:03:22.325
So we had to teach people how to protect it,

75
00:03:22.325 --> 00:03:23.525
and I had to get them bought into

76
00:03:23.625 --> 00:03:24.725
why they should protect it.

77
00:03:25.035 --> 00:03:26.765
That made me fall in love with branding

78
00:03:26.785 --> 00:03:28.685
and it's a concept I've been teaching to founders

79
00:03:28.785 --> 00:03:32.205
and businesses and yourselves, um, for quite a long time.

80
00:03:32.425 --> 00:03:35.285
So, um, this is actually part one

81
00:03:35.285 --> 00:03:36.845
of part two that we're gonna be doing.

82
00:03:36.905 --> 00:03:39.125
So go ahead and scan that QR code real quick.

83
00:03:39.465 --> 00:03:41.165
That's the link to October 9th.

84
00:03:41.175 --> 00:03:43.325
We're gonna be talking about using EQ

85
00:03:43.785 --> 00:03:45.325
to win over sellers and brokers.

86
00:03:45.345 --> 00:03:46.965
So today we're talking about the brand

87
00:03:46.985 --> 00:03:48.165
and how you're showing up.

88
00:03:48.705 --> 00:03:50.205
And that session is gonna be about

89
00:03:50.225 --> 00:03:53.285
how you're actually interacting, um, and using EQ

90
00:03:53.285 --> 00:03:55.005
because it's just as important

91
00:03:55.145 --> 00:03:57.325
as understanding the process is actually building

92
00:03:57.325 --> 00:03:59.285
that relationship and rapport throughout.

93
00:04:00.415 --> 00:04:02.765
Today, what we're gonna be talking about is

94
00:04:02.905 --> 00:04:05.125
how you become a buyer of choice 1 0 1.

95
00:04:05.145 --> 00:04:07.885
So like branding 1 0 1 as a searcher,

96
00:04:08.425 --> 00:04:11.245
and then talking about how your strengths can actually be

97
00:04:11.245 --> 00:04:12.325
turned into weaknesses.

98
00:04:13.025 --> 00:04:14.405
How do you actually do it?

99
00:04:14.505 --> 00:04:17.165
And at the end, there'll be time for plenty of questions.

100
00:04:17.585 --> 00:04:18.805
Um, I'm gonna stay on

101
00:04:18.805 --> 00:04:21.365
and answer all your questions until Will kicks me off.

102
00:04:21.505 --> 00:04:22.605
So I'm here for it.

103
00:04:22.885 --> 00:04:25.805
I think we might go over an hour potentially.

104
00:04:26.145 --> 00:04:28.525
So, uh, cancel your next meetings if you're liking this

105
00:04:28.525 --> 00:04:29.885
conversation and have some questions.

106
00:04:30.005 --> 00:04:32.925
I wanna get 'em all answered. Um, okay, so

107
00:04:34.305 --> 00:04:35.445
what's going on right now?

108
00:04:35.505 --> 00:04:38.165
The internet is going crazy for business buying

109
00:04:38.425 --> 00:04:41.645
and everyone's being told you can do this for zero money

110
00:04:41.985 --> 00:04:43.965
and you buy businesses and you get to go travel

111
00:04:43.985 --> 00:04:46.005
and sit on the beach while these businesses cash flow

112
00:04:46.245 --> 00:04:48.845
businesses or cash flow like cash to your bank account.

113
00:04:49.385 --> 00:04:54.045
Um, that is not the case at all. Reality is very different.

114
00:04:54.045 --> 00:04:57.285
However, what that means is there's a whole bunch of people

115
00:04:57.795 --> 00:04:59.125
that are getting these messages

116
00:04:59.125 --> 00:05:02.525
that are interested in business buying, which then

117
00:05:03.035 --> 00:05:06.685
this industry, I liken it to entering the world's largest

118
00:05:07.615 --> 00:05:10.805
poker tournament and anyone can enter, right?

119
00:05:11.105 --> 00:05:14.125
So the small business buying tournament, you

120
00:05:14.305 --> 00:05:16.965
as a first time buyer and this entire presentation is gonna

121
00:05:16.965 --> 00:05:19.165
be speaking to first time buyers, right?

122
00:05:19.165 --> 00:05:21.205
Because that's where the branding is really

123
00:05:21.205 --> 00:05:22.325
gonna come into play for you.

124
00:05:22.325 --> 00:05:23.325
You're at a disadvantage

125
00:05:23.845 --> 00:05:26.365
'cause you're up against people that have the experience,

126
00:05:26.755 --> 00:05:29.085
that have the team, that have the money

127
00:05:29.825 --> 00:05:31.405
to actually get deals done.

128
00:05:31.405 --> 00:05:32.445
And they've done it in the past.

129
00:05:32.585 --> 00:05:34.245
You're up against strategic investors.

130
00:05:34.345 --> 00:05:35.485
You're up against people

131
00:05:35.485 --> 00:05:37.445
that raised funds to do their search.

132
00:05:37.445 --> 00:05:39.565
You're up against private equity,

133
00:05:39.565 --> 00:05:41.325
you're up against people that have bought businesses.

134
00:05:41.385 --> 00:05:42.645
You're up against me

135
00:05:42.645 --> 00:05:45.565
and my team with search on behalf

136
00:05:45.565 --> 00:05:47.645
of clients as a first timer.

137
00:05:47.945 --> 00:05:52.045
And your goal is to try to get to the final table, right?

138
00:05:52.865 --> 00:05:54.565
And most of you don't have enough playing

139
00:05:54.565 --> 00:05:56.085
experience to even know how to do that.

140
00:05:56.305 --> 00:05:57.325
And then when you get to the

141
00:05:57.325 --> 00:05:58.485
final table, how do you do that?

142
00:05:58.835 --> 00:06:01.725
Well, psychology is a big part of poker, right?

143
00:06:01.855 --> 00:06:05.605
Psychology perception, brand is gonna come into that.

144
00:06:06.065 --> 00:06:08.285
So think about that as you're going through this.

145
00:06:08.285 --> 00:06:09.285
This is one of those things

146
00:06:09.285 --> 00:06:10.965
that's gonna give you an edge in this tournament.

147
00:06:11.595 --> 00:06:14.685
Real quick, my lesson in this, um,

148
00:06:15.795 --> 00:06:19.405
when I was searching, I found my perfect business.

149
00:06:19.885 --> 00:06:22.005
I saw myself running it.

150
00:06:22.165 --> 00:06:23.485
I had the experience

151
00:06:23.485 --> 00:06:25.925
and skillset to be able to take it to the next level.

152
00:06:26.485 --> 00:06:28.365
I had an amazing relationship with the owners.

153
00:06:28.525 --> 00:06:30.485
I had an amazing relationship with the broker.

154
00:06:30.835 --> 00:06:33.045
They were all cheering me on, even though I,

155
00:06:33.245 --> 00:06:35.365
I was first timer, didn't know what I was doing

156
00:06:35.545 --> 00:06:37.685
and asking price was $8 million.

157
00:06:37.925 --> 00:06:39.245
I was like, how did I even end up

158
00:06:39.245 --> 00:06:40.285
looking at a deal this big?

159
00:06:40.365 --> 00:06:43.165
I started out on a hundred thousand dollars laundromats.

160
00:06:43.165 --> 00:06:45.045
Like the rest of you probably did too.

161
00:06:45.585 --> 00:06:47.005
So it was this big girl deal

162
00:06:47.005 --> 00:06:48.245
that I had no idea what I was doing.

163
00:06:48.245 --> 00:06:50.125
There was no advisors or anyone like me

164
00:06:50.345 --> 00:06:52.725
or you know, content out there on how

165
00:06:52.725 --> 00:06:55.005
to actually structure this or what to do.

166
00:06:55.425 --> 00:06:57.405
And it was an amazing deal.

167
00:06:57.505 --> 00:07:00.285
So there was 14 other buyers in the mix, most

168
00:07:00.285 --> 00:07:03.805
of which were experienced buyers of businesses.

169
00:07:03.905 --> 00:07:07.685
So I was, you know, the the David in this Goliath situation,

170
00:07:07.745 --> 00:07:08.885
but they wanted me to win

171
00:07:08.885 --> 00:07:11.485
because of the brand that I put out there

172
00:07:11.485 --> 00:07:12.845
and how I interacted with them.

173
00:07:13.825 --> 00:07:16.885
Um, and when it came down to it, they're like, look,

174
00:07:16.885 --> 00:07:19.125
we believe that you can buy this business

175
00:07:19.345 --> 00:07:20.685
and would be a good owner of it,

176
00:07:20.685 --> 00:07:21.685
but there's a question mark

177
00:07:21.685 --> 00:07:23.365
of whether you'd be able to finance it or not.

178
00:07:23.365 --> 00:07:26.085
And I was like, don't we figure that out after LOI?

179
00:07:26.705 --> 00:07:28.685
And they're like, no, uh, there's people

180
00:07:28.685 --> 00:07:30.765
that can actually buy this business and have the money.

181
00:07:30.885 --> 00:07:34.485
I was like, okay, what do I need to do? Go talk to broker.

182
00:07:34.485 --> 00:07:36.685
Introduced me to the banker that he liked.

183
00:07:36.705 --> 00:07:38.605
And he is like, if the banker tells me you can do it,

184
00:07:38.605 --> 00:07:41.045
then I will keep you in the next round.

185
00:07:41.175 --> 00:07:43.845
After the cuts. He's like, okay, go to the banker.

186
00:07:44.195 --> 00:07:46.885
He's like, what do I need to do? And he's basically told me

187
00:07:47.005 --> 00:07:51.485
I need to raise $3 million to make up for the risk

188
00:07:51.485 --> 00:07:53.845
that they were gonna have on an air ball like this.

189
00:07:53.905 --> 00:07:56.245
It was high growth business, lots of risk lender.

190
00:07:56.685 --> 00:07:58.085
I, you know, was looking out

191
00:07:58.085 --> 00:07:59.525
for their own interests in this.

192
00:07:59.605 --> 00:08:01.845
I didn't know it at the time. Went to the broker

193
00:08:03.015 --> 00:08:04.475
and I thought I'd done such a good

194
00:08:04.475 --> 00:08:05.515
job at building up the brand.

195
00:08:05.595 --> 00:08:08.755
I was like, Hey, so I know I'm the chosen buyer,

196
00:08:09.355 --> 00:08:11.595
I just need some time to go raise $3 million.

197
00:08:11.895 --> 00:08:16.875
And he is like, okay. Um, you can have until Wednesday.

198
00:08:17.095 --> 00:08:18.875
And I was like, but it's Friday

199
00:08:18.975 --> 00:08:20.635
before a three day holiday weekend.

200
00:08:20.635 --> 00:08:22.355
And he is like, I don't know what to tell you Athena.

201
00:08:22.355 --> 00:08:24.315
There's other people that can actually get this deal done.

202
00:08:25.465 --> 00:08:27.165
So here I was thinking

203
00:08:27.165 --> 00:08:29.245
that I was the strongest person in this mix

204
00:08:29.305 --> 00:08:31.965
and I was now at a situation where I was gonna have

205
00:08:31.965 --> 00:08:36.755
to raise $3 million in five days over a three day weekend.

206
00:08:37.215 --> 00:08:38.395
And I did it.

207
00:08:39.155 --> 00:08:40.915
I, I, I went out and I raised that money

208
00:08:42.175 --> 00:08:44.635
and I thought for sure I was gonna get that business.

209
00:08:45.335 --> 00:08:47.115
And I ended up not getting it

210
00:08:47.115 --> 00:08:50.595
because my offer was 2 million less than somebody else in

211
00:08:50.595 --> 00:08:52.715
the mix that knew what they were doing with structuring.

212
00:08:53.455 --> 00:08:56.205
And they actually deliberated

213
00:08:56.505 --> 00:08:59.125
for longer than they should have like on.

214
00:08:59.235 --> 00:09:00.765
They really wanted me to be it.

215
00:09:00.905 --> 00:09:02.285
But they ended up choosing someone

216
00:09:02.285 --> 00:09:03.525
that offered them 2 million more.

217
00:09:04.025 --> 00:09:08.565
Um, I wouldn't have even gotten to that stage had I not

218
00:09:09.075 --> 00:09:11.605
focused on my brand, the story,

219
00:09:11.745 --> 00:09:14.045
the interactions I was having with them.

220
00:09:14.705 --> 00:09:17.805
Um, I had no business being in that, but I did

221
00:09:17.805 --> 00:09:19.405
because of how I showed up.

222
00:09:19.865 --> 00:09:21.845
Um, so off the back of that,

223
00:09:21.885 --> 00:09:23.045
I ended up starting this business

224
00:09:23.045 --> 00:09:26.045
because I was the right owner of that business, hands down.

225
00:09:26.065 --> 00:09:27.365
But I wasn't the right buyer.

226
00:09:27.945 --> 00:09:31.645
And that's really important to me. That's why I am here.

227
00:09:31.915 --> 00:09:34.085
It's why I do this. It's why I started my company.

228
00:09:34.685 --> 00:09:36.765
I think there's a lot of first time buyers out there

229
00:09:36.765 --> 00:09:38.565
that are gonna make amazing business owners,

230
00:09:38.985 --> 00:09:42.085
but they need to be helped to become the right buyer.

231
00:09:42.545 --> 00:09:43.765
And that's what you need to think about.

232
00:09:43.825 --> 00:09:45.925
You need to be thinking about how am I the right buyer

233
00:09:45.985 --> 00:09:48.205
of this business in addition to the right owner,

234
00:09:48.995 --> 00:09:50.405
what you're up against.

235
00:09:51.355 --> 00:09:52.965
There's not great perceptions

236
00:09:52.965 --> 00:09:54.325
of first time buyers out there,

237
00:09:55.015 --> 00:09:57.725
especially since the internet has caught wind of this.

238
00:09:59.185 --> 00:10:03.005
You are being viewed through the lens of a first timer

239
00:10:03.005 --> 00:10:04.405
that probably has no money.

240
00:10:04.405 --> 00:10:05.925
They're gonna be a headache. They're not gonna have

241
00:10:05.925 --> 00:10:07.005
the grit to get this done.

242
00:10:07.235 --> 00:10:08.365
They're gonna get scared.

243
00:10:08.795 --> 00:10:10.565
They don't have the right support behind them.

244
00:10:10.565 --> 00:10:12.245
They're not gonna be able to close.

245
00:10:12.655 --> 00:10:15.005
These are the things that brokers and owners

246
00:10:15.345 --> 00:10:17.165
and lenders are thinking about.

247
00:10:17.185 --> 00:10:20.365
You, you have the, the deck stacked against you

248
00:10:20.995 --> 00:10:23.245
even being a first timer that's never bought a business.

249
00:10:24.265 --> 00:10:27.085
So this is the perception that you have to overcome

250
00:10:27.085 --> 00:10:28.125
with your brand.

251
00:10:29.175 --> 00:10:32.555
You also need to think about where you stand in this, right?

252
00:10:32.745 --> 00:10:33.755
Like, I can't tell you

253
00:10:33.755 --> 00:10:36.235
how many people are like broker was mean or shut me down

254
00:10:36.255 --> 00:10:37.275
or didn't respond to me.

255
00:10:37.275 --> 00:10:39.115
Like, know your place, right?

256
00:10:39.375 --> 00:10:40.835
People are broker bashing,

257
00:10:40.855 --> 00:10:42.435
but you probably don't know what you're doing.

258
00:10:42.735 --> 00:10:44.075
And when they put up a listing,

259
00:10:44.075 --> 00:10:46.835
they get 200 inquiries in the first hour.

260
00:10:47.425 --> 00:10:50.355
Many from qualified buyers that have done this before. Okay?

261
00:10:50.575 --> 00:10:52.075
So eat a piece of humble pie.

262
00:10:52.525 --> 00:10:55.115
We're gonna go through how you can actually show up

263
00:10:55.115 --> 00:10:58.035
as somebody that authentically is a first timer,

264
00:10:58.035 --> 00:10:59.275
but as someone that gets chosen,

265
00:10:59.975 --> 00:11:02.635
you are being vetted every stage of it.

266
00:11:02.695 --> 00:11:05.395
How you interact, how you show up, your timeliness,

267
00:11:05.615 --> 00:11:06.875
how people feel about you.

268
00:11:07.415 --> 00:11:09.915
So it is important that you're thinking about that

269
00:11:10.545 --> 00:11:12.755
with every interaction that you have

270
00:11:12.755 --> 00:11:15.795
with every service provider, lender, broker, et cetera.

271
00:11:15.865 --> 00:11:17.195
They are vetting you.

272
00:11:17.775 --> 00:11:19.635
Do you have what it takes to get it done?

273
00:11:19.635 --> 00:11:22.635
Because 20 to 50% of deals that don't close

274
00:11:22.635 --> 00:11:26.115
after LOI are due to buyer issues

275
00:11:26.575 --> 00:11:28.955
and competency, getting scared, et cetera.

276
00:11:28.975 --> 00:11:30.955
So you're more than half the problem, right?

277
00:11:31.015 --> 00:11:33.955
And they know that and their paychecks are relying on that.

278
00:11:34.875 --> 00:11:37.695
So let's talk about how to become the right buyer

279
00:11:37.925 --> 00:11:39.895
through the lens of branding

280
00:11:43.325 --> 00:11:45.955
every time you interact with someone.

281
00:11:46.575 --> 00:11:48.275
And, and look at this through the lens

282
00:11:48.275 --> 00:11:49.835
as a business owner too, right?

283
00:11:49.865 --> 00:11:51.875
Like personal brand and business brand.

284
00:11:51.875 --> 00:11:55.685
There's a lot of these things that, that, um, can relate.

285
00:11:56.075 --> 00:11:59.005
When you put out a piece of, uh, content.

286
00:11:59.115 --> 00:12:01.525
When you interact with someone, when you reach out

287
00:12:01.525 --> 00:12:04.805
to someone, the automatic response is always, so what,

288
00:12:04.835 --> 00:12:07.205
when someone sees a piece of, uh, like advertisement.

289
00:12:07.265 --> 00:12:11.685
So what, what's in it for me? People do not care about you.

290
00:12:11.685 --> 00:12:13.605
They care about what you can do for them.

291
00:12:14.625 --> 00:12:17.245
And it's not that people are bad, that's just literally

292
00:12:17.265 --> 00:12:19.445
how we're wired for survival, right?

293
00:12:19.515 --> 00:12:20.685
Like, what's in it for me?

294
00:12:20.745 --> 00:12:22.245
How can I take care of myself first,

295
00:12:22.315 --> 00:12:24.045
even if people are big hearted

296
00:12:24.065 --> 00:12:25.405
and look out for people, et cetera.

297
00:12:25.545 --> 00:12:28.005
So if you could think about the psychology of

298
00:12:28.005 --> 00:12:30.045
what people are thinking when you interact with them,

299
00:12:30.385 --> 00:12:31.725
you can use that to your advantage.

300
00:12:32.185 --> 00:12:34.965
How can I communicate what's in it for this person?

301
00:12:35.065 --> 00:12:36.645
How can I think about what's important

302
00:12:36.705 --> 00:12:38.165
to them as I go through this?

303
00:12:39.845 --> 00:12:41.505
People wanna be a part of something.

304
00:12:41.565 --> 00:12:44.225
People wanna know why you're doing what you're doing.

305
00:12:47.105 --> 00:12:49.035
When Kennedy had the space program

306
00:12:49.135 --> 00:12:51.035
and they were trying to put a man on the moon, it was,

307
00:12:51.035 --> 00:12:52.755
it was a crazy idea at the time, right?

308
00:12:52.935 --> 00:12:55.315
He was touring the space station, um,

309
00:12:55.815 --> 00:12:59.535
and like where they were working on getting a man on the

310
00:12:59.535 --> 00:13:01.735
moon and he saw a man mopping the floor

311
00:13:01.795 --> 00:13:03.535
and he went over to him and he said, what are you doing?

312
00:13:04.575 --> 00:13:07.255
A man said, I'm helping put a man on the moon.

313
00:13:09.505 --> 00:13:13.775
That mission was so well understood

314
00:13:14.045 --> 00:13:17.375
that the person cleaning the floors understood their unique

315
00:13:17.775 --> 00:13:19.615
contribution to something bigger than themselves.

316
00:13:20.725 --> 00:13:22.695
When you can think about why you're doing it

317
00:13:23.685 --> 00:13:25.185
and what you can do for somebody else

318
00:13:25.565 --> 00:13:28.345
and how you can paint that big picture of

319
00:13:29.295 --> 00:13:30.425
what the mission is

320
00:13:30.425 --> 00:13:33.265
and how that person's involved in it, you give them purpose,

321
00:13:33.325 --> 00:13:35.505
you give them meaning, you get them excited about you.

322
00:13:36.105 --> 00:13:39.345
I wholeheartedly believe that I was able to raise $3 million

323
00:13:39.345 --> 00:13:40.945
because people wanted to be part

324
00:13:41.325 --> 00:13:43.945
of doing something absolutely crazy and incredible

325
00:13:44.125 --> 00:13:46.505
and support somebody that was crazy enough to go out

326
00:13:46.505 --> 00:13:48.385
and try to do it right.

327
00:13:49.165 --> 00:13:51.745
Um, people get excited about that.

328
00:13:52.205 --> 00:13:56.305
So that's when you're thinking about brand, it's not

329
00:13:56.875 --> 00:14:01.025
logos, it's not imagery, it's how you make people feel.

330
00:14:01.675 --> 00:14:03.625
Brand is the personality that people think

331
00:14:03.645 --> 00:14:05.185
of when they interact with you

332
00:14:05.685 --> 00:14:07.665
and how you get them bought in

333
00:14:07.885 --> 00:14:09.665
to the mission is a big part of that.

334
00:14:10.405 --> 00:14:14.495
And this is like marketing branding 1 0 1.

335
00:14:14.795 --> 00:14:17.375
You cannot get somebody to buy something from you

336
00:14:17.475 --> 00:14:18.775
and make no mistake.

337
00:14:18.995 --> 00:14:21.575
You are, you are selling, if you are buying a business,

338
00:14:21.595 --> 00:14:23.135
you are in the business of selling.

339
00:14:23.435 --> 00:14:26.615
You have to sell yourself to the owner, to the broker,

340
00:14:26.915 --> 00:14:29.735
to the lenders, to everyone that's interacting with you

341
00:14:29.755 --> 00:14:31.255
to get this deal over the line.

342
00:14:32.035 --> 00:14:33.175
And if you don't like selling

343
00:14:33.595 --> 00:14:35.535
or don't see yourself doing selling,

344
00:14:35.635 --> 00:14:36.855
you probably should question

345
00:14:36.855 --> 00:14:37.975
whether you should be a business owner.

346
00:14:38.175 --> 00:14:39.695
'cause even if somebody's doing the sales, guess what?

347
00:14:39.695 --> 00:14:42.215
Chief Revenue Officer, you gotta make those loan payments.

348
00:14:42.715 --> 00:14:44.055
You are in the business of selling.

349
00:14:44.355 --> 00:14:47.095
People will not buy from someone that they do not know,

350
00:14:47.605 --> 00:14:50.415
that they do not like, and that they do not trust.

351
00:14:51.265 --> 00:14:52.405
So when we know this,

352
00:14:52.475 --> 00:14:54.885
then we can think about when we're interacting with someone,

353
00:14:55.225 --> 00:14:57.405
how do I get them to know me, be be familiar

354
00:14:57.405 --> 00:14:58.405
with me in the first place?

355
00:14:59.465 --> 00:15:01.765
Do they like me? Am I being likable?

356
00:15:01.985 --> 00:15:04.725
And this isn't like, I don't talk about anything that, um,

357
00:15:05.125 --> 00:15:07.445
I don't believe that you should manipulate people or lie.

358
00:15:07.445 --> 00:15:10.085
Everything that I'm talking about is authenticity, right?

359
00:15:10.085 --> 00:15:11.245
Which comes down to trust.

360
00:15:11.625 --> 00:15:12.885
If you're not being authentic

361
00:15:13.545 --> 00:15:16.205
or if you have a a motive that you're not being clear about,

362
00:15:16.205 --> 00:15:18.205
people will automatically not trust you.

363
00:15:18.315 --> 00:15:19.445
They're not gonna buy you

364
00:15:20.345 --> 00:15:22.645
or choose you as the buyer if they don't trust you.

365
00:15:24.065 --> 00:15:28.655
So when all first time founders, uh,

366
00:15:29.195 --> 00:15:30.615
got this wrong, right?

367
00:15:30.675 --> 00:15:33.415
And I I did too until I understood this concept.

368
00:15:35.215 --> 00:15:37.315
As you, you know, think of yourself

369
00:15:37.375 --> 00:15:39.835
as this is a business enterprise that you're taking on,

370
00:15:40.055 --> 00:15:42.155
you are going through an exercise

371
00:15:42.155 --> 00:15:43.955
to become a business owner, whether you're starting one

372
00:15:43.955 --> 00:15:46.955
or buying one, there's still an element of thinking of

373
00:15:46.985 --> 00:15:49.115
what is my brand and how am I communicating

374
00:15:49.115 --> 00:15:50.195
that and how am I getting there?

375
00:15:51.775 --> 00:15:53.425
When new brands start out,

376
00:15:53.425 --> 00:15:55.305
they'll start talking about how great they are.

377
00:15:56.045 --> 00:15:58.905
And remember people are thinking, so what? It's like, cool.

378
00:15:58.905 --> 00:16:01.425
You're talking about how great you are. Like I don't care.

379
00:16:02.285 --> 00:16:05.905
Um, there's this amazing book called Building a Story Brand,

380
00:16:06.395 --> 00:16:10.705
which talks about the role you play in someone's world when

381
00:16:10.705 --> 00:16:11.865
you want them to be a customer,

382
00:16:11.895 --> 00:16:13.385
when you want them to buy from you.

383
00:16:14.135 --> 00:16:17.905
They are the hero and you are the guy, right?

384
00:16:18.285 --> 00:16:19.505
So think about Cinderella.

385
00:16:19.515 --> 00:16:22.745
Cinderella was trapped in her horrible house

386
00:16:22.745 --> 00:16:24.145
with her sisters and her mothers.

387
00:16:24.145 --> 00:16:25.305
They tore up a dress,

388
00:16:25.335 --> 00:16:26.945
they were making her do all these chores.

389
00:16:27.485 --> 00:16:29.105
She desperately wanted to get out.

390
00:16:29.605 --> 00:16:32.185
Um, and here shows this guide, right?

391
00:16:32.445 --> 00:16:35.985
And she's like, Hey, um, so I can bi bobby boo you,

392
00:16:36.445 --> 00:16:38.145
I'm gonna put you in this pumpkin over here.

393
00:16:38.325 --> 00:16:40.425
You're gonna go meet a man that's gonna change your life

394
00:16:40.425 --> 00:16:42.545
and you're gonna get out of this horrible situation.

395
00:16:43.995 --> 00:16:45.285
This guy had arrived

396
00:16:45.425 --> 00:16:48.325
and told her, told her how to get out of the horrible thing

397
00:16:48.465 --> 00:16:50.965
or get the success that she wanted, right?

398
00:16:51.145 --> 00:16:52.245
And I guarantee you,

399
00:16:52.425 --> 00:16:56.805
if the fairy godmother was selling the Bibo boo Cinderella

400
00:16:56.805 --> 00:16:59.245
would've been out there like auctioning off for mice friends

401
00:16:59.345 --> 00:17:01.845
for like animal testing to make it happen, right?

402
00:17:02.065 --> 00:17:04.485
So if you connect to what somebody wants

403
00:17:05.065 --> 00:17:06.805
and how you can help them do that,

404
00:17:07.155 --> 00:17:09.285
they're gonna do whatever it takes to get you there.

405
00:17:09.865 --> 00:17:12.005
So in this sense, obviously as a first time buyer,

406
00:17:12.005 --> 00:17:15.165
you're not the guide, but you are someone that could show up

407
00:17:15.545 --> 00:17:17.925
and help your hero get what they want.

408
00:17:18.185 --> 00:17:19.405
The owner that wants to make sure

409
00:17:19.405 --> 00:17:21.245
that their legacy is maintained.

410
00:17:21.545 --> 00:17:23.045
The broker that wants to make sure

411
00:17:23.045 --> 00:17:24.725
that their client is handed over to somebody

412
00:17:24.725 --> 00:17:26.965
that's gonna look after them and they're gonna get their fee

413
00:17:26.965 --> 00:17:30.965
after 12, 18, 24 months of working for free

414
00:17:31.065 --> 00:17:32.725
for this person, right?

415
00:17:33.025 --> 00:17:34.045
So think about that.

416
00:17:34.365 --> 00:17:35.485
Position yourself as the guide

417
00:17:35.505 --> 00:17:37.525
and how you're helping someone get what they want

418
00:17:38.025 --> 00:17:41.445
or avoid failure as opposed to you being the hero.

419
00:17:41.905 --> 00:17:44.205
And I can tell you what, if you do that in your life

420
00:17:44.345 --> 00:17:46.725
and in your business when you're doing marketing branding,

421
00:17:46.745 --> 00:17:47.885
it is such a shift.

422
00:17:49.965 --> 00:17:52.285
Additionally, you wanna think of the value perception

423
00:17:52.345 --> 00:17:54.085
of you or what you're selling.

424
00:17:54.265 --> 00:17:56.765
And in this case, you're selling yourself, right?

425
00:17:57.585 --> 00:18:01.205
So people want to buy what they perceive as having value.

426
00:18:02.025 --> 00:18:03.355
Well, what creates value?

427
00:18:03.715 --> 00:18:04.995
I stole this from Alex Hermo,

428
00:18:05.065 --> 00:18:07.795
this was in his a hundred million dollars offers book.

429
00:18:08.215 --> 00:18:10.995
The whole series is incredible, very great, uh,

430
00:18:11.045 --> 00:18:12.355
frameworks for businesses.

431
00:18:12.775 --> 00:18:14.835
The value equation is talking about

432
00:18:15.105 --> 00:18:16.435
what is someone's dream outcome.

433
00:18:16.505 --> 00:18:19.035
They want to, you know, sell a business.

434
00:18:19.095 --> 00:18:21.275
If we're talking about a broker, they wanna get that fee,

435
00:18:21.825 --> 00:18:23.555
then we multiply that by

436
00:18:23.555 --> 00:18:25.875
what is our perceived likelihood of achievement.

437
00:18:25.975 --> 00:18:28.595
So when a broker's thinking about who they're choosing,

438
00:18:28.625 --> 00:18:30.595
they're thinking about who's most likely

439
00:18:31.095 --> 00:18:33.515
to help me close on this business.

440
00:18:33.875 --> 00:18:36.275
I need to choose the right person that's gonna get me

441
00:18:36.545 --> 00:18:38.435
that achievement of my dream outcome.

442
00:18:38.655 --> 00:18:41.035
And then we divide that by the time it's gonna take

443
00:18:41.265 --> 00:18:43.115
that person to do it and the effort

444
00:18:43.135 --> 00:18:45.195
and sacrifice they're going to have to make.

445
00:18:45.255 --> 00:18:48.875
So as a first time buyer, you are adding time

446
00:18:49.275 --> 00:18:51.195
'cause you're figuring it out and you're adding

447
00:18:51.195 --> 00:18:52.235
effort and sacrifice.

448
00:18:52.395 --> 00:18:53.315
'cause they're gonna have to help you

449
00:18:53.315 --> 00:18:54.555
figure it out along the way.

450
00:18:54.905 --> 00:18:57.995
It's harder for them to work with someone like you

451
00:18:58.695 --> 00:19:00.835
and that's gonna lower your value

452
00:19:00.835 --> 00:19:04.395
because it's going to decrease their perceived likelihood

453
00:19:04.395 --> 00:19:07.165
of achievement, of getting their dream up, right?

454
00:19:07.425 --> 00:19:09.085
So when you're thinking about these things,

455
00:19:09.305 --> 00:19:12.085
how am I connecting to what their dream outcome is?

456
00:19:12.185 --> 00:19:13.245
How am I connecting to

457
00:19:13.245 --> 00:19:16.085
what their likelihood of achievement is?

458
00:19:16.085 --> 00:19:19.045
What that means, how they get their achievement?

459
00:19:19.185 --> 00:19:21.285
And then what is the things that, that I can do

460
00:19:21.285 --> 00:19:23.645
to decrease the time and effort

461
00:19:23.645 --> 00:19:25.885
and sacrifice of interacting with me?

462
00:19:25.885 --> 00:19:29.965
And that will increase your value. Okay?

463
00:19:30.185 --> 00:19:31.925
So we're talking about brand, right?

464
00:19:32.465 --> 00:19:34.285
And, and I do not think

465
00:19:34.285 --> 00:19:36.605
that a brand is your logo or whatever.

466
00:19:36.685 --> 00:19:37.725
I mean, obviously it's a component

467
00:19:37.725 --> 00:19:38.805
of it, it's your personality.

468
00:19:39.405 --> 00:19:40.855
I what many

469
00:19:41.035 --> 00:19:44.335
of you are doing is you're putting yourself out there

470
00:19:44.995 --> 00:19:49.255
and you look like everyone else, okay?

471
00:19:49.775 --> 00:19:52.295
I can rattle off your searcher website right now.

472
00:19:52.915 --> 00:19:54.815
We believe in honoring legacy

473
00:19:55.275 --> 00:19:56.975
and protecting what you've built.

474
00:19:57.395 --> 00:20:01.815
And we're looking for 500 K to 1 million in SDE

475
00:20:02.355 --> 00:20:05.095
stable and growing business in existence

476
00:20:05.095 --> 00:20:08.255
for at least 10 years in a like, stable or growing market.

477
00:20:08.565 --> 00:20:11.175
Like your criteria is all exactly the same.

478
00:20:11.915 --> 00:20:14.535
So when someone's going to buy a car, right?

479
00:20:14.535 --> 00:20:17.415
Like, here's a lot of the options right now when someone's

480
00:20:17.415 --> 00:20:19.775
going to pick a buyer out of the mix,

481
00:20:19.835 --> 00:20:23.255
if you're showing up like this, you're not standing out,

482
00:20:23.395 --> 00:20:24.535
you sound like everyone else,

483
00:20:24.585 --> 00:20:27.615
which in effect lowers your credibility, right?

484
00:20:27.615 --> 00:20:29.295
Because you're just cookie cutter,

485
00:20:29.325 --> 00:20:32.015
putting yourself out there with your, you know,

486
00:20:32.415 --> 00:20:34.935
whatever capital website and it looks, you know,

487
00:20:34.935 --> 00:20:37.895
and you got those like blue, blue and gray colors.

488
00:20:38.715 --> 00:20:41.965
And unfortunately it's not gonna help you.

489
00:20:42.145 --> 00:20:44.445
So when you're building a brand, you wanna think about like,

490
00:20:44.625 --> 00:20:48.585
how can I be the exotic car

491
00:20:49.445 --> 00:20:50.825
in this scenario, right?

492
00:20:51.005 --> 00:20:53.505
And it's not out of an authenticity.

493
00:20:53.525 --> 00:20:55.705
You need to be the right, this car isn't gonna be

494
00:20:55.705 --> 00:20:57.185
for everybody, right?

495
00:20:57.665 --> 00:21:00.145
I I, I wanna, I want a Barbie pink Jeep.

496
00:21:00.175 --> 00:21:01.505
Like that is the car I want.

497
00:21:01.535 --> 00:21:03.385
It's the dream car I've had since I was a kid.

498
00:21:03.465 --> 00:21:06.185
I want it someday. Not everybody's going

499
00:21:06.185 --> 00:21:07.465
to want a Barbie pink jeep.

500
00:21:07.485 --> 00:21:09.385
So you gotta be the right car for the right person.

501
00:21:10.005 --> 00:21:13.425
But the more you like, think about how am I standing out

502
00:21:13.425 --> 00:21:18.185
and being me and making myself unique so that when

503
00:21:18.185 --> 00:21:20.665
that person is like, ugh, that's that's the buyer

504
00:21:20.665 --> 00:21:22.345
that I want, that's the person I want

505
00:21:22.345 --> 00:21:23.385
taking over my business.

506
00:21:23.385 --> 00:21:26.265
That's the person I wanna work through with this,

507
00:21:26.285 --> 00:21:28.105
you're denying yourself that opportunity

508
00:21:28.445 --> 00:21:31.345
by putting yourself out there like everybody else out

509
00:21:31.345 --> 00:21:33.495
there, okay?

510
00:21:34.325 --> 00:21:36.865
How do we do this? First,

511
00:21:37.125 --> 00:21:39.705
before you build a brand, you gotta know your audience

512
00:21:39.725 --> 00:21:42.465
and who you're selling to, right?

513
00:21:42.535 --> 00:21:43.745
This is something that a lot

514
00:21:43.745 --> 00:21:45.265
of first time founders get wrong

515
00:21:45.285 --> 00:21:47.105
and something that a lot of people get wrong.

516
00:21:47.655 --> 00:21:51.545
They think of, okay, well what do I think will be good?

517
00:21:52.025 --> 00:21:54.545
It's like, well, you might not be your audience, right?

518
00:21:54.925 --> 00:21:58.145
So who are your audience you're dealing with, brokers,

519
00:21:58.295 --> 00:21:59.425
sellers, and lenders.

520
00:21:59.515 --> 00:22:01.385
These are, these are your stakeholders.

521
00:22:02.055 --> 00:22:05.545
What are their objections to you as a first time buyer?

522
00:22:06.085 --> 00:22:08.225
And what are you gonna do about it? Okay?

523
00:22:08.725 --> 00:22:13.025
So the first and biggest objection is, do they have money?

524
00:22:13.445 --> 00:22:15.505
Can they actually finance this deal?

525
00:22:16.805 --> 00:22:20.545
How you overcome that As a first time buyer, well go

526
00:22:20.565 --> 00:22:22.625
and get SBA prequalification.

527
00:22:23.365 --> 00:22:24.625
See if you can get someone to say

528
00:22:24.625 --> 00:22:26.185
what your buying power actually is

529
00:22:26.185 --> 00:22:28.865
and have a lender look at you and share that upfront.

530
00:22:30.065 --> 00:22:33.485
Do your homework. Know what your buying power actually is.

531
00:22:33.715 --> 00:22:35.125
Know how to structure it.

532
00:22:35.315 --> 00:22:37.645
This is where I really fell down on myself.

533
00:22:37.645 --> 00:22:41.245
I didn't know what I was doing or what my buying power was,

534
00:22:41.265 --> 00:22:42.845
and there wasn't anything out there at the time.

535
00:22:42.845 --> 00:22:44.405
There's tons of resources. Now.

536
00:22:44.835 --> 00:22:47.005
Have your personal financial statement ready

537
00:22:47.005 --> 00:22:48.725
to go and put in front of them.

538
00:22:48.905 --> 00:22:49.925
And if you're hiding that

539
00:22:49.925 --> 00:22:53.165
because you don't have any money, stop searching right now

540
00:22:53.165 --> 00:22:54.205
and go figure that out.

541
00:22:54.545 --> 00:22:56.645
If you don't have money to buy a business,

542
00:22:57.265 --> 00:22:58.765
you should not be buying a business.

543
00:22:58.985 --> 00:23:00.765
So either you need to figure out how

544
00:23:00.765 --> 00:23:03.285
to use other people's money and have that backing

545
00:23:03.285 --> 00:23:04.325
before you get into this.

546
00:23:04.865 --> 00:23:06.845
Or go and work, save up your money

547
00:23:06.985 --> 00:23:09.805
and come back when your balance sheet's gonna look better.

548
00:23:09.805 --> 00:23:13.065
Because I tell you what, it is not something

549
00:23:13.065 --> 00:23:14.545
that should be faked down the line

550
00:23:14.965 --> 00:23:17.505
and it is not something that you can figure out.

551
00:23:17.575 --> 00:23:18.825
Like go figure it out.

552
00:23:18.845 --> 00:23:21.345
And I know it's tough because people were being told you

553
00:23:21.345 --> 00:23:22.625
could buy a business with zero money,

554
00:23:23.125 --> 00:23:26.385
but honestly, I don't think it's a responsible thing to do.

555
00:23:26.725 --> 00:23:30.545
So have a real, real look at your money situation too.

556
00:23:31.205 --> 00:23:34.665
Um, the signal that you have overcome this objection is

557
00:23:34.665 --> 00:23:36.665
that brokers introduce you to their sellers

558
00:23:37.085 --> 00:23:39.785
and lenders get excited about working with you, right?

559
00:23:40.005 --> 00:23:41.385
So there's gonna be signals

560
00:23:41.385 --> 00:23:43.745
that we're gonna see when we overcome those objections.

561
00:23:43.925 --> 00:23:45.605
And I've just picked a few to go over.

562
00:23:45.605 --> 00:23:48.805
There's clearly a million, but these are the main ones.

563
00:23:49.545 --> 00:23:53.005
The next objection that people have is, is this person going

564
00:23:53.005 --> 00:23:54.005
to get it to the finish line?

565
00:23:54.025 --> 00:23:56.325
Do they have what it takes? And I can tell you what,

566
00:23:57.265 --> 00:24:01.125
you are gonna be tested unlike anything probably

567
00:24:01.125 --> 00:24:02.885
that you've done in your life when you try

568
00:24:02.885 --> 00:24:04.085
to buy a business, right?

569
00:24:04.145 --> 00:24:05.845
You listen to all of those episodes.

570
00:24:05.845 --> 00:24:08.805
There's, there's challenges that comes up so often

571
00:24:09.345 --> 00:24:10.805
and you're staring down the barrel

572
00:24:11.025 --> 00:24:13.285
of a multimillion dollar personal guarantee

573
00:24:13.285 --> 00:24:15.005
and potentially bankrupting yourself

574
00:24:15.005 --> 00:24:16.285
and losing your family home.

575
00:24:16.345 --> 00:24:17.365
If you don't get this right,

576
00:24:17.595 --> 00:24:19.325
your demons are gonna come up, right?

577
00:24:19.505 --> 00:24:21.565
And oftentimes it's those demons

578
00:24:21.835 --> 00:24:24.085
that stop the deal from going forward

579
00:24:24.115 --> 00:24:25.365
when you're a first time buyer.

580
00:24:25.785 --> 00:24:27.925
So you are being vetted through that lens.

581
00:24:28.075 --> 00:24:29.685
They wanna see if you have the grit

582
00:24:29.685 --> 00:24:33.085
and resiliency it's gonna take to get a deal done.

583
00:24:33.345 --> 00:24:36.205
And that will also tell them whether you have the grit

584
00:24:36.205 --> 00:24:38.205
and resiliency it takes to be a business owner.

585
00:24:38.765 --> 00:24:40.045
'cause I can tell you right now

586
00:24:40.355 --> 00:24:43.085
that having a W2 is like being on vacation.

587
00:24:43.605 --> 00:24:47.125
A paycheck just shows up in your account every month, right?

588
00:24:47.355 --> 00:24:49.565
That is not a luxury you get as a business owner

589
00:24:49.825 --> 00:24:51.205
and all of the decisions in

590
00:24:51.205 --> 00:24:53.765
that business is on you as a business owner.

591
00:24:54.115 --> 00:24:56.525
It's a crazy thing to wanna be a business owner

592
00:24:56.545 --> 00:24:59.445
and be like, take responsibility for all

593
00:24:59.565 --> 00:25:00.845
of these people's livelihood

594
00:25:00.865 --> 00:25:02.845
and make sure that I'm making the right decisions

595
00:25:02.845 --> 00:25:04.045
every day to make that happen.

596
00:25:04.555 --> 00:25:05.565
It's terrifying.

597
00:25:05.715 --> 00:25:08.205
There's nothing wrong with being in a W2

598
00:25:08.225 --> 00:25:09.285
and earning a paycheck.

599
00:25:09.315 --> 00:25:11.685
It's a wonderful relaxed life.

600
00:25:12.365 --> 00:25:13.605
Business ownership is not relaxed.

601
00:25:13.865 --> 00:25:15.725
So if you think it's just like buy a business

602
00:25:15.725 --> 00:25:18.445
and have someone else operate it, no sir,

603
00:25:19.065 --> 00:25:20.125
it does not happen that way.

604
00:25:20.265 --> 00:25:22.285
So anyways, they're, they know that, right?

605
00:25:22.285 --> 00:25:24.165
And they've seen a bunch of people come show up,

606
00:25:24.165 --> 00:25:25.685
think it's gonna be easy, they

607
00:25:25.685 --> 00:25:26.845
don't get it to the finish line.

608
00:25:26.905 --> 00:25:30.125
So when you wanna overcome that objection first,

609
00:25:31.285 --> 00:25:34.965
communicating clearly and quickly, if they are asking you

610
00:25:34.965 --> 00:25:37.085
for something, get it back to them as soon as possible.

611
00:25:37.145 --> 00:25:39.405
You always wanna be putting the ball in their court,

612
00:25:39.735 --> 00:25:41.725
which shows that you will have momentum

613
00:25:41.985 --> 00:25:43.805
and you will prioritize this.

614
00:25:44.235 --> 00:25:47.245
Corporate time and deal time are two totally

615
00:25:47.245 --> 00:25:48.285
different timelines.

616
00:25:48.465 --> 00:25:50.925
So get out of corporate time, get into deal time,

617
00:25:51.025 --> 00:25:53.005
and it signals to somebody that you care

618
00:25:53.105 --> 00:25:56.645
and that you're gonna do what takes when you are responding

619
00:25:56.645 --> 00:25:58.165
quickly and getting back to them quicker

620
00:25:58.165 --> 00:25:59.285
than they're getting back to you.

621
00:26:00.165 --> 00:26:02.805
I like it when somebody always has the ball in their court

622
00:26:02.805 --> 00:26:04.645
because it means like I'm lobbing it back.

623
00:26:04.865 --> 00:26:06.525
I'm not, they're not waiting on me.

624
00:26:07.825 --> 00:26:10.365
You wanna read the room with eq? Okay?

625
00:26:10.635 --> 00:26:14.995
Just knowing how a deal is done is not going

626
00:26:14.995 --> 00:26:16.275
to get you over the finish line.

627
00:26:16.275 --> 00:26:19.235
There's so much rapport, relationship building EQ

628
00:26:19.265 --> 00:26:20.795
that is required to do this.

629
00:26:20.795 --> 00:26:23.235
Well, so much so

630
00:26:23.235 --> 00:26:25.915
that we're gonna do a whole other series on this on

631
00:26:25.915 --> 00:26:27.995
October 9th and talking about this,

632
00:26:27.995 --> 00:26:30.275
because honestly, it's the thing I spend the most time

633
00:26:30.275 --> 00:26:32.715
with the clients on is how to do that.

634
00:26:33.215 --> 00:26:37.235
How to do it right? You can tell a story of persistence,

635
00:26:38.025 --> 00:26:41.595
something you overcame, grit that you had to get them

636
00:26:41.595 --> 00:26:42.715
to buy into you, okay?

637
00:26:42.715 --> 00:26:44.645
Maybe you haven't been a business owner before,

638
00:26:44.665 --> 00:26:46.845
but what's your hero's story?

639
00:26:46.915 --> 00:26:48.245
What did you overcome? What's

640
00:26:48.245 --> 00:26:49.605
gonna demonstrate that you have grit?

641
00:26:50.045 --> 00:26:52.085
I can tell you what I ha I I,

642
00:26:52.205 --> 00:26:54.685
I don't think anybody else has raised $3 million in five

643
00:26:54.685 --> 00:26:56.675
days to buy a business.

644
00:26:57.775 --> 00:27:00.985
When I did that, like the, everybody was like, God,

645
00:27:01.005 --> 00:27:02.745
if you did that, like what are you gonna do

646
00:27:02.745 --> 00:27:04.025
as a business owner, right?

647
00:27:04.055 --> 00:27:05.305
Like it showed that I fought

648
00:27:05.645 --> 00:27:07.705
and I have all sorts of, like, one

649
00:27:07.705 --> 00:27:10.105
of my favorite things is a phoenix rising from the ashes.

650
00:27:10.175 --> 00:27:12.625
Like I will pick myself back up again.

651
00:27:12.985 --> 00:27:15.185
I will face challenges head on.

652
00:27:15.245 --> 00:27:16.665
I'm a buffalo, I run into the storm.

653
00:27:16.685 --> 00:27:18.625
I'm not a cow, I don't run away from it, right?

654
00:27:19.485 --> 00:27:21.265
Um, and get the right team

655
00:27:21.265 --> 00:27:24.705
and advisors run, buy, borrow credibility where you need it

656
00:27:24.805 --> 00:27:27.105
and understand where your limitations are.

657
00:27:27.405 --> 00:27:29.865
Buying a business is a completely different skillset

658
00:27:30.085 --> 00:27:31.145
to owning a business.

659
00:27:31.645 --> 00:27:32.865
And it, unless you're wanting

660
00:27:32.865 --> 00:27:35.665
to do this multiple times over, then get the right people

661
00:27:35.665 --> 00:27:37.945
around you who can help you get the win.

662
00:27:38.165 --> 00:27:39.945
And that signals credibility.

663
00:27:40.005 --> 00:27:41.505
It signals that you have skin in the game.

664
00:27:41.505 --> 00:27:43.785
It signals that you're serious to the stakeholders.

665
00:27:44.365 --> 00:27:46.905
Um, and the signal that you are helping that,

666
00:27:46.905 --> 00:27:48.505
that people think that you have what it takes

667
00:27:48.505 --> 00:27:50.785
to get it over the line is they start making

668
00:27:50.885 --> 00:27:52.025
effort to help you.

669
00:27:53.145 --> 00:27:56.875
That broker gave me time to go raise 3 million.

670
00:27:57.275 --> 00:28:00.155
I can't imagine being on the other end of that phone call

671
00:28:00.175 --> 00:28:03.155
and this girl's just like, Hey, so can I make some time

672
00:28:03.175 --> 00:28:04.555
to go raise $3 million?

673
00:28:04.695 --> 00:28:05.875
And he is like, what?

674
00:28:06.065 --> 00:28:09.385
Like, and he actually gave me time, you know,

675
00:28:09.565 --> 00:28:11.345
so when they start making effort

676
00:28:11.365 --> 00:28:13.105
to help you, they believe in you.

677
00:28:13.415 --> 00:28:16.225
They believe in what you can achieve, they're excited

678
00:28:16.345 --> 00:28:17.625
to be involved, right?

679
00:28:18.405 --> 00:28:21.305
And then the last objection I'm gonna touch on today is,

680
00:28:21.375 --> 00:28:25.075
will they make a good owner leading

681
00:28:25.075 --> 00:28:26.675
with your values in conversation,

682
00:28:26.745 --> 00:28:29.155
talking about why ownership matters to you,

683
00:28:29.885 --> 00:28:32.595
connecting yourself to the business that you're looking at.

684
00:28:32.715 --> 00:28:34.955
I can't tell you how many brokers are like, what?

685
00:28:35.375 --> 00:28:36.835
Why do you want this business?

686
00:28:36.835 --> 00:28:39.035
Like you're in tech and you're looking at landscaping.

687
00:28:39.305 --> 00:28:43.635
There's, there's, I think this like, uh, gen Z like,

688
00:28:44.185 --> 00:28:47.315
like vibe buying businesses or vibe coding

689
00:28:47.455 --> 00:28:48.955
or whatever, like vibe thing.

690
00:28:48.955 --> 00:28:49.955
Like you just get a vibe

691
00:28:49.955 --> 00:28:51.915
and you wanna like buy I I'm not using it well

692
00:28:52.035 --> 00:28:54.235
'cause I am, I'm an elder millennial.

693
00:28:54.515 --> 00:28:56.555
Um, almost, almost x.

694
00:28:56.975 --> 00:29:01.275
Um, so yeah, but like there's a lot of vibe buyers out there

695
00:29:01.335 --> 00:29:02.755
and it's like, well, why do you actually

696
00:29:02.755 --> 00:29:03.915
wanna buy this business?

697
00:29:04.375 --> 00:29:05.715
So you need to connect yourself

698
00:29:05.715 --> 00:29:08.155
to the business even if you don't have relevant experience.

699
00:29:08.185 --> 00:29:11.875
What about you is going to be relevant for this business?

700
00:29:11.875 --> 00:29:13.915
What's gonna make you a good owner of that business

701
00:29:14.415 --> 00:29:17.795
and truly audit and understand why you'll be a good owner?

702
00:29:19.605 --> 00:29:21.615
Look, not everyone should be a business owner,

703
00:29:22.505 --> 00:29:26.565
and I think you really wanna get real with yourself.

704
00:29:26.745 --> 00:29:29.525
As I mentioned in the previous, it is, it is tough, right?

705
00:29:29.705 --> 00:29:33.245
All your demons come out, all your weaknesses are shown

706
00:29:33.245 --> 00:29:34.325
to you on a daily basis.

707
00:29:34.465 --> 00:29:36.565
It is tough. It is really hard to keep going.

708
00:29:37.665 --> 00:29:39.805
You need to understand what's gonna make you a good business

709
00:29:39.805 --> 00:29:41.765
owner and be able to communicate that.

710
00:29:42.025 --> 00:29:44.645
And if you feel like you're not quite there, go out

711
00:29:44.645 --> 00:29:46.965
and get the skills and experience to help you get there.

712
00:29:47.875 --> 00:29:50.565
Show consistency and professional presence.

713
00:29:51.565 --> 00:29:54.265
So like, if you're talking about being a business buyer

714
00:29:54.645 --> 00:29:55.665
and I go to your LinkedIn

715
00:29:55.665 --> 00:29:58.665
and all I see is you talking about being an amazing tech

716
00:29:58.945 --> 00:30:00.545
salesman, there's a disconnect.

717
00:30:00.685 --> 00:30:02.825
So now I'm like distrusting of your brand

718
00:30:02.825 --> 00:30:04.625
because there's not consistency.

719
00:30:05.485 --> 00:30:06.785
Um, how you show up

720
00:30:06.785 --> 00:30:10.105
and interact with people also makes an impression, right?

721
00:30:10.325 --> 00:30:13.985
So as a business owner, how you interact with people,

722
00:30:14.095 --> 00:30:17.665
your team, customers, et cetera, like you're being vetted

723
00:30:18.205 --> 00:30:20.345
on your interactions with people.

724
00:30:20.765 --> 00:30:22.665
And then the last thing is like really start

725
00:30:22.665 --> 00:30:24.145
obsessing about business ownership.

726
00:30:24.465 --> 00:30:26.425
I get really scared at how many people

727
00:30:26.425 --> 00:30:28.625
that have never been a business owner are trying

728
00:30:28.625 --> 00:30:32.685
to buy a business and are not just learning about how

729
00:30:32.685 --> 00:30:34.725
to buy a business, but they're not learning about

730
00:30:34.725 --> 00:30:35.845
how to be a business owner.

731
00:30:36.185 --> 00:30:39.405
And I tell you what, like you got a bunch of great advisors

732
00:30:39.405 --> 00:30:41.005
around you getting it over the finish line,

733
00:30:41.005 --> 00:30:43.165
and then you become a business owner and you're on your own.

734
00:30:43.165 --> 00:30:45.445
You're on an island trying to figure it out.

735
00:30:45.585 --> 00:30:46.605
So start learning

736
00:30:46.785 --> 00:30:48.925
and better yet, go work in a small business.

737
00:30:49.725 --> 00:30:52.425
You want landscaping, go, go be a landscaper for a day.

738
00:30:52.925 --> 00:30:56.025
Um, that'll give you a hell of a lot of credibility

739
00:30:56.055 --> 00:30:58.265
with the stakeholders that you're actually taking those

740
00:30:58.265 --> 00:31:01.585
opportunities to, to try it out before try before you buy.

741
00:31:02.165 --> 00:31:04.265
Um, so the signal that this is working

742
00:31:04.265 --> 00:31:05.865
that people think you're a good owner is

743
00:31:05.865 --> 00:31:07.705
that sellers talk about you as the buyer.

744
00:31:07.705 --> 00:31:08.865
They can see running their company.

745
00:31:09.445 --> 00:31:12.225
Um, brokers tell you that the sellers like you,

746
00:31:12.405 --> 00:31:14.305
the lenders wanna back, right?

747
00:31:14.415 --> 00:31:18.555
Like it's the J curve is real.

748
00:31:19.105 --> 00:31:20.435
It's real that people will take

749
00:31:20.435 --> 00:31:21.795
the business after they buy it.

750
00:31:21.905 --> 00:31:23.755
There's so much challenges that come up.

751
00:31:23.935 --> 00:31:27.835
So like making people believe that you're gonna be okay

752
00:31:27.865 --> 00:31:30.315
with all of that after the transaction is really important.

753
00:31:31.395 --> 00:31:33.765
Okay, real quick, I'm gonna whistle stop

754
00:31:33.765 --> 00:31:35.765
to our turning weaknesses into strengths.

755
00:31:35.865 --> 00:31:39.625
So you're, I I tell this to my clients all the time,

756
00:31:39.815 --> 00:31:41.745
your weaknesses are actually your strengths.

757
00:31:41.745 --> 00:31:43.745
There's always a way to reframe it, right?

758
00:31:43.765 --> 00:31:46.305
People like supporting the Davids people

759
00:31:46.495 --> 00:31:48.185
like cheering the little guy on.

760
00:31:48.325 --> 00:31:51.545
So you can think of, well, let's, let me real with

761
00:31:51.545 --> 00:31:53.985
what my weaknesses are and how do I turn 'em into strengths?

762
00:31:54.855 --> 00:31:56.945
This is not something you can turn into a strength, right?

763
00:31:56.975 --> 00:32:01.705
Rule number one is don't be rude to people.

764
00:32:02.115 --> 00:32:04.905
Don't be an a*****e.

765
00:32:06.325 --> 00:32:07.505
We turn clients away.

766
00:32:07.645 --> 00:32:10.585
If people are rude to us, lenders will turn you away.

767
00:32:10.645 --> 00:32:12.265
The brokers don't wanna deal with you.

768
00:32:12.905 --> 00:32:15.825
I can put the most amazing business in front of you

769
00:32:15.845 --> 00:32:17.305
and have you become the business owner.

770
00:32:17.325 --> 00:32:20.305
And if you're rude to people, you'll ruin that business.

771
00:32:20.485 --> 00:32:23.665
People don't wanna work for someone that's mean to them.

772
00:32:24.065 --> 00:32:25.865
Customers don't wanna interact with someone that's mean.

773
00:32:26.205 --> 00:32:29.705
So kindness is something you can do for free.

774
00:32:29.845 --> 00:32:31.145
And this is something that I think

775
00:32:31.405 --> 00:32:34.425
as a whole country we need to think about, right?

776
00:32:34.425 --> 00:32:37.025
Like if you're riding people and tailgating them

777
00:32:37.025 --> 00:32:39.025
and honking at them and being mean to 'em,

778
00:32:39.035 --> 00:32:40.765
like you're showing up that way.

779
00:32:40.865 --> 00:32:44.005
And if you have all that anger, stop searching,

780
00:32:44.345 --> 00:32:47.645
go get a therapist, heal yourself, right?

781
00:32:47.665 --> 00:32:49.485
And it comes up, we have triggers.

782
00:32:49.845 --> 00:32:50.885
I have a business therapist.

783
00:32:51.005 --> 00:32:52.845
I think everybody should as a business owner,

784
00:32:52.875 --> 00:32:54.165
like you're gonna be tested.

785
00:32:54.785 --> 00:32:56.925
But if you automatically just show up

786
00:32:56.925 --> 00:32:59.125
and you're rude to people, you need to go deal with

787
00:32:59.125 --> 00:33:01.645
that first before you look at business ownership.

788
00:33:01.645 --> 00:33:03.885
Because it doesn't matter how good the business is,

789
00:33:03.885 --> 00:33:05.045
you're not gonna do well with it

790
00:33:06.505 --> 00:33:07.845
and people aren't gonna wanna work with you.

791
00:33:08.005 --> 00:33:09.645
I was just on the phone with a lender the other day

792
00:33:09.645 --> 00:33:11.245
and he is like, Nope, won't touch 'em.

793
00:33:11.245 --> 00:33:14.885
Like, we won't either. So you're not gonna get very far if

794
00:33:14.885 --> 00:33:15.925
you're not nice to people.

795
00:33:16.705 --> 00:33:18.805
Um, it's okay to be industry agnostic,

796
00:33:18.805 --> 00:33:20.645
but you need to stand for something, right?

797
00:33:20.825 --> 00:33:23.885
So something that I used when I was going

798
00:33:23.885 --> 00:33:27.845
through my search journey was my parents' story of, um,

799
00:33:28.115 --> 00:33:29.645
they were business owners.

800
00:33:29.985 --> 00:33:32.245
Um, they had a really successful construction management

801
00:33:32.265 --> 00:33:33.525
and construction business.

802
00:33:33.755 --> 00:33:35.885
When they wanted to retire, they shut it down.

803
00:33:36.515 --> 00:33:39.565
Then after that, my dad had a heart attack. He's okay.

804
00:33:39.865 --> 00:33:42.285
Um, but they were out of the country.

805
00:33:42.425 --> 00:33:43.605
So they ended up spending a lot

806
00:33:43.705 --> 00:33:45.965
of their nest egg on medical expenses.

807
00:33:46.025 --> 00:33:48.765
And now that nest egg isn't, isn't so plentiful

808
00:33:49.265 --> 00:33:50.525
and knowing what I do now,

809
00:33:50.995 --> 00:33:52.445
they could have sold their business.

810
00:33:53.345 --> 00:33:56.325
Um, so when I was looking at businesses, I wasn't sure

811
00:33:56.325 --> 00:33:57.325
what I wanted to look at,

812
00:33:57.385 --> 00:33:59.165
but I knew what was important to me was,

813
00:33:59.385 --> 00:34:01.485
was taking over something from somebody

814
00:34:01.485 --> 00:34:04.565
and helping them get rewarded for all the hard work

815
00:34:04.565 --> 00:34:05.565
that they put into it.

816
00:34:05.705 --> 00:34:08.045
And me doing it justice as the new owner.

817
00:34:08.425 --> 00:34:11.165
And I told owners my story

818
00:34:11.345 --> 00:34:13.445
and that connected them to me authentically.

819
00:34:13.445 --> 00:34:16.845
It wasn't, wasn't, wasn't not real. It was 100% real.

820
00:34:16.865 --> 00:34:19.325
And I'm so angry I didn't know about all this sooner

821
00:34:19.745 --> 00:34:21.005
to help my parents, right?

822
00:34:21.665 --> 00:34:23.885
Um, this is a big one.

823
00:34:23.885 --> 00:34:26.205
Like, do not pretend you know more than you do.

824
00:34:26.905 --> 00:34:28.245
And I'm looking at you people

825
00:34:28.245 --> 00:34:29.885
that are setting up your like capital

826
00:34:30.185 --> 00:34:33.005
or ventures, companies, you know,

827
00:34:33.125 --> 00:34:34.245
websites, that sort of thing.

828
00:34:34.245 --> 00:34:36.045
And ha, hands up. I did it too.

829
00:34:36.885 --> 00:34:39.645
I, unrestricted ventures was like my thing

830
00:34:39.785 --> 00:34:40.965
and it did me a disservice

831
00:34:40.965 --> 00:34:42.965
because they were like, so who are your investors?

832
00:34:43.105 --> 00:34:44.725
What's your fund? Dah, dah, dah, dah.

833
00:34:44.725 --> 00:34:46.365
Like, I wasn't a fund, I was a person.

834
00:34:46.705 --> 00:34:50.605
So, you know, like, I get it. You feel outta your depth.

835
00:34:51.025 --> 00:34:53.565
You feel like you need to show up like a, like a expert.

836
00:34:53.665 --> 00:34:55.165
And honestly it does even a disservice

837
00:34:55.165 --> 00:34:56.645
because when they start digging into it

838
00:34:56.645 --> 00:34:57.845
and you don't know what you're talking about,

839
00:34:57.845 --> 00:35:00.445
it makes them trust you even less as opposed to like,

840
00:35:00.465 --> 00:35:01.765
hi, I'm Athena.

841
00:35:01.985 --> 00:35:05.765
Um, I am a multiple, you know, founder, business consultant.

842
00:35:05.965 --> 00:35:07.685
I love being a business owner

843
00:35:07.865 --> 00:35:09.205
and I wanna be a business owner.

844
00:35:09.385 --> 00:35:12.205
And I'm, you know, first time doing this so

845
00:35:13.155 --> 00:35:14.525
that people can get behind

846
00:35:14.525 --> 00:35:16.245
because it's like, okay, you're being real with

847
00:35:16.245 --> 00:35:17.285
where you're at, but like, hey,

848
00:35:17.285 --> 00:35:18.445
here's what I'm doing about it.

849
00:35:18.585 --> 00:35:20.325
I'm learning. I'm getting the right advisors,

850
00:35:20.465 --> 00:35:22.445
I'm doing everything I can to make this

851
00:35:22.445 --> 00:35:23.725
as easy as possible for you.

852
00:35:23.995 --> 00:35:26.125
It's okay to admit when you don't know what you're doing.

853
00:35:26.185 --> 00:35:27.845
And actually the best business owners

854
00:35:27.985 --> 00:35:29.125
are the ones that do that.

855
00:35:29.985 --> 00:35:31.565
Um, okay,

856
00:35:32.225 --> 00:35:35.205
I'm big on pattern interruption if you couldn't already tell

857
00:35:35.265 --> 00:35:37.885
by like the leopard print in the background and the pink.

858
00:35:38.385 --> 00:35:42.405
Um, so when I lived in London for 10 years,

859
00:35:42.685 --> 00:35:44.365
I dealt a lot in the finance industry.

860
00:35:44.705 --> 00:35:46.805
We all were black and we were miserable there.

861
00:35:47.225 --> 00:35:49.085
And as I was leaving London, I was like, man,

862
00:35:49.285 --> 00:35:50.845
I don't even have any light left in me.

863
00:35:50.905 --> 00:35:53.245
I'm never dimming my light for anyone again.

864
00:35:54.445 --> 00:35:57.605
I choose to dress this way. This stuff makes me happy.

865
00:35:57.865 --> 00:36:01.085
I'm not doing it to, to get a reaction out of people,

866
00:36:01.155 --> 00:36:02.725
it's just what makes me feel good.

867
00:36:03.585 --> 00:36:07.085
Not everybody's going to like somebody that has a bunch

868
00:36:07.085 --> 00:36:10.885
of big cats behind her and wears leopard print and, um,

869
00:36:12.825 --> 00:36:16.325
but you make yourself a magnet when you are authentically

870
00:36:16.345 --> 00:36:18.285
you and you choose whatever it is

871
00:36:18.285 --> 00:36:20.125
that's a pattern interrupt, right?

872
00:36:20.585 --> 00:36:25.565
In the sea of blue websites of, you know,

873
00:36:26.125 --> 00:36:27.325
buy-side advisors.

874
00:36:27.435 --> 00:36:29.485
Like here we are in pink and leopard print.

875
00:36:29.485 --> 00:36:31.725
Like it's intentional. We call ourselves acquisition

876
00:36:31.725 --> 00:36:33.565
matchmakers intentional, right?

877
00:36:33.805 --> 00:36:35.085
I wanna be a pattern interrupt

878
00:36:35.085 --> 00:36:36.565
because we are not like everybody else,

879
00:36:36.575 --> 00:36:38.765
which means I'm going to attract people

880
00:36:38.765 --> 00:36:41.445
that are interested in what we do and how we work,

881
00:36:41.705 --> 00:36:43.805
and I'm gonna repel people that are not my people.

882
00:36:45.425 --> 00:36:46.735
Quick story for you. Right

883
00:36:46.735 --> 00:36:48.855
after I raised that 3 million, I was like, that was awesome,

884
00:36:48.975 --> 00:36:49.975
I wanna do that again.

885
00:36:50.155 --> 00:36:52.975
And I got really excited about independent sponsor models.

886
00:36:53.485 --> 00:36:55.735
Went to the independent sponsor conference, knew

887
00:36:55.735 --> 00:36:56.895
that there was gonna be a whole bunch

888
00:36:56.895 --> 00:36:59.615
of finance people there, thousands in fact.

889
00:37:00.035 --> 00:37:01.775
And from my days in London, I was like,

890
00:37:01.775 --> 00:37:04.135
it's probably gonna be blazers and sport coats and blue

891
00:37:04.135 --> 00:37:05.215
and black and blah.

892
00:37:05.565 --> 00:37:09.415
It's like, okay, I showed up in leopard print dress

893
00:37:09.755 --> 00:37:11.295
and rhinestone cowboy boots.

894
00:37:12.525 --> 00:37:15.585
Did a lot of people not take me seriously? Absolutely did.

895
00:37:15.585 --> 00:37:17.105
A lot of people come over to me

896
00:37:17.105 --> 00:37:18.225
and they're like, you're different.

897
00:37:18.285 --> 00:37:19.585
What's your story? I'm like,

898
00:37:19.705 --> 00:37:21.505
I just raised $3 million in five days.

899
00:37:21.505 --> 00:37:22.505
They're like, tell me more.

900
00:37:23.505 --> 00:37:24.785
I walked away with so many people

901
00:37:24.785 --> 00:37:26.065
that were like, you're awesome.

902
00:37:26.265 --> 00:37:27.905
I wanna back you when you get a deal.

903
00:37:28.165 --> 00:37:29.505
Please come and talk to me.

904
00:37:29.875 --> 00:37:32.145
Those people have given me a ton of time and advisory

905
00:37:32.365 --> 00:37:34.385
and actually been amazing support

906
00:37:34.405 --> 00:37:35.905
to my clients as a result of that.

907
00:37:36.305 --> 00:37:38.705
I attracted people that were interested in me.

908
00:37:38.865 --> 00:37:41.465
I repelled people that were like, ugh, that print.

909
00:37:41.495 --> 00:37:44.905
Like, okay, um, not my kind of person.

910
00:37:45.165 --> 00:37:47.025
You know, I like injecting fun.

911
00:37:47.165 --> 00:37:49.225
One of our values is the joy in the journey.

912
00:37:49.445 --> 00:37:53.105
So, um, that's all to say is like, be yourself,

913
00:37:53.125 --> 00:37:54.425
but authentically yourself.

914
00:37:54.445 --> 00:37:55.825
And don't be worried about looking

915
00:37:55.825 --> 00:37:56.905
differently than everybody else.

916
00:37:57.405 --> 00:37:59.905
We all know, um, Jared Johnson, right?

917
00:38:00.335 --> 00:38:02.545
He's first internet bank, SBA lender

918
00:38:02.545 --> 00:38:04.145
because he has a big cowboy hat on.

919
00:38:04.245 --> 00:38:06.505
You see him at every event, you know who he is.

920
00:38:07.125 --> 00:38:08.665
Um, that's a pattern interruption.

921
00:38:08.665 --> 00:38:11.625
It's okay to do that, but make it authentic to you.

922
00:38:13.015 --> 00:38:15.395
Um, you're not a fund. That's a good thing.

923
00:38:15.625 --> 00:38:17.075
Your weakness is your strength.

924
00:38:17.095 --> 00:38:19.355
And I can't tell you how many of my clients are chosen,

925
00:38:19.425 --> 00:38:22.875
even though their, uh, offers are less money

926
00:38:23.345 --> 00:38:26.075
because they are an amazing person

927
00:38:26.075 --> 00:38:28.915
because they engaged with them authentically

928
00:38:28.915 --> 00:38:31.275
because that owner wants them to be the owner,

929
00:38:31.455 --> 00:38:33.875
not the a*****e PE guys, right?

930
00:38:34.465 --> 00:38:36.205
It's a good thing that you're not a fund.

931
00:38:36.275 --> 00:38:39.165
It's a good thing that you're not a, like private equity

932
00:38:39.345 --> 00:38:40.765
and experienced investors.

933
00:38:41.025 --> 00:38:43.205
That's what these owners want to take over.

934
00:38:44.345 --> 00:38:46.605
So put yourself out there as a buyer

935
00:38:46.865 --> 00:38:50.125
and tell everybody, a lot of you are in hiding, right?

936
00:38:50.385 --> 00:38:53.325
You have a lot of real estate on your email signatures,

937
00:38:53.605 --> 00:38:55.125
LinkedIns when you're talking to people.

938
00:38:55.425 --> 00:38:57.765
The way I was able to raise money that quickly was

939
00:38:57.765 --> 00:38:59.365
because I was literally, as soon

940
00:38:59.365 --> 00:39:00.565
as I found out about business buying,

941
00:39:00.925 --> 00:39:02.645
I couldn't shut up about it.

942
00:39:02.755 --> 00:39:03.965
Like, I don't care

943
00:39:03.965 --> 00:39:05.525
who you were, I was talking to you about it.

944
00:39:05.585 --> 00:39:07.365
And then I had a bunch of people that were interested

945
00:39:07.635 --> 00:39:09.725
that I remember and I was like, I'm gonna go back to them.

946
00:39:10.075 --> 00:39:12.605
Tell everyone, you never know what can happen,

947
00:39:12.705 --> 00:39:14.205
but if you're not telling anyone,

948
00:39:14.745 --> 00:39:16.325
are you really serious about this?

949
00:39:16.825 --> 00:39:21.125
So remember this, if nothing else, when you interact

950
00:39:21.125 --> 00:39:23.085
with people, when you send 'em a message,

951
00:39:23.235 --> 00:39:25.485
when you have a conversation with them, when you put a piece

952
00:39:25.485 --> 00:39:28.285
of marketing material out there, what do you want people

953
00:39:28.285 --> 00:39:31.335
to think as a result of receiving that?

954
00:39:31.645 --> 00:39:32.895
What do you want them to feel

955
00:39:33.275 --> 00:39:35.575
and what do you want them to do once they get that?

956
00:39:35.725 --> 00:39:39.535
Okay? So for this webinar, I want people to think, wow,

957
00:39:39.935 --> 00:39:44.215
I didn't realize I could be myself and be effective in this.

958
00:39:44.295 --> 00:39:47.015
I want them to feel relieved and excited

959
00:39:47.395 --> 00:39:48.695
and ready to go out there

960
00:39:48.955 --> 00:39:51.215
and put it out there that you're gonna be a buyer

961
00:39:51.635 --> 00:39:54.135
and I want you to become a business owner.

962
00:39:54.255 --> 00:39:55.335
I want you to do the things

963
00:39:55.335 --> 00:39:56.895
that are gonna help you be a business owner

964
00:39:57.035 --> 00:39:58.535
as a result of this, right?

965
00:39:58.635 --> 00:40:00.575
So when you're thinking about what do I want people

966
00:40:00.575 --> 00:40:04.135
to think, feel, and do, then it makes you more measured and,

967
00:40:04.235 --> 00:40:05.335
and, and clear

968
00:40:05.475 --> 00:40:07.815
and consistent in how you're interacting with people.

969
00:40:08.475 --> 00:40:11.015
And lastly, you can borrow credibility, right?

970
00:40:11.145 --> 00:40:15.335
Build a team to overcome your weaknesses. My team included.

971
00:40:16.245 --> 00:40:18.335
When we reach out to brokers and

972
00:40:18.355 --> 00:40:20.295
and lenders on behalf of one of our buyers,

973
00:40:20.685 --> 00:40:21.895
it's instant credibility.

974
00:40:22.115 --> 00:40:24.575
Um, so there's a bunch of great people out there.

975
00:40:24.675 --> 00:40:27.255
You leopard print and paint might not be your flavor.

976
00:40:27.275 --> 00:40:29.415
That's cool. There's some other ones that have the blue

977
00:40:29.415 --> 00:40:33.485
that you might like real quick in the brand toolkit, uh,

978
00:40:33.635 --> 00:40:34.925
what should be in the brand toolkit.

979
00:40:35.195 --> 00:40:39.845
This is like minimum, have a resume that's relevant

980
00:40:39.845 --> 00:40:41.165
to being a business owner.

981
00:40:42.235 --> 00:40:45.135
Better make a buyer profile

982
00:40:45.135 --> 00:40:46.495
and I'll show you some headlining

983
00:40:46.975 --> 00:40:48.015
headlines in the next slide.

984
00:40:48.425 --> 00:40:49.935
We'll sending out the slides too.

985
00:40:49.995 --> 00:40:51.335
So you'll have all these headers.

986
00:40:51.795 --> 00:40:53.415
Um, but a buyer profile

987
00:40:53.485 --> 00:40:56.215
that demonstrates why you'd be a good buyer

988
00:40:56.675 --> 00:41:00.295
and a good owner best is if you have that buyer profile,

989
00:41:00.555 --> 00:41:02.695
you've put it in your LinkedIn headline

990
00:41:02.695 --> 00:41:04.695
that you're buying businesses and your bio.

991
00:41:04.875 --> 00:41:07.415
So there's consistency because guess what?

992
00:41:07.475 --> 00:41:08.855
You are gonna be Googled, right?

993
00:41:08.855 --> 00:41:09.935
And they're gonna be looking for it.

994
00:41:09.935 --> 00:41:11.135
If you're not putting it out there,

995
00:41:11.475 --> 00:41:13.575
are you genuinely serious about searching?

996
00:41:14.445 --> 00:41:18.495
Nice to have, but not at all necessary as a website.

997
00:41:18.685 --> 00:41:20.455
This is something that I think a lot

998
00:41:20.455 --> 00:41:22.295
of people think they need for credibility.

999
00:41:23.015 --> 00:41:25.175
I don't agree. If you have a buyer profile,

1000
00:41:25.315 --> 00:41:27.495
if people experience you as someone that's credible

1001
00:41:27.555 --> 00:41:29.815
and that can get this done, then the website,

1002
00:41:30.115 --> 00:41:31.255
you know, okay, whatever.

1003
00:41:31.355 --> 00:41:35.525
But like, make sure your website is you and different and,

1004
00:41:35.625 --> 00:41:37.125
and communicating your story

1005
00:41:37.125 --> 00:41:38.365
and your journey and your mission.

1006
00:41:38.985 --> 00:41:40.925
Um, but you don't need one.

1007
00:41:41.025 --> 00:41:44.525
And I I I, I had this with a lot of founders that I worked

1008
00:41:44.525 --> 00:41:45.725
with when they were starting businesses.

1009
00:41:45.725 --> 00:41:46.845
They're like, I need a logo and a website.

1010
00:41:46.905 --> 00:41:48.045
I'm like, no, you need

1011
00:41:48.045 --> 00:41:50.405
to see if people are gonna buy what you have to sell.

1012
00:41:50.895 --> 00:41:52.885
Y'all need to go out there and do that too.

1013
00:41:53.185 --> 00:41:54.325
Are people buying you?

1014
00:41:54.985 --> 00:41:57.285
Um, also you can put it in your email signature

1015
00:41:57.285 --> 00:41:58.325
like, Hey, I'm buying a business.

1016
00:41:58.325 --> 00:41:59.685
If you know anyone, please talk to me.

1017
00:41:59.755 --> 00:42:03.245
Like just these little things make such a big impact

1018
00:42:03.745 --> 00:42:05.245
and better for your audience.

1019
00:42:05.245 --> 00:42:06.245
Know your audience, right?

1020
00:42:07.905 --> 00:42:12.725
Business cards, brokers are boomers, sellers are boomers.

1021
00:42:12.795 --> 00:42:15.605
They like business cards. They like handshakes.

1022
00:42:15.605 --> 00:42:17.165
So you should get out there and network with them

1023
00:42:17.165 --> 00:42:18.605
and communicate with them in the way

1024
00:42:18.605 --> 00:42:20.765
that they like business cards.

1025
00:42:20.795 --> 00:42:22.805
They love it. I was going to these events trying

1026
00:42:22.805 --> 00:42:23.685
to meet business owners and

1027
00:42:23.685 --> 00:42:24.285
they're like, do you have a card?

1028
00:42:24.305 --> 00:42:27.285
I'm like, what? Why? So I get it.

1029
00:42:27.605 --> 00:42:30.205
Millennials and Gen Z, like, we don't do business.

1030
00:42:30.305 --> 00:42:31.965
So I, I've got the millennials

1031
00:42:31.965 --> 00:42:33.565
and the Gen Z taken care of on the back.

1032
00:42:33.565 --> 00:42:34.725
They can scan the QR code.

1033
00:42:34.725 --> 00:42:36.045
They don't have to take my card, but

1034
00:42:36.625 --> 00:42:38.645
before you do a website, I would do business cards.

1035
00:42:39.055 --> 00:42:42.995
Quite honestly. Okay, I'm not gonna go through each one

1036
00:42:42.995 --> 00:42:44.795
of these in details, but like I'll explain

1037
00:42:44.795 --> 00:42:45.915
the concept behind the two.

1038
00:42:45.985 --> 00:42:48.195
When you're putting a buyer profile together,

1039
00:42:48.855 --> 00:42:51.315
you wanna put together your acquisition criteria.

1040
00:42:52.225 --> 00:42:53.515
Importantly, like how are you

1041
00:42:53.515 --> 00:42:54.635
gonna finance this thing, right?

1042
00:42:54.775 --> 00:42:57.115
Get pre-qualified, I'm pre-qualified for this amount.

1043
00:42:57.185 --> 00:42:58.955
Cool, that covers it off right there.

1044
00:42:59.505 --> 00:43:01.795
Then what are your goals with business ownership?

1045
00:43:01.975 --> 00:43:04.435
The business characteristics that you want, what kind

1046
00:43:04.435 --> 00:43:06.315
of owner transition that you're looking for?

1047
00:43:06.455 --> 00:43:08.315
And what industries you're interested in.

1048
00:43:09.045 --> 00:43:12.475
Buyer profile is you, right? What's your career history?

1049
00:43:12.695 --> 00:43:15.395
The key attributes that are gonna make you a great owner

1050
00:43:15.815 --> 00:43:16.995
and your values and vision.

1051
00:43:17.175 --> 00:43:18.875
So you really wanna have both of those.

1052
00:43:19.055 --> 00:43:20.795
And we do that for all of our clients.

1053
00:43:20.855 --> 00:43:24.115
We put this together onto a profile

1054
00:43:24.115 --> 00:43:26.675
that we then send along every time we engage

1055
00:43:26.695 --> 00:43:27.755
on behalf of our client.

1056
00:43:28.455 --> 00:43:31.115
So really what you're trying to do is what is um,

1057
00:43:31.505 --> 00:43:33.555
what is the financial capability of this person?

1058
00:43:34.425 --> 00:43:36.835
What are they looking to buy and why?

1059
00:43:37.335 --> 00:43:39.675
And will they be a good owner of this business?

1060
00:43:39.815 --> 00:43:42.195
Do I believe that they will have an it takes to get it done

1061
00:43:43.315 --> 00:43:45.375
and communicate that in your buyer profile.

1062
00:43:46.755 --> 00:43:49.085
Just some quick tips 'cause I'm conscious of time.

1063
00:43:49.165 --> 00:43:50.365
I wanna leave time for questions.

1064
00:43:51.095 --> 00:43:53.805
Canva is literally the best $10 a month business

1065
00:43:53.805 --> 00:43:55.085
investment I have ever made.

1066
00:43:55.095 --> 00:43:57.325
Guess, guess where this presentation was made.

1067
00:43:57.325 --> 00:43:58.765
Guess where these business cards were made?

1068
00:43:59.165 --> 00:44:00.325
I am not a graphic designer,

1069
00:44:00.345 --> 00:44:03.165
but Canva makes stuff look so much better.

1070
00:44:03.785 --> 00:44:06.445
Um, so like you can make your buyer profile on that.

1071
00:44:06.445 --> 00:44:07.885
You can do business cards,

1072
00:44:08.225 --> 00:44:10.005
you can do just about everything there.

1073
00:44:10.185 --> 00:44:12.005
Um, it's an amazing investment.

1074
00:44:13.035 --> 00:44:17.285
Also, um, 10th grade language jargon is not your friend.

1075
00:44:17.545 --> 00:44:20.525
Um, so again, people feel like, oh, I need to demonstrate

1076
00:44:20.525 --> 00:44:22.565
that I have all this experience and credibility

1077
00:44:22.565 --> 00:44:23.645
and I know what I'm talking about.

1078
00:44:24.225 --> 00:44:26.725
If, especially if you come from like tech or corporate

1079
00:44:26.725 --> 00:44:28.605
and you're looking at getting into like blue collar

1080
00:44:28.965 --> 00:44:31.285
businesses, jargon is not your friend.

1081
00:44:31.585 --> 00:44:33.485
So if you need to run that stuff

1082
00:44:33.485 --> 00:44:35.685
through GPT on your Briar profile,

1083
00:44:36.145 --> 00:44:39.565
we intentionally take all those jargony words out,

1084
00:44:39.595 --> 00:44:41.965
like change management and blah blah blah.

1085
00:44:41.965 --> 00:44:44.085
Like all this jargon that comes up in corporate world

1086
00:44:44.505 --> 00:44:46.565
and like make it real like

1087
00:44:46.565 --> 00:44:48.405
so a 10th grader can understand it.

1088
00:44:48.785 --> 00:44:52.205
Um, and lastly, you know, will pointed this out.

1089
00:44:52.205 --> 00:44:55.005
You're gonna be Google. What are they gonna find right when

1090
00:44:55.005 --> 00:44:57.845
they go to your Facebook or when they go to your Instagram

1091
00:44:57.865 --> 00:44:59.325
or when they go to your LinkedIn,

1092
00:44:59.395 --> 00:45:01.165
what are they gonna find out about you?

1093
00:45:01.505 --> 00:45:03.205
And is there consistency with the brand

1094
00:45:03.205 --> 00:45:04.725
that you're putting out there as a buyer?

1095
00:45:05.695 --> 00:45:07.745
Okay, um, super quick.

1096
00:45:07.845 --> 00:45:09.185
Not a pitch on me, but some

1097
00:45:09.185 --> 00:45:10.465
of you're probably like, what do you do?

1098
00:45:11.045 --> 00:45:14.345
Um, we help first time buyers find and buy businesses.

1099
00:45:14.365 --> 00:45:17.025
You might wanna do this if you wanna keep your W2,

1100
00:45:17.045 --> 00:45:19.905
if you want that credibility, geographic constraints.

1101
00:45:20.325 --> 00:45:22.065
Uh, you don't wanna do this by yourself.

1102
00:45:22.515 --> 00:45:26.745
We've got an amazing team that go out and search for you

1103
00:45:26.765 --> 00:45:29.145
and help you get a deal over the line.

1104
00:45:29.405 --> 00:45:31.785
We spend a whole bunch of time understanding you

1105
00:45:32.085 --> 00:45:33.225
and creating your profile.

1106
00:45:33.725 --> 00:45:35.305
Um, we've been doing the numbers

1107
00:45:35.445 --> 00:45:37.145
and we actually save our clients 30

1108
00:45:37.145 --> 00:45:39.585
to 45 days a month, right?

1109
00:45:39.845 --> 00:45:41.105
You only have 30 days a month.

1110
00:45:41.205 --> 00:45:44.585
So we're actually increasing the amount of time

1111
00:45:44.585 --> 00:45:46.225
that is spent on your search.

1112
00:45:46.445 --> 00:45:48.625
So that was a cool stat that came up.

1113
00:45:48.965 --> 00:45:51.905
Um, and I heard this from Dylan, the founder of Baton,

1114
00:45:51.905 --> 00:45:54.985
which is a great, uh, new tech platform for brokering.

1115
00:45:55.285 --> 00:45:56.745
Um, and they did a study

1116
00:45:56.765 --> 00:45:58.745
and they said, you know, only 2% of people

1117
00:45:58.745 --> 00:46:01.385
that say they wanna buy a business actually do.

1118
00:46:02.545 --> 00:46:04.605
So there's a whole bunch of intention out there,

1119
00:46:04.665 --> 00:46:05.685
not a lot of follow through.

1120
00:46:05.985 --> 00:46:07.885
So we exist to help the 2%.

1121
00:46:08.645 --> 00:46:12.025
Um, reminder October 9th, uh,

1122
00:46:12.075 --> 00:46:14.025
we've got the part two of this webinar.

1123
00:46:14.205 --> 00:46:16.585
So if you enjoyed this and you wanna hear on how

1124
00:46:16.585 --> 00:46:18.025
to build relationships

1125
00:46:18.025 --> 00:46:20.145
that are gonna help you win over those sellers

1126
00:46:20.145 --> 00:46:22.505
and brokers through the way that you interact with them,

1127
00:46:22.845 --> 00:46:24.785

1129

And now I would love to answer any questions that came up.

1130
00:46:32.765 --> 00:46:35.505
Um, and that was so much fun. I'm so excited.

1131
00:46:35.645 --> 00:46:38.025
Uh, I got to share that. So thank you for your time.

1132
00:46:38.345 --> 00:46:39.345
I know it is limited.

1133
00:46:41.165 --> 00:46:43.705
Wow, Athena, that was epic.

1134
00:46:44.785 --> 00:46:48.475
That was, that was also a first that I received an email

1135
00:46:49.215 --> 00:46:51.875
during the webinar from somebody in the audience saying,

1136
00:46:51.935 --> 00:46:53.275
Hey, I'm in the webinar right now.

1137
00:46:53.275 --> 00:46:56.995
This is awesome. Really, really great energy.

1138
00:46:57.015 --> 00:46:58.915
Of course, Athena, um, oh,

1139
00:46:59.135 --> 00:47:00.135
That's a kind. Thank

1140
00:47:00.135 --> 00:47:01.275
you. Yeah.

1141
00:47:01.895 --> 00:47:04.315
And, um, and just totally practicing what you preach.

1142
00:47:04.375 --> 00:47:07.435
You, you eat your own dog food, you are pattern interrupt.

1143
00:47:07.775 --> 00:47:09.155
You care a lot about brand.

1144
00:47:09.575 --> 00:47:12.035
You, you do all, everything that you just taught us, uh,

1145
00:47:12.095 --> 00:47:13.275
you are the picture of.

1146
00:47:13.375 --> 00:47:14.595
So it's, it's very powerful.

1147
00:47:15.095 --> 00:47:19.195
Um, yeah, I, I mean I ha I was just, uh,

1148
00:47:19.265 --> 00:47:22.315
just the stuff about brand I, I just love.

1149
00:47:22.615 --> 00:47:26.595
Um, but just a couple things if I could that landed with me

1150
00:47:26.595 --> 00:47:28.275
that I thought were great points.

1151
00:47:29.945 --> 00:47:31.645
The attraction repulsion thing.

1152
00:47:31.865 --> 00:47:33.365
You know, attract people, repel people.

1153
00:47:33.875 --> 00:47:37.285
Your McGuire Woods experience where you attracted people

1154
00:47:37.285 --> 00:47:40.245
that were into your, your vibe and not those who weren't.

1155
00:47:40.275 --> 00:47:42.325
It's just, if you don't know anything about brand,

1156
00:47:42.325 --> 00:47:43.485
if you don't know anything about kind

1157
00:47:43.485 --> 00:47:45.005
of putting yourself out there into the public,

1158
00:47:45.965 --> 00:47:50.205
everyone's first reflex is to be liked by everyone.

1159
00:47:50.305 --> 00:47:52.205
You don't want to turn off anybody.

1160
00:47:52.385 --> 00:47:54.885
But you know, once you know something about branding,

1161
00:47:54.885 --> 00:47:57.685
you realize that, that if you're everything to everybody,

1162
00:47:57.685 --> 00:47:58.725
you're nothing to no one.

1163
00:47:58.825 --> 00:48:02.125
So you have to eventually stand for something.

1164
00:48:02.545 --> 00:48:05.205
Um, otherwise you will just be lost in the sea of,

1165
00:48:05.465 --> 00:48:07.445
of nondescript.

1166
00:48:08.145 --> 00:48:11.085
Um, so in some ways you just have to embrace the fact that,

1167
00:48:11.085 --> 00:48:12.805
that if you're gonna do this well, you're gonna

1168
00:48:13.495 --> 00:48:16.725
invariably maybe repel some people, um, which is

1169
00:48:16.835 --> 00:48:17.835
Okay. And you want that,

1170
00:48:17.835 --> 00:48:18.605
that's,

1171
00:48:18.605 --> 00:48:20.445
that's an indicator you're doing something right?

1172
00:48:20.705 --> 00:48:23.005
You know, you shouldn't be for everybody.

1173
00:48:23.065 --> 00:48:25.245
You're not gonna enjoy working with everyone.

1174
00:48:25.865 --> 00:48:29.325
Um, and, and yeah, like, I, I think it's okay,

1175
00:48:29.345 --> 00:48:31.805
but we, we obviously have trauma around being liked

1176
00:48:31.825 --> 00:48:33.925
and there's survival and that and that sort of thing,

1177
00:48:33.985 --> 00:48:36.925
but it's an indication that you're onto something good if,

1178
00:48:36.985 --> 00:48:38.925
if like, some people are like, I don't like that.

1179
00:48:39.685 --> 00:48:41.485
I don't think everybody's gonna like my flavor.

1180
00:48:41.595 --> 00:48:44.165
It's too much for some people. Like, that's good.

1181
00:48:44.305 --> 00:48:45.325
I'm, I'm cool with that.

1182
00:48:45.995 --> 00:48:47.605
Yeah. Right, right.

1183
00:48:48.145 --> 00:48:50.165
Um, and I just love how you,

1184
00:48:50.665 --> 00:48:52.165
the looking for signals of things.

1185
00:48:52.345 --> 00:48:54.765
So no one's gonna, it's like, what, what to be looking for?

1186
00:48:54.965 --> 00:48:56.525
'cause no one of course tells you, Hey,

1187
00:48:56.525 --> 00:48:57.805
you're doing this right and doing that, right?

1188
00:48:58.145 --> 00:48:59.965
You're looking for these indirect signals.

1189
00:49:00.025 --> 00:49:02.485
So encourage people to review all the signals

1190
00:49:02.485 --> 00:49:03.525
that you had at the bottom of the,

1191
00:49:03.525 --> 00:49:04.765
all the, those relevant slides.

1192
00:49:04.765 --> 00:49:06.725
That was awesome. Um, I could go on,

1193
00:49:06.725 --> 00:49:09.365
but I don't wanna steal from the audience's questions.

1194
00:49:10.025 --> 00:49:11.565
Um, so let's get into those.

1195
00:49:11.985 --> 00:49:15.695
Um, we knew we'd get this question.

1196
00:49:15.695 --> 00:49:18.015
You already touched on it. Should you have a website?

1197
00:49:18.155 --> 00:49:19.735
Expand on your thoughts there, please.

1198
00:49:20.845 --> 00:49:24.105
Yeah. So, um, like I said,

1199
00:49:24.285 --> 00:49:26.425
you are selling something, right?

1200
00:49:26.425 --> 00:49:30.705
You're selling yourself in this and building a website

1201
00:49:30.725 --> 00:49:32.545
before you know what your pitch is

1202
00:49:32.765 --> 00:49:34.545
and how you get people to convert.

1203
00:49:35.165 --> 00:49:37.425
Um, oh, did I know you're there? Okay, good.

1204
00:49:37.685 --> 00:49:42.595
Um, you're, I see it as a false product.

1205
00:49:42.745 --> 00:49:45.395
Like you feel productive by building a website,

1206
00:49:45.395 --> 00:49:46.955
but it's not actually doing the thing

1207
00:49:46.955 --> 00:49:48.875
that will get you the outcome that you want,

1208
00:49:48.875 --> 00:49:50.075
which is to be a business owner.

1209
00:49:50.535 --> 00:49:51.875
If you want the outcome,

1210
00:49:52.185 --> 00:49:53.755
then you should be putting yourself out there,

1211
00:49:53.775 --> 00:49:56.115
having more conversations, seeing if you can get

1212
00:49:56.115 --> 00:49:57.515
through the brokerage to the owner.

1213
00:49:57.825 --> 00:49:58.915
This is the first thing

1214
00:49:58.915 --> 00:50:00.955
that we have clients do when they work with us.

1215
00:50:01.025 --> 00:50:03.835
It's like, regardless of whether you like, okay,

1216
00:50:03.855 --> 00:50:05.475
you might not love the deal,

1217
00:50:05.855 --> 00:50:08.075
but I need you to also practice how

1218
00:50:08.075 --> 00:50:09.115
to get through the gatekeeper.

1219
00:50:10.815 --> 00:50:12.315
So if you're building a website

1220
00:50:12.315 --> 00:50:13.635
before you've had those conversations,

1221
00:50:13.635 --> 00:50:18.195
and you know what unlocks access to the ultimate prize.

1222
00:50:18.715 --> 00:50:21.275
Building a website is just, it makes you feel productive,

1223
00:50:21.275 --> 00:50:22.635
but it's not actually doing something.

1224
00:50:23.025 --> 00:50:24.715
Also, you probably, when you build it,

1225
00:50:24.715 --> 00:50:27.300
aren't gonna have the SEO capabilities to make sure

1226
00:50:27.300 --> 00:50:30.005
that when they google your name, it's you that's coming up.

1227
00:50:30.545 --> 00:50:32.645
If you genuinely feel like it would help you,

1228
00:50:32.825 --> 00:50:34.245
or you can do it very quickly

1229
00:50:34.345 --> 00:50:36.405
and it won't distract from the overall outcome.

1230
00:50:36.955 --> 00:50:41.045
Sure. But make sure you're making it authentic to you.

1231
00:50:41.345 --> 00:50:45.245
You're telling your story, you're speaking to your hero as

1232
00:50:45.245 --> 00:50:47.165
to like what you're gonna do for them, right?

1233
00:50:47.265 --> 00:50:50.005
All of these concepts should be portrayed in,

1234
00:50:50.225 --> 00:50:53.125
in the website, but I honestly don't think you need it.

1235
00:50:53.765 --> 00:50:56.565
I really don't. You create a really great PDF buyer profile

1236
00:50:56.565 --> 00:50:58.925
that you can send along, that's more than enough.

1237
00:50:58.985 --> 00:51:03.285
And remember your audience that, like most of 'em don't, uh,

1238
00:51:03.345 --> 00:51:04.725
you know, even getting 'em on Zoom,

1239
00:51:04.725 --> 00:51:05.885
sometimes they don't do it.

1240
00:51:05.885 --> 00:51:07.685
They, they jump on the phone or whatever.

1241
00:51:07.865 --> 00:51:09.205
So you wanna make sure

1242
00:51:09.315 --> 00:51:11.405
that you're communicating to your audience.

1243
00:51:12.145 --> 00:51:13.445
Um, yeah,

1244
00:51:13.645 --> 00:51:16.365
I think a good PDF buyer profile is more than enough.

1245
00:51:18.405 --> 00:51:21.315
Great. Thanks, Athena. You still you still got me?

1246
00:51:21.315 --> 00:51:23.875
Sorry, my, um, I do, yeah, I'm still here. Okay, great.

1247
00:51:24.335 --> 00:51:27.765
Um, okay.

1248
00:51:28.345 --> 00:51:31.365
Uh, about, uh, acqui match,

1249
00:51:31.385 --> 00:51:33.005
do you only help first time buyers?

1250
00:51:34.545 --> 00:51:35.605
Yes, as of right now,

1251
00:51:35.605 --> 00:51:37.605
because that we have a methodology for

1252
00:51:37.605 --> 00:51:39.045
how we take people through things.

1253
00:51:39.225 --> 00:51:42.885
So if you are like an experience, uh,

1254
00:51:43.125 --> 00:51:44.205
actually I, there's a caveat.

1255
00:51:44.885 --> 00:51:47.165
I have a client who bought a business seven years ago,

1256
00:51:47.585 --> 00:51:49.485
and the playing field was very different

1257
00:51:49.995 --> 00:51:51.365
back then than what it is now.

1258
00:51:51.365 --> 00:51:52.645
And they're like, I have no idea.

1259
00:51:52.875 --> 00:51:55.165
Like, it's a totally different like,

1260
00:51:55.235 --> 00:51:56.965
landscape, so I need help.

1261
00:51:57.385 --> 00:52:00.645
So in those situations where people are okay, uh, going

1262
00:52:00.645 --> 00:52:02.645
through our methodology of getting you

1263
00:52:02.805 --> 00:52:04.445
to become the right buyer, then that's good.

1264
00:52:04.505 --> 00:52:06.085
But if you're like, I'm experienced,

1265
00:52:06.325 --> 00:52:08.925
I just wanna buy this type of business, we'll refer you out

1266
00:52:08.925 --> 00:52:10.725
to great partners that can help you do that.

1267
00:52:13.135 --> 00:52:14.875
Uh, how do you suggest

1268
00:52:14.875 --> 00:52:16.755
to build a visible buyer profile

1269
00:52:16.895 --> 00:52:18.035
if you still have a day job.

1270
00:52:18.035 --> 00:52:20.115
There's a, a couple of variations on this question,

1271
00:52:20.175 --> 00:52:22.955
but the point is that they don't want their, I guess,

1272
00:52:22.955 --> 00:52:24.355
that they don't want their current employer

1273
00:52:24.355 --> 00:52:27.075
or their boss to know that they're out there looking

1274
00:52:27.095 --> 00:52:28.555
for a business to buy to then quit.

1275
00:52:29.145 --> 00:52:33.315
Yeah. Okay. So, um, we actually, a lot

1276
00:52:33.315 --> 00:52:35.835
of our clients come to us for that reason, right?

1277
00:52:35.835 --> 00:52:38.315
So we're able to anonymize people and,

1278
00:52:38.315 --> 00:52:40.115
and add that credibility without

1279
00:52:40.115 --> 00:52:41.555
completely putting them out there.

1280
00:52:42.135 --> 00:52:45.075
Um, I'm gonna pull up one of our buyer profiles real quick

1281
00:52:45.175 --> 00:52:47.275
to show how I did this, if that's okay.

1282
00:52:47.975 --> 00:52:50.555
Mm-hmm. Um, this is just, uh, actually,

1283
00:52:50.575 --> 00:52:52.195
let me make sure I've got it in the,

1284
00:52:52.275 --> 00:52:53.435
I still got my slides up.

1285
00:52:54.415 --> 00:52:55.905
This is a, like John Doe

1286
00:52:55.905 --> 00:52:56.905
and it's not, um,

1287
00:52:59.525 --> 00:53:00.975
it's not an actual person,

1288
00:53:01.635 --> 00:53:05.715
but, um, you can create a profile

1289
00:53:05.715 --> 00:53:08.675
that you send along to people, um, you know,

1290
00:53:08.675 --> 00:53:09.755
when you're engaging with them,

1291
00:53:09.815 --> 00:53:11.195
but you're gonna have to be you

1292
00:53:12.065 --> 00:53:13.635
when you go to these brokers.

1293
00:53:13.635 --> 00:53:15.755
So if you're like, I need to stay undercover,

1294
00:53:15.755 --> 00:53:17.795
then building a website's kind of per that,

1295
00:53:17.795 --> 00:53:19.355
that's why I like the buyer profile,

1296
00:53:19.755 --> 00:53:21.035
PDF that you send along.

1297
00:53:21.275 --> 00:53:22.435
'cause you're gonna have to gauge with them.

1298
00:53:22.975 --> 00:53:25.645
Um, but when we do this for clients, we don't put last name.

1299
00:53:25.665 --> 00:53:27.925
We don't put identifying information about them.

1300
00:53:28.505 --> 00:53:32.445
So we'll talk about, um, you know, their experience,

1301
00:53:32.585 --> 00:53:34.525
the kinds of businesses that they worked at,

1302
00:53:35.025 --> 00:53:37.245
but we won't say specifically the company name.

1303
00:53:37.245 --> 00:53:38.485
We won't say their last name.

1304
00:53:39.025 --> 00:53:41.965
Um, and then when we reach out, you know, we're,

1305
00:53:41.965 --> 00:53:43.125
we're talking about this person,

1306
00:53:43.125 --> 00:53:45.125
eventually you're gonna have to come out to this person.

1307
00:53:45.825 --> 00:53:48.805
Um, but this is all basically anonymized

1308
00:53:48.825 --> 00:53:50.645
and it gives a ton of the information

1309
00:53:50.645 --> 00:53:52.645
that you're gonna need, the acquisition criteria,

1310
00:53:52.915 --> 00:53:56.045
this person's personal goals, business characteristics

1311
00:53:56.045 --> 00:53:57.965
that they're looking for, owner transition.

1312
00:53:58.385 --> 00:54:00.365
And then on the right is the profile, right?

1313
00:54:00.435 --> 00:54:03.925
Like, tell me about you, your story, your career history,

1314
00:54:04.075 --> 00:54:07.205
what your key attributes are, your values and vision.

1315
00:54:07.675 --> 00:54:09.445
None of this says who this person is.

1316
00:54:09.945 --> 00:54:12.765
Um, but you can still tell a story without doing that.

1317
00:54:13.265 --> 00:54:15.605
Um, industries of interest

1318
00:54:15.605 --> 00:54:16.765
and then the fact that they've been

1319
00:54:16.765 --> 00:54:18.245
pre-qualified, et cetera.

1320
00:54:18.245 --> 00:54:19.485
Those are the main key things.

1321
00:54:20.145 --> 00:54:21.805
But, um, I would say

1322
00:54:26.795 --> 00:54:28.975
at some point you're gonna have to tell people, right?

1323
00:54:29.075 --> 00:54:31.615
So then I, then I would have a deeper con conversation

1324
00:54:31.615 --> 00:54:33.655
with yourself of like, are you really gonna do this?

1325
00:54:34.395 --> 00:54:36.015
You know, if you're scared to put it out there

1326
00:54:36.015 --> 00:54:38.135
that this is something that you want to do, um,

1327
00:54:38.675 --> 00:54:40.135
you're gonna have to, when you go

1328
00:54:40.135 --> 00:54:41.615
through the diligence process, right?

1329
00:54:41.925 --> 00:54:43.095
Like, it's, it's gonna be tough.

1330
00:54:43.195 --> 00:54:44.455
So you can keep it secret,

1331
00:54:44.955 --> 00:54:46.215
but it's gonna be really difficult

1332
00:54:46.215 --> 00:54:47.575
to do if you're doing it on your own.

1333
00:54:48.275 --> 00:54:51.135
Um, and I don't think you need a public persona necessarily.

1334
00:54:51.555 --> 00:54:55.375
Uh, if you're engaging a lot directly with like brokers and,

1335
00:54:55.475 --> 00:54:56.895
and, and, you know, engaging

1336
00:54:56.895 --> 00:54:58.295
with listings and stuff like that,

1337
00:55:00.425 --> 00:55:01.425
Great.

1338
00:55:01.995 --> 00:55:03.855
Um, Damien wants to know

1339
00:55:03.855 --> 00:55:06.215
how Athena overlaid herself over the slides.

1340
00:55:09.385 --> 00:55:11.095
Isn't it such a cool feature. Okay.

1341
00:55:11.145 --> 00:55:13.575
Other fun feature on LinkedIn

1342
00:55:13.595 --> 00:55:16.655
or on a Zoom that people don't realize is you can put a

1343
00:55:16.655 --> 00:55:18.135
video up, uh,

1344
00:55:18.135 --> 00:55:20.375
when people are sitting in your waiting room on Zoom.

1345
00:55:20.675 --> 00:55:21.855
So my poor team,

1346
00:55:22.045 --> 00:55:23.775
like they all have this in their waiting room,

1347
00:55:23.795 --> 00:55:26.255
and it's me being like, hi, welcome to a iMatch.

1348
00:55:26.255 --> 00:55:29.255
Here's what we do. Um, but like branding, right?

1349
00:55:29.635 --> 00:55:32.775
Uh, when you hit share, there's some options

1350
00:55:32.875 --> 00:55:34.615
and it will show you on the right hand side

1351
00:55:34.615 --> 00:55:37.895
that you can like, do a person overlay over the slides.

1352
00:55:38.755 --> 00:55:40.735
Um, but that was a, it's a,

1353
00:55:40.735 --> 00:55:42.215
it's a branding thing for me, right?

1354
00:55:42.375 --> 00:55:44.255
I know I'm very animated as a person

1355
00:55:44.475 --> 00:55:47.495
and that helps me when I, I do these presentations.

1356
00:55:47.595 --> 00:55:49.015
So it's an intentional choice

1357
00:55:49.075 --> 00:55:51.135
to overlay myself over those slides too.

1358
00:55:52.755 --> 00:55:54.145
Great. Uh, my wife

1359
00:55:54.145 --> 00:55:55.905
and I have already purchased one business

1360
00:55:55.905 --> 00:55:57.465
that we're currently operating

1361
00:55:57.565 --> 00:56:00.305
and are actively engaging with several others to add

1362
00:56:00.305 --> 00:56:02.185
to our family long-term HoldCo.

1363
00:56:02.185 --> 00:56:04.585
Love it. I wanna build a website promoting

1364
00:56:04.585 --> 00:56:05.705
that we are actively looking

1365
00:56:05.725 --> 00:56:07.225
for business to businesses to buy.

1366
00:56:07.225 --> 00:56:08.345
So they do wanna do a website,

1367
00:56:08.605 --> 00:56:11.625
but wanna display the businesses that we do not want

1368
00:56:11.765 --> 00:56:13.265
and give I ideas of the businesses

1369
00:56:13.265 --> 00:56:14.985
that we do would like to look at.

1370
00:56:15.605 --> 00:56:18.425
Um, I think says the, the questioner,

1371
00:56:18.545 --> 00:56:20.545
I think this transparency will be refreshing.

1372
00:56:21.495 --> 00:56:25.205
Does this come from a negative place in terms of branding

1373
00:56:25.265 --> 00:56:27.965
to say, I don't want, I get this is Will now talking

1374
00:56:28.185 --> 00:56:29.645
to say, I don't want x.

1375
00:56:30.265 --> 00:56:32.795
Is that putting negativity out there

1376
00:56:32.795 --> 00:56:34.435
and does that, does that tarnish the brand?

1377
00:56:34.435 --> 00:56:35.795
Should everything just be positive,

1378
00:56:35.795 --> 00:56:37.275
you know, sort of affirmative? No, I,

1379
00:56:37.315 --> 00:56:40.155
I think it's like, okay, so when I, I have this like,

1380
00:56:40.175 --> 00:56:42.915
fun presentation where I actually teach branding

1381
00:56:42.935 --> 00:56:44.195
as a concept and stuff.

1382
00:56:44.255 --> 00:56:48.275
And the strongest brands in the world know who they aren't.

1383
00:56:48.825 --> 00:56:51.835
They know who they're not for, they say no to things, right?

1384
00:56:51.895 --> 00:56:53.875
But it's, it's all in how you position it.

1385
00:56:54.295 --> 00:56:57.075
Um, I, I'm pretty sure even on our website on the buyer

1386
00:56:57.075 --> 00:56:59.035
page, it's like, who we're not for, right?

1387
00:56:59.655 --> 00:57:01.355
Um, so it's okay to do that

1388
00:57:01.375 --> 00:57:03.875
and it helps people like to self-identify

1389
00:57:03.975 --> 00:57:06.155
and like, it's, it's part of that magnetism thing.

1390
00:57:06.185 --> 00:57:08.075
It's like, here's what's important to us.

1391
00:57:08.095 --> 00:57:11.155
Here's what is a good fit, here's what's not a good fit.

1392
00:57:11.615 --> 00:57:14.595
Um, so just like saying rather than like, we don't want it

1393
00:57:14.595 --> 00:57:18.075
or whatever you can, you can make the language is so like,

1394
00:57:18.215 --> 00:57:20.755
Hey, uh, so we're not open to everything

1395
00:57:20.755 --> 00:57:22.875
or everything's not gonna be a great fit for us.

1396
00:57:23.215 --> 00:57:24.675
Here's what's not a good fit.

1397
00:57:24.895 --> 00:57:27.475
And, and absolutely, and I think you should do that

1398
00:57:27.655 --> 00:57:29.195
and say what you're not interested in.

1399
00:57:29.915 --> 00:57:32.515
Actually, interestingly, when we go through, um,

1400
00:57:32.775 --> 00:57:34.555
our process, we have clients go

1401
00:57:34.555 --> 00:57:36.875
through this really exhaustive like, um,

1402
00:57:37.395 --> 00:57:38.915
business characteristics questionnaire

1403
00:57:39.055 --> 00:57:40.875
and spend a lot of time on industries.

1404
00:57:41.255 --> 00:57:42.995
And we don't have them choose what they want.

1405
00:57:43.095 --> 00:57:45.275
We have them choose what they don't want. Hmm.

1406
00:57:45.275 --> 00:57:48.435
Because like when people are industry agnostic, it's like,

1407
00:57:48.475 --> 00:57:49.715
I need to know what your nos are.

1408
00:57:49.995 --> 00:57:52.275
'cause I don't want that the big old

1409
00:57:52.275 --> 00:57:53.355
team that I put the slide up.

1410
00:57:53.355 --> 00:57:54.995
I don't want them spending time on deals

1411
00:57:55.105 --> 00:57:56.675
that if I put it right in front of you,

1412
00:57:56.675 --> 00:57:58.315
you're gonna be like, oh no, I'd never do that, right?

1413
00:57:58.315 --> 00:58:01.155
Mm-hmm. So like mm-hmm. The hard nos are more important

1414
00:58:02.175 --> 00:58:04.035
really than the maybes

1415
00:58:04.035 --> 00:58:05.875
because it's like, well, maybe I'd be open to that.

1416
00:58:05.905 --> 00:58:07.355
Okay, cool, we can work with that.

1417
00:58:07.735 --> 00:58:12.235
But I had a client, um, who like their family had a, a

1418
00:58:12.875 --> 00:58:14.715
septic business and he is like, Nope,

1419
00:58:14.725 --> 00:58:16.035
never again, nothing in waste.

1420
00:58:16.245 --> 00:58:18.995
Don't ever put anything in front of me that has waste.

1421
00:58:19.055 --> 00:58:20.995
And I was like, cool, that's great. You know?

1422
00:58:21.095 --> 00:58:24.235
So, um, I think you can actually be a lot more effective

1423
00:58:24.235 --> 00:58:26.435
knowing what your no are than what your maybes are.

1424
00:58:27.455 --> 00:58:32.245
Great. Uh, can you say something about, uh,

1425
00:58:32.245 --> 00:58:35.045
your fees and how you guys get paid, what your cost

1426
00:58:36.065 --> 00:58:37.205
and where you're based?

1427
00:58:38.115 --> 00:58:40.925
Yeah. So we help clients all over the us.

1428
00:58:41.065 --> 00:58:42.365
We only work with US clients

1429
00:58:42.365 --> 00:58:44.085
because we spend a lot of time helping you

1430
00:58:44.085 --> 00:58:45.725
with the structuring, um,

1431
00:58:45.865 --> 00:58:48.205
and the financing, uh, side of things also.

1432
00:58:48.665 --> 00:58:51.885
Um, so we do a, uh,

1433
00:58:52.195 --> 00:58:54.445
flat fee depending on your search,

1434
00:58:55.145 --> 00:58:57.285
and you'll pay the majority of that upfront.

1435
00:58:57.345 --> 00:58:58.485
That's your skin in the game.

1436
00:58:58.485 --> 00:59:00.245
It gives you credibility with the lenders.

1437
00:59:00.665 --> 00:59:03.085
Um, and then there's a small fee that, uh,

1438
00:59:03.425 --> 00:59:05.085
we will get when you close.

1439
00:59:05.785 --> 00:59:08.125
Um, we had to structure it differently

1440
00:59:08.145 --> 00:59:09.685
to make sure we're SBA compliant.

1441
00:59:09.685 --> 00:59:12.765
So fun fact about our fees is you can apply all of them

1442
00:59:12.785 --> 00:59:15.165
to the equity injection when you close on the business,

1443
00:59:15.885 --> 00:59:18.605
provided you work with a lender that understands, uh, us

1444
00:59:18.705 --> 00:59:20.245
and, and how we add value.

1445
00:59:20.825 --> 00:59:22.045
Um, but you're essentially

1446
00:59:22.045 --> 00:59:23.405
prepaying your down payment with us.

1447
00:59:23.865 --> 00:59:26.885
Um, and everyone depending on the, the search

1448
00:59:26.885 --> 00:59:28.445
that we're doing with you gets the same fee.

1449
00:59:28.465 --> 00:59:30.205
So we don't do percentage based fees

1450
00:59:30.205 --> 00:59:33.445
because I think that then incentivizes me badly

1451
00:59:33.585 --> 00:59:35.245
and incentivizes my team badly.

1452
00:59:35.865 --> 00:59:38.885
Um, so everyone will get the same focus rather than like,

1453
00:59:38.885 --> 00:59:40.925
oh, this person's going after a bigger deal,

1454
00:59:40.945 --> 00:59:42.245
and I'll get a percentage of that.

1455
00:59:42.735 --> 00:59:44.885
Those aren't SBA compliant either.

1456
00:59:45.065 --> 00:59:47.845
So, um, long story short, the the way

1457
00:59:47.845 --> 00:59:49.805
that you can decide whether you wanna have a chat

1458
00:59:49.805 --> 00:59:52.685
with us is we'd like to see people have at least 200,000,

1459
00:59:53.185 --> 00:59:55.085
um, available to invest in a business.

1460
00:59:55.785 --> 00:59:57.125
Um, and then

1461
00:59:57.395 --> 00:59:59.405
that won't break the debt service coverage

1462
00:59:59.415 --> 01:00:00.605
ratio with our fee.

1463
01:00:01.305 --> 01:00:05.685
Um, and Austin on our team can have a conversation with you

1464
01:00:05.705 --> 01:00:07.685
and kind of find out more about your search.

1465
01:00:08.265 --> 01:00:13.125
Um, we're a white glove concierge service, so it's a, uh,

1466
01:00:13.245 --> 01:00:14.685
a service that we're providing to you.

1467
01:00:14.685 --> 01:00:16.285
So we need to find a little bit more about

1468
01:00:16.485 --> 01:00:18.485
what you're trying to do before I can give you that price.

1469
01:00:18.665 --> 01:00:21.365
But if you've got at least 200 available to invest,

1470
01:00:21.395 --> 01:00:24.765
then the fees will be fine with you looking at businesses.

1471
01:00:25.965 --> 01:00:29.075
Great. And if I'll just underline something you said

1472
01:00:29.075 --> 01:00:32.195
there, Athena, about your fee being flat.

1473
01:00:32.615 --> 01:00:34.075
It doesn't vary from deal size

1474
01:00:34.075 --> 01:00:35.555
to deal size or person to person.

1475
01:00:36.105 --> 01:00:38.555
That is a little bit uncommon in, in m

1476
01:00:38.555 --> 01:00:41.635
and a land where maybe other buy sided brokers have a model

1477
01:00:41.635 --> 01:00:44.555
where they, it's like, could be like a layman structure

1478
01:00:44.555 --> 01:00:45.915
or something where they, um,

1479
01:00:46.375 --> 01:00:48.155
are earning a percentage based on deal size,

1480
01:00:48.155 --> 01:00:50.315
and so there's gonna be some incentive for them

1481
01:00:50.375 --> 01:00:52.315
to bring you a bigger deal and

1482
01:00:52.335 --> 01:00:55.595
or work for the clients that are shopping the biggest deals.

1483
01:00:55.595 --> 01:00:57.835
Yeah. Um, so you don't, that that was just to,

1484
01:00:57.835 --> 01:00:59.275
you already said it, but just to say it again

1485
01:00:59.295 --> 01:01:00.515
so people really understand it.

1486
01:01:00.775 --> 01:01:02.675
You don't have that, those cross incentives,

1487
01:01:02.855 --> 01:01:04.235
you treat every client the same

1488
01:01:05.135 --> 01:01:06.955
And most of the percentage,

1489
01:01:06.955 --> 01:01:09.315
but like, if you work with a percentage based firm, you,

1490
01:01:09.315 --> 01:01:10.515
you're probably not gonna be able

1491
01:01:10.515 --> 01:01:12.515
to use SBA money to pay that.

1492
01:01:12.515 --> 01:01:14.515
You're gonna have to pay it in addition to

1493
01:01:15.505 --> 01:01:16.795
what you're doing, uh,

1494
01:01:16.975 --> 01:01:18.715
equity injection wise through your deal.

1495
01:01:19.015 --> 01:01:22.075
So, um, we protect your buying power,

1496
01:01:22.075 --> 01:01:23.675
essentially, which is pretty cool.

1497
01:01:24.535 --> 01:01:26.105
Yeah, that's very powerful.

1498
01:01:26.525 --> 01:01:30.065
Um, yeah, everybody, so people asking about the fees, so,

1499
01:01:30.065 --> 01:01:32.305
you know, you heard Athena get in touch.

1500
01:01:32.805 --> 01:01:36.065
Um, okay, uh, let's see, couple more here.

1501
01:01:37.445 --> 01:01:39.705
How would you advise a young woman without a finance

1502
01:01:39.765 --> 01:01:41.945
or MBA background to position herself

1503
01:01:42.005 --> 01:01:44.505
as a serious buyer in a search fund process?

1504
01:01:44.695 --> 01:01:47.625
What strengths or experiences tend to differentiate women

1505
01:01:48.005 --> 01:01:49.745
or non-traditional backgrounds,

1506
01:01:49.985 --> 01:01:52.985
I guess non-finance backgrounds when competing

1507
01:01:52.985 --> 01:01:55.385
with the typical male MBA crowd?

1508
01:01:55.635 --> 01:01:56.635
Great question.

1509
01:01:57.535 --> 01:01:58.775
I love this question so much.

1510
01:01:59.055 --> 01:02:01.375
'cause here's, here's a pattern, interrupt, answer, right?

1511
01:02:02.195 --> 01:02:04.815
Um, women, we have such an advantage,

1512
01:02:05.325 --> 01:02:07.495
such an advantage in this space

1513
01:02:07.495 --> 01:02:09.815
because we're already a pattern interrupt.

1514
01:02:10.275 --> 01:02:12.975
And I can tell you wholeheartedly that all

1515
01:02:12.975 --> 01:02:14.935
of these wonderful men that are in the ETA

1516
01:02:15.195 --> 01:02:17.935
and finance community want to support women.

1517
01:02:18.595 --> 01:02:19.965
So in, in effect,

1518
01:02:20.145 --> 01:02:22.685
you are already a pattern interrupted at an

1519
01:02:22.685 --> 01:02:23.845
advantage being a woman.

1520
01:02:24.385 --> 01:02:27.685
Um, and I'm gonna get into some general, like, so a lot of

1521
01:02:27.685 --> 01:02:29.485
what I am interested in is psychology,

1522
01:02:29.625 --> 01:02:32.005
how we're wired survival, et cetera.

1523
01:02:32.425 --> 01:02:36.885
Um, there's some really great, uh, work by Barbara Houston.

1524
01:02:37.665 --> 01:02:39.805
Um, she wrote a book called Rewire for Wealth,

1525
01:02:39.945 --> 01:02:42.925
but essentially like women are, are wired

1526
01:02:43.105 --> 01:02:45.005
to protect our resources, right?

1527
01:02:45.075 --> 01:02:47.125
Like we gotta protect our family.

1528
01:02:47.665 --> 01:02:50.325
And, and back in the days when men had to go out

1529
01:02:50.325 --> 01:02:52.245
and hunt, we had to make sure we were protecting the camp.

1530
01:02:52.625 --> 01:02:55.805
So men are actually wired to take risk

1531
01:02:55.885 --> 01:02:57.725
because that's how they survived, that's

1532
01:02:57.725 --> 01:03:01.285
how they passed on their DNA women are wired to protect.

1533
01:03:01.625 --> 01:03:03.605
So investment, finance, that sort

1534
01:03:03.605 --> 01:03:05.085
of thing is a natural like that.

1535
01:03:05.085 --> 01:03:06.805
That's why I think we don't see a lot

1536
01:03:06.805 --> 01:03:09.445
of women in the finance space, um, is

1537
01:03:09.445 --> 01:03:10.925
because it's, it's just not a natural thing.

1538
01:03:10.925 --> 01:03:13.285
It's very unnatural for us to be like,

1539
01:03:13.305 --> 01:03:15.165
let me put everything on the line, you know?

1540
01:03:15.985 --> 01:03:20.525
Um, but that being said, men are very competitive.

1541
01:03:20.525 --> 01:03:22.805
They're, they're wired to be competitive,

1542
01:03:22.805 --> 01:03:25.125
whether they actually are in effect or not,

1543
01:03:25.585 --> 01:03:28.365
but their wiring is to be competitive with other men

1544
01:03:28.745 --> 01:03:31.995
and to protect and help women, right?

1545
01:03:32.375 --> 01:03:33.435
So when we know this,

1546
01:03:33.535 --> 01:03:35.995
and it's not like, oh, I'm being looked down upon

1547
01:03:35.995 --> 01:03:37.955
because I'm a woman, actually, it's an advantage

1548
01:03:37.955 --> 01:03:39.675
because I'm not seen as a threat

1549
01:03:40.295 --> 01:03:41.955
to men by like walking around.

1550
01:03:41.955 --> 01:03:44.915
They're like, Hey, cool, what are you doing? How can I help?

1551
01:03:45.135 --> 01:03:47.275
You know? And honestly, this is, this is what I get.

1552
01:03:47.295 --> 01:03:49.555
And when I showed up in leopard print

1553
01:03:49.655 --> 01:03:52.235
and rhinestone cowboy boots, you know,

1554
01:03:52.775 --> 01:03:55.755
men were super great at interacting with me.

1555
01:03:56.215 --> 01:03:59.555
It was women that were giving me the cold show shoulder

1556
01:03:59.815 --> 01:04:00.955
and not treating me well.

1557
01:04:01.055 --> 01:04:03.675
And I, I think we've been conditioned to think

1558
01:04:03.675 --> 01:04:05.475
that we are in competition with each other

1559
01:04:05.535 --> 01:04:06.555
for limited spots.

1560
01:04:07.055 --> 01:04:08.875
And the more that we can actually support each other

1561
01:04:08.975 --> 01:04:11.595
and cheer each other on, um, the better.

1562
01:04:11.895 --> 01:04:14.315
Um, Becky is doing a great job

1563
01:04:14.315 --> 01:04:15.755
of like bringing women into this space.

1564
01:04:15.855 --> 01:04:18.955
The SM Bash guys are like always trying to get more women

1565
01:04:19.015 --> 01:04:20.355
to the events, that sort of thing.

1566
01:04:20.355 --> 01:04:23.715
So there's no, uh, limit on people wanting to support

1567
01:04:23.715 --> 01:04:25.715
and back women actually, uh,

1568
01:04:25.735 --> 01:04:28.035
at the independent sponsor conference, for example,

1569
01:04:28.955 --> 01:04:32.235
I got a bunch of, like, I tried to request meetings

1570
01:04:32.235 --> 01:04:34.875
with a bunch of investors who wrote to me after the fact,

1571
01:04:34.875 --> 01:04:36.515
and they're like, I love backing women.

1572
01:04:36.745 --> 01:04:40.395
Like, women don't take the kind of risks that men do,

1573
01:04:40.395 --> 01:04:42.715
so they end up being very solid investments.

1574
01:04:43.575 --> 01:04:47.635
So I say all that to say, reframe in your mind that actually

1575
01:04:47.715 --> 01:04:49.515
what you're perceiving is your weakness is

1576
01:04:49.515 --> 01:04:51.155
your absolute superpower.

1577
01:04:51.535 --> 01:04:53.315
You're already a pattern interrupt,

1578
01:04:53.495 --> 01:04:56.235
and your rarity is something that people wanna support.

1579
01:04:56.235 --> 01:04:58.755
People want more women as business owners.

1580
01:04:58.785 --> 01:05:01.075
They want more women to invest in.

1581
01:05:01.075 --> 01:05:02.875
They want more women to be doing this.

1582
01:05:03.095 --> 01:05:04.955
So using that to your advantage.

1583
01:05:05.475 --> 01:05:07.195
I don't have a finance background

1584
01:05:07.195 --> 01:05:10.155
or an MBA either, you know, like, um,

1585
01:05:10.255 --> 01:05:11.995
and imposter syndrome is real.

1586
01:05:12.025 --> 01:05:14.435
Like I was teaching entrepreneurship at one of the top

1587
01:05:14.955 --> 01:05:16.755
business schools in the country because I,

1588
01:05:17.125 --> 01:05:19.565
I have battle wounds of entrepreneurship, right?

1589
01:05:19.565 --> 01:05:21.165
Like I have, I have the experience.

1590
01:05:21.545 --> 01:05:23.765
So what you need to dig into is what's your story?

1591
01:05:24.345 --> 01:05:25.445
What's your qualities?

1592
01:05:25.465 --> 01:05:27.165
What's gonna make you a good business owner?

1593
01:05:27.195 --> 01:05:28.325
What have you experienced

1594
01:05:28.425 --> 01:05:31.245
or done in your life that you could communicate to people?

1595
01:05:31.745 --> 01:05:34.365
And, and that's what's going to attract them to you.

1596
01:05:34.865 --> 01:05:38.925
If you feel like you don't have, um, you know, experience

1597
01:05:38.945 --> 01:05:41.445
yet, then go out and, and collect that experience.

1598
01:05:41.745 --> 01:05:45.125
Go shadow people in their businesses, go volunteer.

1599
01:05:45.385 --> 01:05:47.885
Go find opportunities to give yourself

1600
01:05:47.885 --> 01:05:49.405
that experience and those stories.

1601
01:05:49.785 --> 01:05:53.325
So people are like, okay, I, I see what you have to give.

1602
01:05:53.665 --> 01:05:56.765
So if you've done marketing your whole life, like use that

1603
01:05:56.765 --> 01:05:58.245
to your advantage and be real about that.

1604
01:05:58.245 --> 01:06:02.005
Like, what did you achieve? Um, so I hope that answers it,

1605
01:06:02.065 --> 01:06:03.205
but like, I guess,

1606
01:06:03.365 --> 01:06:06.285
I guess the headlines are you're in such a sweet spot,

1607
01:06:06.765 --> 01:06:08.045
honestly, being a woman in this space,

1608
01:06:08.045 --> 01:06:09.205
there's not enough of us here.

1609
01:06:09.625 --> 01:06:13.885
Um, I love championing other women and shouting 'em on and,

1610
01:06:14.065 --> 01:06:16.085
and here's that being kind thing, right?

1611
01:06:16.235 --> 01:06:21.085
Like, I, if I see a woman dressed like in a cool outfit,

1612
01:06:21.145 --> 01:06:22.925
I'm like, oh my God, I love her outfit.

1613
01:06:23.065 --> 01:06:24.885
You know, as opposed to like, what is she wearing?

1614
01:06:25.425 --> 01:06:28.365
Um, so we can, we can be that energy out there

1615
01:06:28.425 --> 01:06:32.165
and supportive of each other too, and build each other up

1616
01:06:32.165 --> 01:06:34.165
because the, the men are lining up to help us.

1617
01:06:36.485 --> 01:06:37.495
That was awesome. Athena.

1618
01:06:37.875 --> 01:06:41.055
Um, can I say something that you, you made me think of that,

1619
01:06:41.055 --> 01:06:42.455
uh, is unrelated to being a woman,

1620
01:06:42.475 --> 01:06:46.015
but it is related very much to the insecurity as a buyer.

1621
01:06:46.515 --> 01:06:48.335
And if you feel like all these other people

1622
01:06:48.335 --> 01:06:50.495
with finance backgrounds and MBAs are out there

1623
01:06:50.795 --> 01:06:53.615
and you just don't have the knowledge that they do, um,

1624
01:06:55.215 --> 01:06:58.855
I think it's fair to say that what a seller might be looking

1625
01:06:58.915 --> 01:07:00.495
for, I'm sure if you,

1626
01:07:00.555 --> 01:07:01.895
the more knowledge the better, of course.

1627
01:07:02.595 --> 01:07:06.215
But what they're looking for is your ability to learn.

1628
01:07:06.555 --> 01:07:08.695
So if you can demonstrate, um, not

1629
01:07:08.695 --> 01:07:10.255
that you already know everything,

1630
01:07:10.555 --> 01:07:13.015
but you're somebody that can learn quickly and, and,

1631
01:07:13.075 --> 01:07:16.255
and cares about learning even in, in your interactions

1632
01:07:16.325 --> 01:07:18.775
with them over the course of weeks, if you can, if they,

1633
01:07:18.775 --> 01:07:21.175
they can perceive a delta that you've,

1634
01:07:21.205 --> 01:07:23.775
that you've gone from not knowing something a couple weeks

1635
01:07:23.775 --> 01:07:24.935
ago and you're talking to them again

1636
01:07:24.935 --> 01:07:27.495
and now you know more, um, you know, they,

1637
01:07:27.495 --> 01:07:30.615
they don't really expect you to know everything already.

1638
01:07:31.035 --> 01:07:34.095
Um, but if you can, but, so if, if you can somehow broadcast

1639
01:07:34.095 --> 01:07:35.135
that you're somebody who can

1640
01:07:35.135 --> 01:07:36.335
learn that, that's what they're asking.

1641
01:07:36.875 --> 01:07:38.655
Not do, does this person know hvac?

1642
01:07:38.835 --> 01:07:41.815
No, they're asking, can this person learn how to do

1643
01:07:42.435 --> 01:07:43.535
how to own this business?

1644
01:07:43.875 --> 01:07:46.095
So however you can think about broadcasting

1645
01:07:46.095 --> 01:07:48.095
that you are a teachable that you learned,

1646
01:07:48.675 --> 01:07:49.695
et cetera, you get

1647
01:07:49.695 --> 01:07:50.695
It? Okay. So I'll

1648
01:07:50.695 --> 01:07:51.375
build on that

1649
01:07:51.615 --> 01:07:53.415
'cause I'll, I'll tell you exactly how to do that.

1650
01:07:54.395 --> 01:07:56.815
Uh, Alex Hermo defines intelligence

1651
01:07:56.915 --> 01:07:59.255
as the rate at which you apply new

1652
01:07:59.255 --> 01:08:01.415
knowledge, actually putting it to action.

1653
01:08:01.675 --> 01:08:04.815
So those of you that take everything from today and you go

1654
01:08:04.815 --> 01:08:06.135
and do something about it tomorrow,

1655
01:08:07.045 --> 01:08:09.175
technically are more intelligent than people

1656
01:08:09.175 --> 01:08:10.815
that get the knowledge and do nothing with it.

1657
01:08:11.275 --> 01:08:14.135
The most addictive thing to somebody later in their career

1658
01:08:14.235 --> 01:08:17.125
that's looking to hand over their legacy is giving someone

1659
01:08:17.145 --> 01:08:19.125
advice and seeing them go do something with it.

1660
01:08:19.785 --> 01:08:21.365
So one of the things that I al

1661
01:08:21.385 --> 01:08:24.045
and we'll talk about this in part two, like how

1662
01:08:24.045 --> 01:08:26.405
to endear yourself and whoever the, the woman was

1663
01:08:26.405 --> 01:08:28.245
that asked the question, like, please come to that.

1664
01:08:28.245 --> 01:08:30.645
Because again, we have a distinct advantage with

1665
01:08:30.645 --> 01:08:32.125
how we can create relationships,

1666
01:08:32.825 --> 01:08:37.085
but having them tell you their story will endear them to

1667
01:08:37.775 --> 01:08:39.125
being a finance bro.

1668
01:08:39.265 --> 01:08:41.245
And going in and being like, what happened

1669
01:08:41.245 --> 01:08:43.885
to your margin in 2022 in May

1670
01:08:45.225 --> 01:08:46.445
is actually something to do.

1671
01:08:46.515 --> 01:08:48.885
Like, it's, it's gonna do worse for you as opposed to like,

1672
01:08:48.905 --> 01:08:51.365
Hey, how did you survive COVID,

1673
01:08:51.475 --> 01:08:52.685
tell me how you got through it.

1674
01:08:52.985 --> 01:08:54.645
You know, like, what did you learn from that?

1675
01:08:55.065 --> 01:08:57.005
Having someone tell you their story

1676
01:08:57.025 --> 01:08:59.005
and what they learned makes them think like,

1677
01:08:59.005 --> 01:09:01.245
this person is gonna be a great person to hand over

1678
01:09:01.305 --> 01:09:02.805
and they're hungry for knowledge.

1679
01:09:03.225 --> 01:09:06.325
Ask for feedback. Like I tell my clients every time you put

1680
01:09:06.325 --> 01:09:08.445
an offer in and it doesn't get chosen, find out why.

1681
01:09:09.305 --> 01:09:10.925
And then the brokers are like, that's great.

1682
01:09:11.045 --> 01:09:12.205
I love that you did that. Like,

1683
01:09:12.285 --> 01:09:14.085
I hope the next one we can do something together.

1684
01:09:14.345 --> 01:09:18.905
You know? Um, it it's, it's addictive

1685
01:09:19.125 --> 01:09:20.585
and, and, and it's frustrating.

1686
01:09:20.725 --> 01:09:22.145
So, you know, the, the,

1687
01:09:22.405 --> 01:09:24.465
I'm gonna talk about the pick your brain sessions

1688
01:09:24.485 --> 01:09:25.625
and the asking for coffees

1689
01:09:25.625 --> 01:09:27.905
and stuff like that, like people that are in demand

1690
01:09:27.905 --> 01:09:30.425
and don't have a lot of time, but have a lot of knowledge.

1691
01:09:30.495 --> 01:09:32.825
Like, it's frustrating to give someone advice

1692
01:09:32.925 --> 01:09:36.225
and go watch them do absolutely nothing with it, you know?

1693
01:09:37.005 --> 01:09:39.945
So people want to continue to help you when you go out

1694
01:09:39.945 --> 01:09:41.945
and do the thing that they, they're like, go try this.

1695
01:09:41.965 --> 01:09:43.785
And you're like, okay, I tried it. Here's what's happened.

1696
01:09:43.975 --> 01:09:44.975
Give me more.

1697
01:09:45.695 --> 01:09:47.885
Yeah, yeah, absolutely.

1698
01:09:48.385 --> 01:09:51.005
Um, everyone, there's a link again to the webinar.

1699
01:09:51.625 --> 01:09:54.165
Um, and yeah, so, and we're,

1700
01:09:54.165 --> 01:09:57.525
and we have it called tactical e, tactical EQ

1701
01:09:57.525 --> 01:09:58.965
to win over sellers and brokers.

1702
01:09:59.305 --> 01:10:01.965
Um, and that is on October 9th. So register there.

1703
01:10:02.345 --> 01:10:05.925
Uh, Athena, we gotta let people go. Um, any last question?

1704
01:10:05.985 --> 01:10:08.525
Any last thoughts before we do?

1705
01:10:08.585 --> 01:10:10.925
Um, no, this has been a lot of fun and,

1706
01:10:10.985 --> 01:10:15.645
and I hope you guys are seeing that you can have fun and,

1707
01:10:15.665 --> 01:10:16.965
and be effective in this space.

1708
01:10:17.145 --> 01:10:19.725
You know, like we don't all have to all be dry and boring

1709
01:10:19.825 --> 01:10:24.005
and serious and whatever, like being yourself, um,

1710
01:10:24.265 --> 01:10:25.365
is one of the ways that you win.

1711
01:10:25.365 --> 01:10:27.925
And it, it's one of the, the gifts of business ownership.

1712
01:10:28.645 --> 01:10:30.805
I get to choose how, how I show up.

1713
01:10:30.885 --> 01:10:32.445
I get to choose the people that surround me.

1714
01:10:32.525 --> 01:10:34.245
I get to choose the customers that I have.

1715
01:10:34.345 --> 01:10:35.765
So like, thinking about your brand

1716
01:10:35.785 --> 01:10:36.885
and what's important to you

1717
01:10:36.905 --> 01:10:37.925
and what's unique to you

1718
01:10:38.275 --> 01:10:39.605
will actually set you up really well.

1719
01:10:39.765 --> 01:10:41.445
'cause that's, that's kind of the gift of ownership,

1720
01:10:41.445 --> 01:10:42.445
