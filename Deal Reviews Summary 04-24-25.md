  Okay, let me hide all the videos. Who are we waiting on? We still need David and Ida. There they are.  Okay. All right. I'm going to give Cher access. Anke, do you want to get the agenda up and kind of fill me in on how this typically runs?  I think I added the things that I wanted to talk about in there too, but I'm probably going to need an Athena section.  I put it under Ops. Hey, everyone.

0:44 - Luke Gillespie
  Hello. Hey. we counting this as a vetting call?

0:48 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  What's that?

0:49 - Luke Gillespie
  Oh, is this a vetting call? Using the vetting team call agenda, not the deal review agenda?

0:58 - Anke Badenhorst
  I'll just move it over.

1:00 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah, sorry. It's fine.

1:02 - Anke Badenhorst
  got it. It's kind of like a combination of bits.

1:05 - Luke Gillespie
  So I'll move your action items over. Okay. I'll do it because I'll separate it. You can just remove it.

1:13 - Anke Badenhorst
  I got it.

1:14 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay. Sorry about that, guys. We'll just get one firing off every day. Anke, can you do that? And then we'll just use like some team call, but also like, you know, anything you want to talk to me about and stuff too.  And we'll make sure the agenda makes sense as we go through it.

1:31 - Anke Badenhorst
  So Anke, do you want to pull that up and take us through it?
  SCREEN SHARING: Anke started screen sharing - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/283906241?timestamp=97.610405

1:38 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Cool. First, just checking in.

1:40 - Luke Gillespie
  How's everybody doing? Great.

1:44 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Good. Good.

1:45 - Ida Badenhorst
  Okay.

1:46 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Awesome. I'm looking forward to catching up with you all tomorrow individually too. So that'll be fun. Let's see. Are my things on here, Anke?  Are they like down at the bottom? Yeah. Okay. Cool. Let's make sure we get through all of your guys' stuff.  Do we have numbers?

2:06 - Anke Badenhorst
  Is that what we go through first? That's what we go through first.

2:10 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Great.

2:15 - Anke Badenhorst
  So normally David is our sharer. He shares and goes through the numbers, but I'll do this for today. Or, you know, we'll figure out a new structure, how we're going to do this.  Okay. So what we do is normally the team starts in the order of what they added in their numbers, and they start explaining their numbers, and then we deep dive into each where there's questions.

2:43 - David R
  So David, do you want to start us off? Yes, sure. So yesterday we got 87 deals in the inbox.  Then I pushed 29 of those, and then I did 21 RFIs.

3:00 - Ida Badenhorst
  were the passenger's arebels. And then I signed a 9 in the 8th, and we only got three SIMS yesterday.

3:09 - Luke Gillespie
  Okay, I didn't review any SIMS.

3:13 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  I did four broker calls. sorry, before we go into the numbers, can you guys tell me, David, let's go back to yours and tell me if there's any variances in what the normal numbers are, or if these are all normal and to be expected?

3:29 - David R
  Yes, it was a little bit low, the deal flow, but it wasn't too low. was kind of, I mean, there are a few days that are lower than on other days, but it was in the normal range, I would say.  So it was fine. Then the deals that I usually push are around 20 or 30 deals per day. And then I do RFIs almost like 20, 25, 30.  he did. Depends on the specific day. So yesterday was a normal day as well.

4:06 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay, great. Thank you. Okay, Ida, let's do the same thing for you. Tell me if there's any variances or any things that are different.

4:16 - Ida Badenhorst
  The NDAs sometimes differ depending on if they're easy NDAs, if it's documents I have to download and fill in and send back to the broker.  But I try to do anything between 5 and 10 a day, just to make sure the flow is going.  It was higher, but I brought it down a bit to focus a bit more on off-market. Sims 3 for a day is not very good.  I like aiming high. As you guys can see on the 16th of April, we got 15 for the day.  I like getting between 7 and 10 for the day. That is a good flow for me. So 3 is low, which usually just means I...  Pick up the NDAs, and then the next day the CIMs pick up.

5:04 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay, great. And then just a question on the two days that you were off, who was looking after those two numbers?

5:13 - Luke Gillespie
  It was a mix of all of us. Which number specifically do you mean NDAs signed and CIM received?

5:21 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Correct.

5:24 - Luke Gillespie
  That would have been, it was all of us, but since it was only two days, we didn't really have time to do NDAs or CIMs because I already had enough calls booked up that I was doing write-ups for and doing calls for and I already had enough CIMs in the bank.  And I think David was helping Ida's on the front-end side of things, signing the NDAs. Or no, not signing NDAs, pushing RFIs.

5:46 - David R
  Yeah, pushing RFIs.

5:49 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay, so we did not sign any NDAs or receive any CIMs on Friday or Monday?

5:57 - Ida Badenhorst
  No. No. But we did. I did walk into about 300 emails. I still have about 100 to go through, booking them to a deal.  So the RFIs continued, so there was a lot of backlog I had to do on Tuesday, and I'm still going through them.

6:19 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Cool. So it sounds like the process, we didn't get that figured out before Ida left by the looks of things.  Is that correct? So we were supposed to be covering all this, so there was no interruption in the workflow.  And it looks like there was an interruption in the workflow. So what do we put that down to? Where was the breakdown in terms of the ask from my side for that stuff to keep happening and why it didn't happen?  And it's okay if it was workload or whatever, but the reason why I'm asking is because we had a plan for there to be no interruption.  There was an interruption. So how do we correct it?

7:00 - Luke Gillespie
  Going forward to make sure this doesn't happen again. Yeah, it was just a workload problem. And I think we as a team had said, and with Ryan, we said this as well, that, oh, it's only two days.  So not signing in DAs for two days won't sink the ship. Because I had already front loaded all my work for Monday and Friday, a bunch of broker calls and write-ups.  Ida and I had worked together on that. So that was our thinking and process. Yes.

7:29 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay. Was that different than the ask that I made on our deal review call?

7:37 - Luke Gillespie
  I believe so, yes.

7:39 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay. What could have been done in that instance then when Athena asked for something and we make a decision differently?  And I know I'm not saying this is anyone's fault here, but I'm saying for future reference with the team that we have now, what do you think we should do in that instance when we make a decision that's different?

7:57 - Luke Gillespie
  We should have said on that call when you brought it up that... That might not be realistic or how we maybe had to come up with a different plan.

8:05 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah. So like at the very least communicating it or telling me, you know, what the plan was and letting me sign that off so that, you know, an ask that I make directly and very specifically isn't not followed and I'm not notified of it.

8:23 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah.

8:23 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah. So, you know, again, you guys are on the front lines and if an ask that I'm making isn't realistic, I expect when I ask something and we agree that it's followed through and then it's done.  So then, you know, it's a good communication style and you guys are managing upwards with me like, hey, Athena, I know you said you wanted this and this is why we're going to be doing the daily calls and that sort of thing.  So we can bring that up. And it's good communication back and forth when there's, you know, 60 hours worth of work and you only have 40.  So is it OK if we do this? And then I might be like, well. What about if we did this instead?  So just giving me the option to understand, you know, when I ask for something, if it can't be done, let's talk about it and then figure out.  And then I can either sign off and be like, I agree, I see where you're coming from, or I still want this to happen.  So what else could we put to one side or what can we do to make sure that it happens?

9:20 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah. OK.

9:22 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Excellent. OK. And I said no blame here. You know, it wasn't it wasn't anybody's here responsibility to tell me this stuff, but I am going to start communicating my expectations now that I'm going to be involved in these meetings.

9:36 - Luke Gillespie
  What I like to see going forward. Sound good?

9:39 - David R
  Cool.

9:40 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Awesome.

9:41 - Ida Badenhorst
  OK, great.

9:44 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  What were you going to say, Ida?

9:46 - Ida Badenhorst
  Would you like me to give the handover document a bit earlier, maybe like a week earlier? And because usually when I set up a document saying what to ask to give who and maybe it'll help.  I give it like a week or two earlier instead of just maybe a few days.

10:07 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah. So there's certain things that are like time sensitive in terms of client communications and stuff that need to be done like around the time.  But this is something with Anke's bandwidth freeing up a little bit with Kate, you know, looking after me is that she can help with like operationalizing and making sure there's a good process in place for handover.  So if the things that you do, Ida, is the same every time, which it kind of is, it's like a process thing, then we can try all different things.  Like how do we allocate the workload? How do we cover this and make sure that it's covered? So when we have somebody that is going off on vacation, which David, your next Thursday, Friday, is that right?

10:50 - David R
  Yeah. Right.

10:51 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So I want you to get with Anke and talk about what that might look like, and then she can make decisions on who she thinks.  It's best resource-wise to cover those things, or you can suggest things, and then we make sure that that work is not covered, because we cannot have no deals coming in for two days.  So that will cause a huge bottleneck on the whole system. So let's try it again. Anke, if you can work with David on a handover, and I would love for us to get to a, you know, this is what's expected in a handover.  Like, here's how you do a handover. So it's really clear so everybody knows, like, when you do a handover, here's the components that you need to include, here's when you need to get it to us by, here's who you need to get it to, so that we have time in these calls to be like, okay.  So by Monday next week, I would really like to be discussing who's going to take on what from David, because we know that Wednesday is going be his last day before he's off for two days.  So yes, Ida, I love that thinking, getting it early. I think Monday is probably a reasonable time for us to just kind of look at David's tasks and then how we...  Start to allocate that, we'll work on that in these meetings, too, to make sure that, you know, there's going to be no interruption because we've worked so hard, and we, being you guys, on reducing bottlenecks that we want to keep that going and get this, like, keep this volume going so it's not like somebody leaves and then they have a bottleneck again, right?  Like, bottlenecks are going to interrupt the rest of the system.

12:28 - Anke Badenhorst
  Okay.

12:29 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Cool.

12:30 - Anke Badenhorst
  Sounds good.

12:32 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  All right. Let's carry on.

12:34 - Luke Gillespie
  All right. Keep going. I didn't get to any SIMS yesterday. I had four broker calls. Didn't get to write-ups.  I started them, but I don't finish them, so I didn't count it on that day. And then no clients passing beforehand over.  Did two client introductions on Chris for a security guard business and SP for a, like, laryngitis business. I forgot the term for it, but the business.  His name is Swallow Safe. No lost or passed after handover to be updated. And then these are Ryan's numbers, or were Ryan's numbers.  And as for variances, not really. My days kind of vary sometimes because sometimes they're super broker call heavy and then very write up and send review heavy, So not much of a variance, although this week you might see a little bit less write ups.  That's because it was the last week of the month. Basically, we had to do some prioritization for SP and BH because starting Monday, we didn't have any write ups for SP yet.  So we had to do a little bit of prioritization that threw off the efficiency a little bit, but we're on good track now.  I got a second one for BH and I only need one more for SP.

13:52 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay, fantastic. And then the SIMS reviewed. So how much are sitting in the bank now with you not reviewing?  Any yesterday and today?

14:01 - Luke Gillespie
  It was 10 last time I checked, and like I was, because we were prioritizing, I was viewing them, and most of them were for JG or something like that, or CM, you know, we already bought these guys like four deals this month, so I had to prioritize SP and BH, but that's something that I was doing before, was not getting to the sims every day, but Ryan and I, well, we were going to talk about it tomorrow, but I've changed my schedule and priority list to make sure I'm emceeing the sim bank every day.

14:30 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay, fantastic. Then, okay, so how did you make two client introductions, but there was only one, is that only one write-up this week?

14:45 - Luke Gillespie
  Well, so the client introduction is when the client accepts the deal and tells me to introduce them to the broker, so it doesn't happen on the same day, you know?

14:54 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay, so how long was the timeline between when they got...

15:00 - Luke Gillespie
  The write-ups and when they accepted the deal and we made an introduction. Depends on the deal and the client for that Chris security business.  I want to say I did that write-up on Monday or Tuesday maybe, so maybe a day or two for that SP, Swallow Safe business.  That was a couple weeks ago. SP had been so occupied with their towing business, they didn't even respond to the write-up.  And then I went and asked them again in the Slack channel, and now I introduced them to the broker.

15:29 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay. Do we know if they missed it or like what happened?

15:33 - Luke Gillespie
  No, SP said in the messages, I said, sorry, we were so busy with match-it towing, we didn't even really think about any other deals.

15:42 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Interesting. Okay. What do you think would be a reasonable timeline for you to chase clients when they haven't responded to a write-up?

15:50 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah, Ryan and I just came up with this like last week. think it was, within 24 hours, if they don't say anything, I hit them with another message.  Hey, were you thinking the broker's waiting for us to let them know what you think? So we implemented that system and that increased the broker introductions.  Like you see, I first did it on Monday for all the old deals and there were four introductions that day.  So yeah, Ryan and we planned on doing 24 hours and I might not be able to get to every deal deal always in exactly 24 hours, but I'll be checking what deals are outstanding for the clients and double check on them.  And now that you're overtaking Ryan's client servicing role, Athena, part of that plan was that when I messaged them in 24 hours, if they haven't responded, what do you think about the business?  Even if they reject the business on Slack, I tell them to elaborate and explain their thoughts, their objections to the business, even with a voice message, if that's easier for them.  And then I don't reject it to the broker yet until you do a call with them and then push back on their objections and get them to go for it.  And then after a call, if they really have valid reasons to object it, then you tell me, and then I reject it to the broker.

16:57 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay, cool. Oh, Okay. How are you keeping track of the ones that need a 24-hour response?

17:07 - Luke Gillespie
  On the Notion dashboard, I can check, but I'm thinking I should do a better job of just writing it down on my list, and I'll have that somewhere on my personal notes, my to-do list of like what, or actually no, I can look at the numbers here and see what write-ups I finished and presented to clients that day and then check in the next day is where I can.

17:27 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay, I'm also kind of asking, looking at Anke, is there something that we can do to help with keeping track of this?  Slack automation.

17:41 - Anke Badenhorst
  Yeah, was going to say that the quickest thing that I do is Slack has this remind me about this section, so when you send the message, you can say remind me about this tomorrow.  So, when 24 hours goes, it's going to give you a ping and you can see that it was there.  Conversation about this, yes or no. That's like the quickest thing for Luke only. For an overview, what I was working on earlier in this week was putting up a basically like a write-up dashboard so we can literally see what all of the active write-ups is and all of the clients in one view.  And it's easy to just glance at it to see what deals we need to start pushing the clients on or asking them instead of – because I felt like I had no overview on what deals the clients had active without having to go into each and every dashboard and to see which deals is active.  I wanted like an overview of the active write-ups on the client's dashboards. So we can have a stage in there that's not just write-up submitted to client.  It could be write-up submitted to client, hand it over so we can see. All of the write-ups that hasn't been, I mean, that's actually the HubSpot stage, isn't it?  We have HubSpot stages for these. And I'm just duplicating different views now. Sorry, guys, I'm thinking out loud. Athena, I'm hearing you.  I will think about the best, easiest way to do this because we have a HubSpot stage for this. So technically, when Luke moves it into submitted to client, it can literally have a 24-hour automated reminder.  To just put a task up. Okay.

19:34 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Can we add the number in here, too? Because I'm interested, like, how long they're waiting to respond. And if we're tracking this over time, are the ones that are responding more quickly actually getting these deals under offer, right?  So it's not just like, it's not checking up on you, Luke. It's more interested in, like, does that play out when they...  Take four days or whatever, two weeks to respond to a deal. And also, like, just tracking, like, as we know, every single write-up's worth $3,000 right now.  So they're not responding and doing anything with it. It's a valuable asset that I want to know what's happening with it.  We all want to know what's happening with it. So, and then if there is a stage in it, that should help your workflow, Luke, to be able to go into that stage every day on HubSpot and just, like, do I need to send a message on all of these?  Yeah. It's already a stage there.

20:36 - Luke Gillespie
  Exactly.

20:36 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah. Okay. How does that feel? I don't want to, like, add more work, but if there's already a stage there, I like the reminder that Anke did.  And then let's figure out a way that we can visualize it so we can see what's happening with the deals that we've handed over and they've not responded.

20:53 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah. Yeah. That sounds like a good plan. And then just to be able to keep that HubSpot stage updated, it's really important.  And for me and you, Athena, to communicate when you get off a client call to tell me or for me to review the notes if we're rejecting a deal or not, because Ryan and I weren't very good at that.

21:12 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah. So one of the hires that, I mean, in the meantime, we're going to have to do it amongst ourselves, but one of the hires that I'm hoping to make is a customer success manager that's reviewing all the client notes and taking all the action items from them.  But I think in the meantime, it's going to have to be a collab. Probably Kate helping me with the assist and communicating to you guys any actions that come from that.  And with the numbers, too. So these numbers will have to figure out how we allocate these and who's best to be updating them.  So, yeah, sounds good. And Luke, thanks for being up for, you know, collabing. I think I think it'll be good and we'll figure out a way that works well, that we're not stepping on each other's toes and we're keeping each other.  So, yeah. But think Updated on what the client statuses are and it might be worth adding to this meeting for me to like for a section for me to just make any like quick client updates on like deal box or things that issues that came up or things that we need to do so I can communicate that with the team since I'll be doing the weekly meetings with the clients.

22:32 - Anke Badenhorst
  Okay.

22:35 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okey dokey. Okay, so we don't have the numbers from client call with owner LOI submitted. Let's see, Gilles LOI submitted, is that that number yesterday?

22:49 - Anke Badenhorst
  No, that's Jason. That's JG. These needs to be put over in notes. Um, Gilles submitted. Bye. Was it a light evening?

23:03 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, it was either Monday or Tuesday he submitted with his, no, it Tuesday after Buyers Club, and then he just resubmitted it again yesterday.  There's got to be, Anke, I really want you to look into the emoji thing that, like, there's, like, something you can do in Slack where you can put an emoji on something and it creates an automation of some sort.

23:29 - Anke Badenhorst
  Got it. And you want, like, LOI emoji or something that's, like, for these milestone-y types of messages.

23:39 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Exactly. So that the team, like, as we're going through, like, Luke might see that they are going to a broker call and, like, Luke's going to be working with the clients a little bit more on, like, getting them a broker call.  So when they have that call to just click an emoji when they have it, like, they message and they're like, I've got the broker call or it's scheduled for blah, blah, blah.  Then, like, what I'm trying to do is, like, how do we... Just create automations for, like, we need this information and we need to keep on top of it, but also, like, without interrupting our normal workflow, can we click an emoji and then it helps us, like, gather that information to be putting it in here.

24:15 - Anke Badenhorst
  Yeah, lovely idea.

24:16 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  I'll look into it. Cool. Okay. So, yes, Gil sent an LOI either yesterday. He resubmitted it today. Okay. And I'm not sure if there are any client calls with owners.  I've just been focused on getting all the clients scheduled in with me into a regular cadence. So I will be taking over Ryan's numbers.  Just bear with me for a day or two to make sure I get on top of things so I can start implementing them accurately.  And, Kate, I might need your help with doing this. Okay. Great. Anything else on these numbers for the on-market?  Nope. Okay, cool. How about off-market?

25:06 - David R
  All right. So for the off-market, we got three responses yesterday, but only one lead.

25:14 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay.

25:20 - Ida Badenhorst
  I didn't send any reading questions yesterday. I only sent one today. That was the JJ from HubSpot sequence.

25:34 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay. Are these numbers normal or how are they, like, just give me, you know, in addition to telling me what the numbers are, like, how are they tracking in terms of normal?  And I know off-market, we're trying to ramp up, but are you guys happy with these numbers?

25:52 - Ida Badenhorst
  Disappointed? They need to get better? You're feeling great about them? I feel disappointed. Last week was better. We took all of the older deals in the off-market and run a sequence through them again.  So the vetting questions was like two to three a day. And the calls that I booked for Ryan was like one a day.  So I can actually see that it's going down. And yeah.

26:20 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So why do you think it was higher compared to this week?

26:25 - Ida Badenhorst
  I think because last week we took all of the older deals, which was over 100, and we put them in a sequence again.

26:35 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So is that an insight for us to think about with future deals? Is that a way that we get results?

26:41 - Luke Gillespie
  Or what can we learn from that?

26:44 - Ida Badenhorst
  Yeah. Definitely. Definitely. If someone didn't engage with us with like a month or two, put them in a sequence again, especially the stage that says check back later, I put all of those in a sequence with David too, and they actually respond.

27:01 - Luke Gillespie
  I was going to bring that up when we reviewed the sales training. That's one of the most important things I learned from that guy.

27:08 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Oh, good. Okay. I can't wait to hear about that. So, David, how about you? What is your interpretation of the higher numbers last week and what learnings we can take moving forward?

27:19 - David R
  Yeah, I agree. I think we have to do this re-engagement because probably some people are not ready or maybe they didn't see the message before.  Because some of the messages probably go to spam or something like that. So when we do the re-engagement, there is a chance that they see the message or they are just ready right now to have a conversation about this.  So I think it's a good idea to keep re-engaging people and trying to catch them probably in the future.  but try to keep the conversation active so we don't lose these leads that probably are not ready yet. So yeah, I think that's the reason because we did this re-engagement and we got like a lot of leads last week, but this week it was, you know, less or fewer people we engaged with these sequences.  So we only had mail change and the normal strategies running. So it was a fewer people that we got engaged.

28:23 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So is there a way to automate the re-engagement then so you guys don't have to remember?

28:33 - David R
  Um, yeah, maybe.

28:38 - Ida Badenhorst
  I know the re-engagement sequences is like one day apart and then three days and four days and then I think six days.  So there's like five, five outreaches in, I think, in two weeks time. And then after that, we still have everything.  We can just run them in a sequence again.

29:00 - Luke Gillespie
  let's go. Well, we need long-term follow-up, not this one, two, three-day follow-up. This is what I was going to say when I bring up the highlights I learned from the sales training.  This guy, when he was most successful in his sales job, 50% of his monthly sales were coming from long-term follow-up.  Those weren't clients from a month ago or a week ago. They were clients from four to six months ago.  And that was half of his sales that were coming in. So that's just to hammer in how important long-term follow-up is.  And long-term follow-up, not short-term follow-up. Like maybe a monthly email, maybe every three months an email, something like that.

29:40 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Really great insight, Luke. Is that something we can start experimenting with?

29:47 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah, I was going to, I was going to bring this up again when we, when we talked about the sales training, but I, from what I've leaned, I think that is truly like the most important gold mine in our off-market process.  And Ryan's not here to verify, but I'm pretty sure just about every single off-market deal that we've done a write-up for and handed over to one of our clients was a long-term follow-up.  It was not something that just came in at one try. So we've already seen it in our own evidence how important this long-term follow-up is.  You know, Pino for Joe, Tariq for Ryan, the Scales business for Chris, everything was most off-market leads were all long-term follow-ups.  So I think this is like one of the most important aspects and it's put a lot of effort and attention to detail in it.  We definitely should come up with a consistent system, like a consistent stage in HubSpot that can automate these follow-ups like once every three months or six months.  I think it's very important. Um, so, and so David and Ida, is definitely a lot on your side and Anka, um, cause I'm the one who will be really working the deals once they're in front of me and you guys are.  To work the deals when we're still trying to get them, you know, in front of me and Athena and the clients.  So just something to think about. Because, you know, what I think of is a problem we have at this company, and it's what I'm 110% guilty of it as well, is letting things slip through the cracks.  Because we deal with such volume, we have so many deals. I talked to so many brokers, I can't chase this one broker.  I hand over so many deals to our clients. I can't chase every client on every deal. We let a lot of deals fall through the cracks.  But those deals that maybe were an initial no and could be a long-term follow-up and a yes in the future is going be so important for us.  What I think of every deal when I'm maybe too lazy or too busy to really put in the extra effort onto it is that deal, that could be a $70,000 deal if our client closes on it, you know.  So one deal, one extra email reaching out could be $70,000. So that's kind of something that I've been thinking about.  Is that letting deals slip through the cracks, fall through the cracks, it's a problem we have just because we deal with such volume.  But this long-term follow-up, if Athena agrees with me, would heavily emphasize it's very important for our off-market surge.

32:14 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, I agree, Luke, and I like the enthusiasm around this and also how you're looking at it. You know, we pay for every single lead, too, so every single one of these owners is something we paid for.  So we want to make the most of that investment. But correct me if I'm wrong, because you guys are on the front lines with this, but in my head, we just add more emails to the sequence and extend the time, right?  Because as soon as someone responds, the sequence stops. So if we set up a sequence, it's like this, you know, first two weeks, and then it's every month.  And, you know, like checking in and, like, eventually they might respond to it, but keeping them on a drip and just extending the timeline and, like, you know, you can make a sequence.  Like over a year. And when they respond, it's going to stop the sequence. So it, and like I said, I might be oversimplifying it because y'all are on the front lines, but that's, that's the way that I'm kind of thinking about it.  If we were to set up sequences, what's stopping us from just making it a year long sequence.

33:17 - Anke Badenhorst
  Yeah, exactly. That was my exact thought, Ida. So Ida and David, we can work together on what those timelines would be, what the messaging should be.  And then what the active sequence is, is that the correct sequence is to be adding the extensions on or should we be adding like a cold sequence?  Like these are a cold drip. They're definitely not responding to us. You know, we're just putting it on a long drip.  So we can definitely think about that. And then we can have like a, I want to say like a rule in terms of if, if a deal has been dormant for, let's say five days or 10 days or whatever we decide.  Timeline should be, that contact needs to be in a sequence. So then that way we'll know that nothing falls through the clock.  So everybody working on their stages in the pipeline, if that deal, if you, you know, just needs to check if it's in a sequence, that way we'll know everything is being touched, even though the deal is just sitting there.

34:26 - Ida Badenhorst
  There's also a few deals in the off-market, everyone has a space, but there's a space that was Ryan's responsibility, that is usually when he, after a call, he sends an NDA and he gets financials.  I haven't really touched those, so I was thinking maybe we can just go back into those, identify if we can do manual follow-ups on those, because I know Ryan said, you know, not really to touch them, that he calls them.  So there is a few in stages that I don't work in. That I can go in and see where they are.  If I'm not sure about something, bring it up to Athena and she can say if the deal's worth it or not.  And then we can also put that in the sequence. Or maybe because we've already interacted with them, we're going to have to decide on how to interact further with them because Ryan already talked to them.
  ACTION ITEM: Create collab doc mapping current off-market process. Include responsibilities, templates, communication channels - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/283906241?timestamp=2113.9999  So if we're going to do this, we're going to have to do like a handover back to Athena.

35:24 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, all good thoughts. So actually on my list today was to give you all an assignment on the off-market specifically, which is to, as the process stands now, I want a map of who does what, what our processes, what our templates are, you know, so that I can kind of get an overview of like, what are we doing here?  Because we have that really tight for on-market, like I know exactly kind of who does what. I don't think we've defined that for off-market.  So I want Anka to take the lead in coordinating you all. Kind of feed in so that we can see what does our process actually look like?  Who's doing what? Who's responsible for what? And then I also want to see the templates that we're using, the responses that we're using, the messages that we're using, so that we can do a deep dive on the whole off-market process and see where we can tighten up some of these things.  Because now that we've been doing it for, you know, a year and a half, there's certainly a lot of insights that I have that I haven't necessarily fed in.  And you guys are getting insights from doing, you know, these things and these calls. And I imagine there's a lot in that pipeline that has just gone stale that we haven't really reengaged or followed up on.  So, you know, what Luke said kind of breaks my heart a little bit that everybody, you know, that we're not, that we're letting things fall through the cracks.  Because it's not at all what I envisioned for this business. And I don't think we need to be that way.  So I want us to not identify that as that now, right? Like. None of us are those types of people.  We have high follow-through. We're not going to let things slip through the cracks going forward. So now we just need to identify where those cracks are so we can fill them up and just tighten up the process.  But it starts with us getting an overview of like, well, how does this all work exactly? Like, what is our understanding of the process and who does what and what we're saying to people and that sort of thing?  And then making sure it's kind of in alignment with the vision that I set initially for how this off-market process was going to work.  So I just want to make sure that all of my experience when I was doing it. So Luke, it's interesting you say all of our off-market leads came from long-term follow-ups.  When I was getting off-market leads, they did not. I was able to get them pretty quickly and put them in front of clients and get clients under offer on off-market opportunities that I sourced.  So there's just, you know, different ways that we can look at this, but agree that we should not. I'll be letting anyone get away from us.

38:02 - Luke Gillespie
  And when you say the sales training, are you talking about the closers training, the follow-up there? Whatever you shared with me, Anke?

38:08 - Anke Badenhorst
  Yeah, yeah. I shared with them closers, cold email training. So I shared three with them. The first one was the cold training.  That's the most important one. And then I added two more. The second one was, I think it was a sales 101 crash course.  It was just like a crash course. And then the other one, I think, was more based focused on cold calling.  So those are the three documents, but they started with the cold email one first.

38:38 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, those trainings are exceptional. And there's a lot more trainings that I want to pull in the mix. But let's start with, so, you know, the way I want to structure the meetings is that, like, probably Monday through Friday, we'll do this.  We'll go through daily numbers and just daily troubleshoot. And then on Fridays or a day of the week, we're going to deep dive onto something.  So... So... So we're going to look at a process as a deep dive, like for example, off market. Let's look at it as a team overview.  What's happening? How can we tighten that up? Or we'll go over like deals that were lost. Why were they lost?  What can we learn from that? What do we want to implement? So most four days of the week will just be daily check-ins like this.  And then one day of week, we'll do a deep dive overall on our process on a topic that we can all kind of collab and brainstorm and tighten up.  That's kind of how I'm envisioning it going from here. So in order for us to do that deep dive on the off market, we need to get an overview.  So Anke, that's my piece of homework for you to lead with the team's input over the next week to just start outlining everything that we're currently doing on off market.  So y'all don't need to change anything yet. Let's just kind of get an idea of what we're doing now.  And then we can choose the things that are going to have the highest impact for us to change. So this is another, when we change processes, we don't want to necessarily  So really like change everything all at once. It's like, what's the effort required? If it's very minimal effort, but like high impact, then we can make those changes.  If it's very low impact, but very high effort, then we might be like, oh, that's nice to have. We'll leave that for later.  So we can kind of get a list together of all the things that we want to change in off market, and then we can prioritize which things we want to start with.  How's that all sound?

40:24 - David R
  Cool.

40:26 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay, so we won't go too deep into these numbers now. But what I would also love for you all to do is as you're, you know, collecting all the processes as they are now, to also think about, write down, document all of the things, all of your ideas, what you want to see changed, things that are like, you know, challenges for you, kind of brain dump all those things so that we can bring that to this deep dive when we do off market.  And then we can start picking and choosing what things that we attack, right? So you all have amazing ideas.  I want to implement them. I want to hear them. So start writing those. Donald, you're going through this. Like, I think we should do this and do this and do this, you know?  So, like, I love that. And I love your ideas. And then that way, when we implement these changes, we're all on board.  We know how it's going to impact everything. We know what order we're going to do things in. So we can start doing all that.  How's that sound?

41:18 - Anke Badenhorst
  Perfect.

41:20 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Good. Okay. So let's get down to your owner call.

41:23 - Luke Gillespie
  Luke, first owner call today. How'd it go? Yeah, don't get too excited. He didn't pick up the phone, so it didn't actually happen.

41:34 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay.

41:35 - Luke Gillespie
  So what was follow-up there when he didn't pick up the phone? Say that again?

41:40 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  What was the follow-up when he didn't pick up the phone?

41:43 - Luke Gillespie
  I sent him a text. And I guess it bounced. And then I told Ida that the guy didn't pick up.  So we're going to have to reschedule because Ida is the scheduler. And to be fair, Ryan had canceled this guy's call last time.  I think Ryan kind of ghosted him. So Um, uh, yeah, but this, this happens a lot with these off-market calls.  would happen to Ryan as well, right? Because a lot of these off-market owners, when we schedule a call with them, it's me on the phone telling you, asking him like, oh, would you be free Friday at 3 p.m.?  And they're like, yeah, I should be free, I should be free. And then we send them the calendar invite.  mean, they still say yes on the email, but you know, these, these boomer owners, they're not really checking calendars and things like that.  So yeah, an unsuccessful outreach to them.

42:29 - Ida Badenhorst
  He was actually on my list because usually when this happens, I reschedule with him. But because Ryan interacted with him, I do it to Ryan's email.  And I, um, I just wanted to know if I'm still allowed to use Ryan's email, because otherwise we got, I'm going to have to use the Athena email and do a handover to Luke.  Um, because Ryan was the last one that interacted with him.

42:55 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  I hear you. Um, um, I, As like little as possible, I think we need to like not use email.  So think about solutions where we don't have to, or we can introduce Luke into the message. So just a message from him like, hey, I want to introduce Luke.  He's going to pick up the conversation from here sort of thing.

43:21 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah, I met him on the phone.

43:24 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So you can just use my email. Yeah, okay.

43:27 - Ida Badenhorst
  So hang on a minute.

43:30 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  This happens a lot. What are we doing to avoid the no-shows? Or what could we do if we're not doing anything?

43:44 - Kate Kelley
  I could make an offer in a suggestion that I experienced at another place that it was similar. They had a very specific type of call that had a high no-show rate.  And the solution they implemented that seemed to help was sending, I want to say it was like an automated.  Like even 30 minutes before the call, like a text reminder, or maybe it was an hour before, but it was like really close that that text just went out, like looking forward to seeing it in like 30 minutes or whatever.

44:13 - Luke Gillespie
  And that seemed to help. I don't know if we have something like that. It's been on Anke's bucket list.

44:21 - Anke Badenhorst
  I'm unable to get that as an automation, but what we decided and told Ryan to do was because he's prepping and Luke's going to be prepping for these owner calls before he goes into it.  So about 10 minutes or so before the call, he's going to have the deal open. He's going to be looking at the materials, whatever there is, five minutes before the call, sending a text saying, hey, this is Luke.  Luke, I'm going to be calling you in five minutes, just so that guy picks up the number and he knows what the number is from, and then he can call him.  But I don't think Ryan ever implemented that to send out the five minutes.

45:00 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Before taste. Okay, and could we do anything else?

45:06 - Luke Gillespie
  Have more quality leads, so we wouldn't have to do calls.

45:11 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  No, I mean on the calls that are scheduled specifically.

45:14 - Luke Gillespie
  What else could we do? Well, we talk to them on the phone. I meet them and build rapport with them.  schedule the call live on the phone with them, and then we send them the email calendar invite, and they say yes on the email calendar invite.  So a text reminder is great. We could try an email reminder as well.

45:37 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, do you think five hours before is enough?

45:40 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah, probably not. Maybe 24 hours before, and also like one hour before. I also add these people on LinkedIn after I get off the phone with them, just to get my name in front of them as many times as possible.  But yeah, maybe a 24-hour reminder, and then also a one-hour reminder. Would be good.

46:01 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah. So let's write down these ideas when we go through the process, right? Like, because it sounds like there was things that we wanted to do that weren't implemented.  Also like good ideas, because again, like they agreed to do a meeting, but we know those owners are out in the field.  don't necessarily remember five minutes before they might be already engaged. So, you know, for my sales calls, how many reminders do we send Anke?

46:31 - Anke Badenhorst
  It differs per call, but, you know, I can at least say there's a 24-hour text reminder. Then there's a three-hour-before-the-call text reminder as well.  So it's at least text reminders 24 hours before, three hours before the call. And that's on top of email reminders that goes out 24 hours before the call as well.

46:55 - Luke Gillespie
  Are those all automated?

46:58 - Anke Badenhorst
  Nope. Nope. That's me. I can do that.

47:04 - Ida Badenhorst
  I don't mind doing that because I'm the one that's scheduled and interacts with them. So it'll just really help because I think it was Wednesday, Ryan went into a call, and the guy wasn't prepared.  was like, oh, I forgot about it. And then we scheduled it to Friday, the one that he's going to have tomorrow.  So that would actually really help.

47:23 - Luke Gillespie
  So you can make it as on your to-do list, like one of the first things you do when you start your morning, you just look at my calendar and see all the calls I have.  And you send an email text for all those calls and say, hey, hope you're, you know, you have your call scheduled with Luke to talk about the potential acquisition of your business at whatever time.

47:43 - Anke Badenhorst
  No, no, no. Just keep it short. Just keep it short. Like I'll give you guys the text that we use in sales.  So keeping it short. So it's just like, hey, this is Luke looking forward to our call tomorrow. So that's the 24-hour reminder.  And then the three-hour reminder is just going to be like, speak to you soon. Because you already said, hey, this is folk.  Nobody reads long text messages. So we're going to keep them short. But I'll share with you guys the sales scripts that we use on those reminders, and we can work around that.

48:13 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay. So again, first task is, Anke, let's get a document that we're all collaborating on to map out the process as it is now, and who's responsible.  And then let's start adding in these ideas of things that we can do. And when we go through this, we can decide who does what, and what we actually want to implement, what resources that we need to pull in and share.  Because we all have a lot on your plate already. So I don't want you running off and doing these things, because it's already going to be a bit of a lift for us to try to document everything as it is now.  But benefit of documenting things is we can create an SOP, and we can bring in more team members and train them on stuff too, as we dial it in.  So it is to all of our benefits, because it helps us to get more resource to help us out.  But I love these ideas. And I want to do a deep dive. As I already said, I was going to do an off-market training with you guys, but I think this is better.  We can oversee the whole process. I can, you know, feed in. Anke can feed in. Anke has been, you know, overseeing our sales process, and this is a sales process, you know.  And then there might be some additional trainings that we can assign to each of you individually when we decide who's responsible for what from our sales training resources and stuff like that that will help each of you get ideas for the individual things that you're going to be looking after.  So I love this. Cool. Okay. So all these problems, too, when we get in these daily meetings, we're going to start seeing where there's patterns, like owner notion, owner notion.  And then we can be like, okay, well, in our deep dives, like, let's look back at the numbers last week.  And are we seeing a recurring issue? Like, how can we deal with that? How can we come up for solutions for that?  Instead of process and trial different things. So I'm excited to work on this with you guys. I've been, you know, I've been harping on off market for a long time.  So I'm very excited to actually get in there, get back in the kitchen and start trying out different recipes.  It's one of my favorite things that we do. And honestly, it was one of the things that I loved the most when I was just the only one doing all of the things that you do was the owner calls.  Like, they just gave me so much life. You know, these people are amazing humans and built really amazing things and they have incredible stories.  So like, Luke, you're going to get the benefit of like hearing just really exceptional things, you know, and like people that have built businesses that have been in existence for like 20 years and the stories they have and just how wild they are.  And just it's so fun. It's so cool. And like, that's what gives me life is thinking like, I'm going to introduce this person.  To somebody that's going to look after their baby, you know, it's not going to be something. So that comes in and  cuts everyone and tries to like increase the multiple or buy a bunch of them and sell it off to private equity.  Like, there's a lot of meaning to these interactions, at least for me, I seriously personally connect with them. And the more that we do that, right, because we, you know, most of what we're doing is through brokers.  So we kind of don't get that personal interaction with owners as much, but like the more that we focus on off-market, the more you guys will get to and it's pretty special.  Like, it's really exciting too. Okay, cool. Anke, what else is on our agenda for today?
  SCREEN SHARING: Anke started screen sharing - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/283906241?timestamp=3107.21025

51:43 - Anke Badenhorst
  Okay, let me pull up the agenda again. All right, so it looks like Luke has a question or has a statement?

51:57 - Luke Gillespie
  was just going to update you on write-in progress. I already mentioned. I'm agenda. you you But everyone has their minimums so far except SP.

52:03 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  need one more. Nice work, Luke. And six days before the end of the month. Well done. Anyone that we've overshot this month or how many have gotten above the minimums?

52:14 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah, a lot. I mean, technically, we average out all the write-ups. Right now, it's like 2.8 write-ups per client by the end of it because I'll get one for SP and then probably more.  Well, not every client will have gotten three write-ups, but every client would have gotten an average of three write-ups.  JG got three. DL got four. CM got three. GL got four. Jason got three. JJ got four.

52:41 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, those were our... Oh, .

52:43 - Luke Gillespie
  JJ got four. Yeah, those were our outperformers.

52:47 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yes, Luke. She was worried.

52:50 - Luke Gillespie
  Is she digging into any of those? She wants to submit an OI on one I gave to her yesterday, I think.  I read the notes on the call with Ryan. The fact... She just said that she wasn't going to submit an LOI.

53:03 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Fantastic work. That's what I'm talking about. The manufacturing plant is doing its thing.

53:11 - Luke Gillespie
  You guys are putting in the work and now we're seeing the results of it. Doesn't that feel good?

53:17 - Anke Badenhorst
  Yeah.

53:18 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  How many write-ups are we at total? I didn't even look at that number.

53:22 - Luke Gillespie
  I have 28.

53:24 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Wow. And what was our highest in a month?

53:29 - Anke Badenhorst
  That is our new highest.

53:31 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  I know, but what was the one before that?

53:35 - Anke Badenhorst
  19.

53:39 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Wow. Nice work.

53:42 - Ida Badenhorst
  Can you imagine that broker calls? It was so much.

53:49 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  But we have a theory, right? If we get Luke on more calls, we'll get more write-ups. Like, Ida was the one chasing all those calls.  You did that. David was at the front end making sure that we had a lot of deals coming through.  For Ida to do that with, your system of scheduling and calls, and then, you know, it's like the high priority ones just get scheduled rather than waiting for it.  Like, so those things that you guys implemented are working. This isn't, you know, Luke obviously is at the end of it and doing the write-ups, but he wouldn't be able to do that without having the team passing in the ball every time.

54:21 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah.

54:23 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  It's awesome. So, like, it's working. You guys are doing exceptional work. I'm really excited.

54:30 - Anke Badenhorst
  I'm proud of all of the things that you're doing to improve this process.

54:36 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, it's amazing. Okay, cool. Ida, what are your discussion points?

54:44 - Ida Badenhorst
  BH sent a listing this morning. We sent us a sim for something, and then I went hunting for it online.  I found the listing, and I got the sim for us. I signed the NBA, got the sim, and we created a deal for that.  It's currently in the sim bank. I'm not sure exactly how BH works, but I'm pretty sure Orlando wasn't in his, in what he wanted.  So we have a deal that BH wanted. We got the deal. We're not really sure how to handle this.

55:20 - Luke Gillespie
  It's not your fault, Ida. BH, he knew the guy who was selling the company and he had told BH.  And Athena and I have been talking to Brian about this in the Slack channel. So you did your job.  You're good, Ida. Thanks for inquiring. Without us even asking, you read our mind and we'll be pursuing it and kind of waiting to hear back from, from Brian.  I think this is the clever ways that Athena talks about it. It's the second time you did it in like one week, Ida.

55:46 - Ida Badenhorst
  Good job. Amazing. I was just, I was so afraid that we missed it. I spent like an hour digging through HubSpot, trying to find that deal.  Because why would we miss a deal?

55:58 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah, that's how I feel when, when. When clients send deals, too, yeah.

56:02 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  I love that y'all feel that way. Like, that's good, right? But Brian actually got sent this from his friend.  I was like, how did you find out about this?

56:11 - Ida Badenhorst
  And he's like, oh, my friend told me it was coming to market. Oh, that's why I couldn't find it in First Choice.  I went to all of their deals. had like 200 of them. I tried to figure out if it's a different name because why didn't it come up in our system?  So, okay. But we do have it now, if you want to do a write-up on this, I'm not sure how this works.

56:36 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Oh, he's, his communication style is not the clearest. So, you know, Luke will give me the conversation, but I'm trying to work out what he wants.  Because he's like, he's saying that his SBA lender won't lend on it, but the SBA lender is a broker.  about. about. So I'm assuming it's a broker that has like relationships with SBA. He's like, he's also a lender.  And I'm just like, how did you get a loan in the first place? But he takes action, you know, so he did write me privately.  And so just so y'all know, I contacted all the clients privately to update them about and that I'd be taking over services from here forward or direct contact with them.  And Brian, let me know that he will be ending services at the end of May. So we have the rest of this month and next month to continue delivering him deals.  I'm going to see what kind of support that he wants in terms of this deal. Like if he wants Luke to do a write up or whatever.  So I'm trying to get to the bottom of what he needs here. Cool. What was your next point, Ida?

57:55 - Ida Badenhorst
  I'm not sure if the SBA letter, Anke, but it is not in the SBA. And I'm pretty sure it was there.  I think David mentioned maybe it was there. I need the SBA letter to get SEMS.

58:12 - Anke Badenhorst
  Okay. I'll check up on previous comms if it's not there because I remember a few months ago or something we had the entire call around should the SBA pre-call be put up on the, you guys remember on the investor profiles and that, you know, we had that conversation.  Yeah. then we checked all of the letters. So I'll put that on the list for us to just make sure.

58:38 - Ida Badenhorst
  I don't usually use the SBA letters just when it's like a really high priority deal and the broker asked that we deliver proof of funds.  I just sent them the SBA and they give us the information we need.

58:54 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  I'm wondering, Anke, like, did we actually go through the process with BH because he if don't it going. Thank And I  We tried to buy a business at first, and then we didn't know what was going on with him.

59:06 - Anke Badenhorst
  We did go through the process with him. It's just, I think what happened with him, it's just, like you said, his communication style.  So he ghosts us. He ghosted us on so many different messages. I'll just have to go back on the Slack channel to see where was that conversation left off?  Did he maybe send a letter? And I never put it in the drive. Was it in the drive? David says he saw it in the drive.  So let me just go back through the comms, email, and Slack, and see if I can find out where that process was left off.  But I definitely did do the SBA thing. Like, if even I absolutely introduced him to Wendy.

59:48 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So I'll just double check. Okay, great. I'm conscious I'm keeping you guys late. So let's keep rolling through this.  And we will get shorter as we get caught up and go through. Process and that sort of thing. So we'll keep these on track going forward.  So thank you for bearing with the changes. And, you know, they might be a little bit longer as we're getting up to speed and I'm getting back in the kitchen and reorganizing things.

1:00:12 - Ida Badenhorst
  But we'll have a very efficient Michelin-level kitchen before we know it.

1:00:19 - Luke Gillespie
  BH wants our LOI template. He just messaged it in Slack if you saw that.

1:00:23 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Oh, okay. It's on his dashboard. So we can just point him in the direction of the dashboard. Great. So he's just going to go forward with it.  Sounds like. Oh, he's a character. He's wild. Okay, cool.

1:00:45 - David R
  Yeah. I'm next. So this is something that Anke mentioned to me yesterday. And I think it's about JV, JSON, and BH because they are ending services with us.  So we need to to stop the on margin. So I need to communicate this to Masam. So I just wanted to know when do we stop the on-market search for that?

1:01:07 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Off-market or on-market?

1:01:09 - David R
  On-market. Off-market is already a ripost. It's already stopped. But the on-market, we're still getting, you know, deal flow for them.

1:01:18 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay, good question. So what is the shortest amount of time that a deal hits the inbox and becomes a write-up?

1:01:32 - David R
  Hmm. I think it's more than a week.

1:01:36 - Luke Gillespie
  It's happened in 24 hours before.

1:01:39 - David R
  Really?

1:01:43 - Luke Gillespie
  Ida, nowadays with everything in the mix, how much does it really take?

1:01:46 - Ida Badenhorst
  Ida would know. It depends on how long it was in Notion. But if it comes from Notion to HubSpot, you should be able to get it done within 24 hours.  Otherwise, you have to start chasing. If it goes well, you can get it enlisted 24 hours.

1:02:03 - Luke Gillespie
  So best case scenario, two days.

1:02:06 - Ida Badenhorst
  Yeah.

1:02:07 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay. And then you're able to get a SIM, have a broker call, get a write-up done within two days of a deal.

1:02:17 - Luke Gillespie
  In the best case scenario, yes.

1:02:20 - Anke Badenhorst
  Got it. I think three days. Like, if David, deal hits notion, David RFIs within 24 hours, Ida receives SIM, then she's going to book the broker call, probably not on the same day.  It's going to be the next day. And then when Luke has the broker call, he does the write-up on the same day.  So I would say, realistically, guys, we're looking at three days minimum.

1:02:43 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah.

1:02:48 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So then, we, okay, so Brian's not ending until end of May, so we're going to keep that going. JB and Jason are ending the end of this month.  I mean, I have a call with Jason on Tuesday, but based on how he's been interacting, I'm not going to be pressing him to stay on.  I'd rather focus our energy and efforts into the clients that appreciate us and treat us well and don't pass our deals off to family members.  But, you know, live and learn. learning what qualities are indicative of good clients. And, you know, those of you that are into stats know that 10 isn't a super meaningful data set.  So, you know, we're learning things. But so JB and Jason, I've got final calls with them next week. They will be ending services on the 30th.  So then do we stop horrifying on Friday or Monday? What do we think?

1:03:56 - Ida Badenhorst
  Sunday?

1:03:57 - David R
  We'll say Friday, yeah, because... On Monday, there will be also the weekend's deal flow, and then Monday, I think it's too much deal flow for them.  So probably Friday is good. I can just push everything, and then Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, we can work on those different deals.

1:04:16 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Great. And then does that also mean that any deals for – because I'm assuming there was probably crossover between Jason and SP.  So do we divert any of those over to them now and increase their deal flow?

1:04:35 - Luke Gillespie
  That'd be great.

1:04:36 - David R
  Yeah.

1:04:38 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay. So, David, why don't you look at that, make a plan to end Friday, of day, so then Luke and Ida, you can still keep doing what you do, but let's not take any broker calls past Tuesday, I'd say.  So then that gives you time to do a write-up. So You're able to turn on a write-up on the very last day.  Luke, what do you think?

1:05:09 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah, that sounds good. I mean, we already got JB the best deal possible and flaked on it, so not really worth putting effort into JB.  I think Jason, if we got something good, he would continue. So if anything, I'd have to put extra effort into Jason.  But yeah, closing on Friday, and then just keep working up until the end of the month of work.

1:05:33 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay, I'd say let's not schedule any broker calls past Tuesday, so that if you have a broker call Tuesday, it gives you some time to get the write-up to them, and we can get some final feedback on them from Wednesday.  But like I said, I will not be continuing Jason at this point. We have a 30-day notice period. He gave us his 30-day notice period.  So that's how I'm feeling about that. Thank So I would not expect he's going to continue.

1:06:03 - Luke Gillespie
  All right.

1:06:03 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Sounds good. Cool. But again, Luke, like we deliver for all of our clients. So even though JB got scared on another deal, I have to seriously question if it was the right deal for him.  You know, like you never know the right deal. People react very differently. So we want to continue to deliver high value until the very last day.  Same with Jason. But I'm, you know, at this point with the call, it's like he gave He's noticed it's very hard for us to react so shortly.  So he's going to have a drag on deal flow anyway, because we've stopped the off market research. Like we don't have off markets plugged in for him.  Is that right, David?

1:06:42 - David R
  Yeah, that's right.

1:06:43 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah. So like there's a, there's an impact on the overall business when they, you know, drag it along like that.  It's not, we're very respectful of our time and our boundaries and our requests as a business.

1:06:56 - Luke Gillespie
  So.

1:06:56 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Uh huh. But we still. You know, so we're going to deliver all of our services until the very end.  We're going to be outstanding. We're going to do it for Brian, too. You know, we all get salaries because these folks paid us.

1:07:12 - Luke Gillespie
  True.

1:07:13 - Anke Badenhorst
  Yep.

1:07:14 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Great. Okay.

1:07:19 - Anke Badenhorst
  Nita?

1:07:21 - Ida Badenhorst
  Oh, off-market. I created an off-market document to start putting in some templates. Anke mentioned it to me yesterday, two days ago.  So if there's any off-market templates you guys want to add or we can change. Some of them we're going to have to change because there's a whole section that's just, you know, for Ryan.  So if I just, I do for him, but it's just something we can start on and build out. If you guys want to add something, please see, I did make the link open and it is available for everyone.

1:07:54 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Amazing. Thank you, Ida. Let's get this plugged into the overall SOP process doc. That Anke is going to create.  And yeah, if there are messages that you all are using that are templated, are related to off-market, great idea to get that.  Like all the copy. Do you all know what I mean when I say copy? I know it's a word that, was that the word Anke that we had to?

1:08:18 - Anke Badenhorst
  You had to explain it to me. I was like, what's copy, Athena?

1:08:23 - Ida Badenhorst
  Copy like duplicates.

1:08:24 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  No, so copy is a word to describe written words, right? It's like that templates that you have, like all the words that are in there is copy.

1:08:42 - Ida Badenhorst
  That sounds like an ancient word. You are working with Team V now.

1:08:48 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  From my branding background, that's what we call it. So like one of the assets of a brand is copy that you use to describe it.  So the copy is, you know, the description itself. It's the words that you use. texture. know, So it's a word used by editors, it's a word used by brand managers, it's probably an American thing.  David, don't know if you're familiar with that word.

1:09:11 - David R
  I used to call it copy or caption, depends on the social media, you call it like captions, and then copy is just like general words for marketing or branding or whatever.

1:09:26 - Anke Badenhorst
  I'm not sure if it's this specific document, but David also added a document for all of the verbiage and the messages being used in both the mail, called mails, and expandly as well, just so we have an overview of what's being sent as well.

1:09:42 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Amazing, thanks for taking the initiative on that.

1:09:45 - Anke Badenhorst
  You too, I appreciate it.

1:09:49 - Ida Badenhorst
  Yeah, I have a lot of questions here. Okay, so the first one was when I said earlier, Luke had a call with the guy today, he didn't answer.  I need to know. How to respond, because Ryan was the one that was interacting with him.

1:10:05 - Luke Gillespie
  This is my email, and try to schedule another call. said, hey, you missed that call with Ryan the other day, can we hop on a call sometime, whatever works for you.  So you just do it from my email and try to get a call with him.

1:10:20 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay.

1:10:22 - Anke Badenhorst
  Yeah. You were the one, right? So you already have a relationship with the...

1:10:27 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah, yeah, exactly. Yeah, yeah.

1:10:30 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  I'm going to almost reach out as Luke, and like on the email chain and be like, hey, it's Luke.  We spoke originally. Ryan asked me to reach out to follow up with you. Would still love to have a conversation if you're interested in, you know, talking to me about potentially selling your business.  Just leave it at that, right? And then maybe text too. So, like, if we're not texting these things, then we should be.  So... Um, not that you need to implement it now, but I'd also like to see in our process doc, like what channel these comms are going on.

1:11:08 - Ida Badenhorst
  Okay, great.

1:11:10 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Because we might need, and what we've done with the sales process is we have a whole text script that we use that is complimentary to the email script and we hit them on both.  So what I need to see is what you guys are doing so far. So I feel like you need to change anything, but if you also do texts or whatever, like, then we need to have that kind of side by side.  But yeah, like jumping in as Luke and being like, hey, we spoke, Ryan asked me to get in touch, would love to chat with you.  Keep it simple.

1:11:41 - Ida Badenhorst
  Yeah, that sounds, that sounds actually better. Okay. The next one is a call that Ryan is supposed to have with the owner next week.  He already did a call with this guy. I think I scheduled this for him last week or maybe Monday this week.  He already had a call with this guy. guy. But there's like a second call he's going to do. So I did tell Anke about it.  I just need to know if you're going to do the second call, if this is a Luke thing, maybe you can just review the recording.

1:12:15 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  There is a recording?

1:12:17 - Ida Badenhorst
  I hope so. I mean.

1:12:21 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  We're finding out that there was a lot that weren't recorded.

1:12:24 - Ida Badenhorst
  So let's first find out if there's not different. The one from Sir Reid yesterday also wasn't.

1:12:29 - Anke Badenhorst
  I hope it was recorded. There is a recording. Notes says he's 81. It's too much to handle on one call.

1:12:39 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So that's why he scheduled another call. Okay. Luke, why don't you put this on?

1:12:45 - Anke Badenhorst
  When is the meeting? Next week in...

1:12:50 - Ida Badenhorst
  The 1st of May.

1:12:52 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Oh, look at who this is.

1:12:57 - Anke Badenhorst
  Sorry?

1:12:58 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Who is this? What? What? Or is this?

1:13:02 - Luke Gillespie
  Ron Wilson.

1:13:04 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Do we recognize this? I recognize this logo.

1:13:10 - Luke Gillespie
  If you zoom in, I can't see.

1:13:15 - Anke Badenhorst
  The company logo, Athena.

1:13:18 - Luke Gillespie
  Can you click on the website?

1:13:20 - Anke Badenhorst
  Oh yeah, that's probably the best deemed.

1:13:26 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Let's go back to the emails and see what we see here.

1:13:30 - Ida Badenhorst
  We said one of the older outreaches.

1:13:37 - Anke Badenhorst
  So this is just going back and forth on getting a date. Valuation and then outreaches. Let's go into Ron Wilson himself.

1:13:55 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Is this not the octogenarian?

1:13:59 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah, he's in. One, that's what Ryan wrote in the notes.

1:14:03 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Is this the email where we told him that he wasn't a fit?

1:14:09 - Luke Gillespie
  No, I don't know. I haven't seen this deal this week.

1:14:13 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Do you remember the email I was talking about, you guys?

1:14:15 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah, that was the big one.

1:14:18 - Anke Badenhorst
  Wasn't that a trash sentence? I think that was a trash sentence.

1:14:23 - Ida Badenhorst
  about the call that he had earlier this week or last week? Were you talking about an older deal?
  ACTION ITEM: Review Ron Wilson deal transcript. Prepare next call strategy synopsis for Monday's vetting team call - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/283906241?timestamp=4469.9999

1:14:30 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah, this isn't that one, Athena.

1:14:33 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Oh, okay. It looks very similar, that A. Okay, just completely ignore me then. All right, what was the question?  Okay, so there's been a call already. We need to figure out who's going to have the next call. So when is the next call?

1:14:52 - Anke Badenhorst
  May 1st.

1:14:54 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  May 1st, so next Thursday. Okay, so Luke, I want you to put it on your list. Okay. Review this whole deal, the transcript so far.  And then give me a quick update on the next vetting team call that we have. can wait until Monday if need some time.  Just a quick update on where it's at and what you think the next call strategy should be. Because I think you can handle it.  But we talked through overall strategy and what the steps are. So why don't you review it, see where Ryan got to, and then just bring a quick synopsis of what you think the strategy should be for the next call.

1:15:35 - Luke Gillespie
  Yep.

1:15:35 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Sounds good. Perfect. Okay. Great. What else is on the list, Anke?
  ACTION ITEM: Compile list of 2-3 JQJY deals Ryan was reviewing. Bring to next call for Athena to review - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/283906241?timestamp=4538.9999

1:15:41 - Anke Badenhorst
  Okay. I you already asked this question.

1:15:49 - Ida Badenhorst
  Yeah, but there's a few deals that Ryan had that he said he's going to take a look at. Because we ran the sequence again, there was a few JQJY deals.  That the owners start showing interest, but they were ones that Athena already did a call on last year, so Ryan said that he's going to review them, take a look at the deal, and then come back to me and say how I should reach out to them.  So I just want to know if it's possible that I can make a list for you guys, what they are, so you guys just can know where to take off.

1:16:25 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, how many of them are?

1:16:28 - Ida Badenhorst
  I think there's like two or three. Oh, bring it to the call, and then I might even remember them if they're people that I've talked to.  Yeah, you'll definitely remember them.

1:16:37 - Anke Badenhorst
  Anke remembered them. I was like, hey, Scott.

1:16:42 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay, great. So if you bring them to the call, I'll remember them. I can consult on strategy and then have Luke pick up and get in touch, or maybe it needs to be an introduction from my email, like, hey, I want you to talk to Luke or something like that.

1:16:56 - Luke Gillespie
  So yeah, bring them. Okay, Do it. Okay, next, I was wondering what happened with Tariq. This is Jason's Skylight manufacturer deal, the off-market one in Atlanta, because Tariq had called us and then Ryan was supposed to call him back.  Ryan called him back yesterday morning. I see they had a nine-minute call. Ryan wrote down in his notes. He says that this guy's such a narcissist.  He's the, I'm an accountant guy, Athena. know, he's, this guy told Ryan that he feels the deal, the deal fell out because the lender didn't want to work with Jason and that Jason wanted to hire an operator and put no money down.  He didn't mention anything about very fine financials. I, Ryan, told him to work with us. He will need to have monthly income statements for the past 12 months or SBA won't lend.  He said he would put those together and get back to it. So, sounds like to me, unless you were updated on this before, Athena, this could be a chance for long-term follow-up.  And in a few months or something, maybe three, we get three months.

1:18:00 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Can reach back out? Here's my problem, right? I also know that Jason has his own version of the truth.

1:18:10 - Luke Gillespie
  So, like, I don't, I haven't had direct interactions with Tariq. Yeah.

1:18:17 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  But, like, the way he, like, the way it was being told to me is that he was having a crisis of identity.  I don't know if that makes him a narcissist, right?

1:18:27 - Luke Gillespie
  And just be careful with how we label people, please. Oh, yeah.

1:18:34 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So what he's saying is just completely different from what Jason was telling me. So now I'm like, well, we need to figure out what's going on there.  Because if, were you privy to the discussion that Brian had with the deal that Justin was working on? And then speaking to the owner and seeing where they were both off track in their understanding of what was happening?

1:18:59 - Luke Gillespie
  Was that the... This deal or the furniture deal?

1:19:01 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  It was a landscaping deal.

1:19:04 - Luke Gillespie
  Oh, JQ.

1:19:05 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, JQ. Oh, yeah.

1:19:07 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah, I know that.

1:19:09 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  With these things, right, like because emotions get in the way, then people's interpretations of the details get interesting.

1:19:17 - Luke Gillespie
  So like we're kind of in the middle, like trying to figure out how we problem solve or troubleshoot there.

1:19:23 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So I'm like, that's interesting that he like, how would he even know or say something that like Jason didn't want to put any money in and wanted to put an operator in place?  Right. And you weren't in the conversation before, but one of the things Wendy flagged me, she's never flagged anything about clients with me before, but she's like, I'm worried about Jason because he seems to think he's going to get somebody in to run the business.  Yeah. So how would a seller replay that back to Ryan? Right. So then I'm like. So I want to have a conversation with Jason and see where that's at.  And then I will probably pick up with Tariq myself because he's a guy that had an identity crisis. He's very proud of him being a CPA and being personally reached out to by the founder and CEO of the company he's been dealing with might get a different story.

1:20:20 - Luke Gillespie
  All right.

1:20:21 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  also, I think with this is this is, you know, older, retiring age men, if they have daughters and they talk to a woman, they like do not perceive women as threats.  You know, they see them as someone they want to protect and help. So oftentimes we can get a lot of different information out of somebody that was feeling like every interaction with a man.  Right. Right. Men tend to perceive as threats and they don't want to like, you know, this whole alpha thing.  And I don't want to da da da da da. They don't have to do that with women. So sometimes we can.  Different information. Not saying that across the board, but just like a boomer generation tend to be very protective of women and in a good way, like, you know, so he might, and he might totally be just making things up.  I don't know, but I'm interested to get the story from both sides. So this is one that I want to have a conversation with Jason about and then reach out to Tariq myself and also speak to Toonie, find out, because Toonie's interacted with him and see if I can get, you know, some semblance of the truth in between all those conversations.

1:21:38 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah. Yeah. Sounds good. You're right. There's both sides to every story.

1:21:43 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Absolutely. Okay, cool.

1:21:45 - Luke Gillespie
  What else can I help you with? Anke, you pull up the screenshot I just sent in the Zoom chat?  This guy on Xpandy, we reached out to him saying, hey, we have a buyer in Ohio that would be interested in buying your business.  And he's... I said, tell him I want to buy him. So I was thinking about how to respond to this.  My idea, Athena, was to just keep it casual because he kept it casual. was going to be like, ha ha.  So you're interested in buying a business and you don't want to sell your business? Perfect.

1:22:23 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Then see what he says and we can figure out the next message.

1:22:26 - Luke Gillespie
  All right. Sounds good.

1:22:27 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  I am done with my questions. All right. Cool. Okay. So what was left on the list? So also, I just want to give you a quick update on Andrew.  spoke to him before Buyer's Club. So the SOP guidelines. It's a big impact on our clients. So all that work that you did on their buying power and everything, we're going to have to look at that again because they're going to need to bring...  So... 1% to a deal, which sucks massively. I'm trying to be positive on the call today, but some of these SOP guideline changes are pretty .  I'm hoping the investor thing is not a PG situation. So that's what I want to try to figure out because giving a little bit of equity away to get these bigger deals done may not be a bad thing.  I'm interested to see how the market adjusts on pricing now since everybody's going to be in the same boat that they need to bring 10%.  So, first of all, was everybody clear on my explanation? Did that all make sense? Do you have any questions about the things that I shared about the SOP guidelines?

1:23:50 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah, know. So the SBA had to get stricter because they were kind of throwing out some bad loans. And so just to confirm, right?  a lot to epiully, I'm to know, And to use a seller note to use as an equity injection for that 10% will no longer work.

1:24:06 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Correct. Unless the seller's willing to wait for 10 years instead of two, which most of them won't.

1:24:12 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah, that's huge for us.

1:24:15 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Wow. Yeah. The other thing is the licensing. So I'm going to have it. And Kate, if you can do me a favor and just remind me for every client meeting to have that discussion.  And then we'll pull out from every client discussion how they feel about licenses, knowing that they'll have to convince the seller to do a personal guarantee.  I imagine most of our clients are going to want to eliminate businesses that have a license requirement, which would significantly impact the types of deals that we're looking at for them.

1:24:51 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah.
  ACTION ITEM: Update client buying power spreadsheet. Adjust for new 10% SBA equity requirement, incl. total project costs - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/283906241?timestamp=5098.9999

1:24:52 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Unless there's a license already in the business with one of the employees. Yeah. Yeah. You So, I'll update you as I have those conversations, but it's just something to be really aware of, right?  Like, Luke, especially for you as you're looking at deals. And then, David, we'll need to pull up your spreadsheet again and just make sure if you can update it that their buying power is, you know, essentially based on the 10% of what they can put into the deal, which means it needs to be total project costs, right?  So, if they have $300,000, then they can probably buy a business for $2.8, right? Because there's additional deal costs and stuff that go into that.  So, we'll navigate that as it comes up. I'm sure you guys will have questions as you're going through the vetting process.  Please bring those in terms of like, this is on the edge. What do we think? Also, we don't want to eliminate deals that are just a little bit priced a little bit too high because we know we can negotiate and do those sorts of things.  But if it's like a client has. If we're looking at a $6 million purchase price, it's probably not within their wheelhouse unless, Kate, actually the other question that I need to have and reiterate with everyone is if they're open to investor money.  So investor money and licenses, because investor money will open up the door for them to go after bigger deals, but some of them aren't going to want to give away even a small piece of equity.  So I need to confirm that with everybody. Okay, cool. And then Andrew, he, I had a call with him and he has some valid concerns about this off-market deal.  However, I think the prospect of, you know, putting a personal guarantee on it is probably what he's wrestling with the most, as well as his own feelings about his capability to manage a team of 28, which I think he's perfectly capable of, but he needs to arrive at that decision himself.  Um, because he could use, um, he could potentially use private debt on this one. He wouldn't have to personally guarantee it.  So it was like, if you don't have to personally guarantee it, does that change things for you? And he's like, yeah, it does.  So he's going to sleep on it. We're going to talk again on Monday. Okay. The thing to note on him and the thing that we need to be aware of from the sourcing side, he said he brought him a deal where the owner works 80 hours a week in Tulsa.  Did he feedback to you all directly? And do you know that he is not open to that?

1:27:39 - Luke Gillespie
  It needs to be in Oklahoma City and ideally not that kind of workload. Yes, he had told us that and Ryan talked to him about it as well.

1:27:48 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay. So we've adjusted the deal box since we got that feedback.

1:27:52 - Luke Gillespie
  Yes. And I, I don't believe it was 80 hours.

1:27:58 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Well, if they're, if they're saying Working 40 hours is probably 60, because they always lie, right, in the sim.  So if they did say it's like 40, 50 hours a week, then, but what he's saying is like, it needs to be in Oklahoma City.  And I was like, okay, you're talking about collateral and assets, like, are you only wanting to buy businesses that have collateral and assets?  And he's like, I'm open to a service-based business or an airball. Do you know what I mean by airball?  Is everybody familiar with that term? Yeah.

1:28:30 - David R
  No? No, I'm not sure.

1:28:32 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Great. Airball is a deal that has, like, literally no assets, no real estate, nothing. It's like, it's air. You know, there's nothing for the bank to come after.  So they call it an airball. My property management business that I raised $3 million for was an airball, which is why I had to raise $3 million, because the bank was like, $8 million.  You have no, like, you don't have enough net worth. Like, how do we get our money back over the SBA guarantee?  That's That's where the... No. The 3 million came in to cover that delta. So he's open to air balls and service-based businesses, but he's like, I can't have all these other variables like Canada, this and that.  So he's still open to online businesses and service-based businesses, but ideally looking for less hair on it, like not being an international business or dependent on an owner.  You know, like this, this off-market deal is like, it's the owner who's been coached in the face of it and that sort of thing.  But also he, you know, Oklahoma City is really important. Also, I want us to review every single deal that Ryan reached out to.  So I want a list of all the deals that Andrew had originally put in front of us, local to his town.  I want all of those deal links pulled and I want... The one that he mentioned on my call today, he said the name and I didn't capture it, but if you look at the notes, I want that deal specifically shared with Kate immediately.  I need to look at it and see what we need to do there because apparently it's live. He's really excited about it.  He's like, look, the guy is like uncomfortable with talking to someone on the Internet. If I need to go and do an in-person, I will, but I don't want that one to go away.
  ACTION ITEM: Send Andrew's local deal links to Kate. Star specific deal he mentioned for Athena's immediate review - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/283906241?timestamp=5424.9999  So I want to make sure that we're actioning that. So please get that to me ASAP tomorrow so I can look at it and I can have an update for him on Monday on what he needs to do there because that's our next call.

1:30:35 - Ida Badenhorst
  So I want it tomorrow. Is that clear?

1:30:38 - Anke Badenhorst
  That's clear.

1:30:39 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yep. Okay, well, all the deals, that one in particular, I want the one that he mentioned specifically flagged for me so that I can go into that one, see where it's at, and we can come up with a strategy on how we handle it.

1:30:54 - Ida Badenhorst
  Okay. I have all of them already, so I'll just send them through to you.

1:30:59 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Perfect. Send it to Kate. She'll put it on my dashboard so I can review them all and then just star the one that is the one he mentioned specifically.  Okay, cool. Sorry, this was a long one. Like I said, as we get going and do this more often, we'll keep them tight.  Keep doing the agendas. Anke will make it clearer. So it's only one agenda going forward. Next week's going to be a little bit of variability in the time.  We're not going to be able to set the same time every day because I'm having to try to accommodate all the clients' existing meetings with Ryan.  So I was trying to create as little disruption as possible for them. So just bear with us over the next couple of weeks.  And then the aim is that we get the same time every single day for these calls going forward. And have we got all the one-to-one scheduled tomorrow too?  Great. Okay. So I'll see you all individually tomorrow. So any questions, concerns, life chats that you want to have, like.  Come with that. I'm looking forward to connecting with you all individually. Thank you for all your commitment and hard work.  Ida, I know this is super late for you, too. So thanks for staying late today. Anytime. Yeah. Anything else you guys want to chat about before we sign off?

1:32:19 - Ida Badenhorst
  Just a quick thought I just had. Usually this time of night, I take all of the meetings Ryan had and I send the AI notes.  But since you're going to be having the meetings, do I still get access to that's nice to send to each client?

1:32:37 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  That is a good question. And one that I want you and Anke and Kate to collab on and figure out how we do there.  Because I'm having some parts of the conversations with clients that I need to have edited out of the videos before they're shared with the whole team.

1:32:57 - Anke Badenhorst
  Yeah, that's so great. If you pick it out, we will collaborate with you on how we're going to handle it specifically.

1:33:07 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay. But then going forward after next week, we will figure out an easy way to get those notes or figure out who's posting the notes while I'm having the calls.  So good thing to point out, Ida. Love the follow-through and accountability on that. We still want to get them the notes in a timely manner.  We don't have any more client calls until next week, so we can figure it out between then.

1:33:30 - Ida Badenhorst
  Yeah.

1:33:31 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Great. Okay, cool. And then just do me a favor, Kate's still learning what's kind of urgent in terms of deal stuff.  So Luke, if you see anything, tag her in, forward it to her so she can get through to me.  And then I'm trying to check into the Slack channel at least three times a day to do any sensitive things.  But we'll all collab and find a good way to make sure that we're getting the clients kind of timely.  Uh-huh. But she's And she's very quick to learn, but like in terms of time sensitivity for different deals and where they're at in the process, you know, some things we kind of need to get to immediately because there's like an LOI deadline, other things could potentially wait.  So if you see something that's like super urgent and I haven't responded to it, feel free to like tag her in or forward it to her in the deal team channel and tag her so she knows to get my attention.

1:34:24 - Luke Gillespie
  But I'm going to try to do my best at keeping on top of everything too. Okay, my Wi-Fi cut out at the beginning of that.  I jumped back in and heard notifying you of any deadline specific things in the client channels.

1:34:36 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  I sent that to Kate in the deal team channel. Did you say anything else before that that I missed?  Just that Kate's learning what's super urgent and what, you know, isn't in terms of like deal processes. So you'll probably be the best one to kind of like, hey, there's an LOI deadline.  Like Athena needs to get back to them ASAP. So if you just see anything in the client channels where I'm not responding super timely, feel free to forward it.  The Deal Team channel and tag her in so she can get through to me and I'll make sure to action that because sometimes I'll have a couple hours of meetings and then when I get to the Slack channel, like all the client channels are full.

1:35:11 - Luke Gillespie
  knowing which ones I need to dive into first is helpful. Great. And Kate, if you have any questions, just DM me and I'll let you know how important a message is or not.

1:35:19 - Kate Kelley
  Yeah, awesome. And I was just going to add, you know, some seem like obvious. I think the ones I struggle with is maybe where you already know, like, the history and the context and that's why you know that, like, so if you ever see something like that where you're like, she probably doesn't have the history on this.  So, yeah, I really appreciate your help.

1:35:37 - Luke Gillespie
  Thanks. Yeah, normally, Athena, mean, going forward, maybe you and I can try to work the same way we were when Ryan was on vacation, where any question on the Slack channel that comes that I can answer, I'm qualified to know if to answer, I'll do that.  And so only the most important ones can be left to you.

1:35:55 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, I would like to. So if it's getting them on a broker call. Or how to handle the second call.  think you've got a good handle on that. If it's making an offer, negotiation, big  challenges, feel free to send it to the deal team channel and say, Athena, I saw this.  This is what I think the answer should be. What do you think? If you feel like you know the answer, but you're not completely sure, and it's beyond where we're getting into crunchy stuff or negotiation or submitting an LOI, that's the stuff that I want to really be involved in.  But if you think you know the answer, which you might, because you're a really quick study, forward it to the deal team channel.  Tag me and say, Athena, saw Bill said this. This is what I'm thinking. Is that right? And then we can kind of like, just getting me to check off things before you send it on some of the stuff that's a little bit further along.  And as I get more confident that I've trained you properly on those sorts of conversations, we can have you jump in there.

1:37:00 - Luke Gillespie
  Is that clear where the delineation is for now? Yes, ma'am.

1:37:04 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  And don't feel pressured to do that. But if you're like, I know the answer, but I want to check it off, then you want to send it, then send it to the deal team channel.

1:37:13 - Luke Gillespie
  But don't feel pressured beyond like broker calls to feel like you need to at this point. Sounds good.

1:37:19 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Thanks. Awesome. Great questions. Good stuff. I'm feeling excited and motivated. Thank you all for all you do. Have good evenings.  And then Anka and Kate, I won't try to keep it too late, but if you want to give me two minutes and I can go to the little girl's room, that would be awesome.

1:37:36 - Kate Kelley
  If I can have five, I'll be there. Okay.

1:37:41 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  You want five minutes?

1:37:42 - Kate Kelley
  Yeah, if I can have five minutes, and then I'll be right there. Okay. Okay. Thanks, everyone. Bye. Thank you.  Bye-bye. Bye.
