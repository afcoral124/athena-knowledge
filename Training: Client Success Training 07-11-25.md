  Hi, Athena.

0:02 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  How are you today?

0:04 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  I'm good, thanks. I'm excited. Wendy and her family are coming over later.

0:10 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  Oh, Wendy from Live Oak? Oh, you guys are nearby? That's nice.

0:16 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  We're not, but where Cole and I live is near the river where everybody comes and floats during the summer.  So her family are coming here for the weekend to float, so we're going to hang out with them while they're here.

0:30 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  Oh, that's nice. Are cooking something up or making something special?

0:36 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  No, Wendy just wants to see the house because she knows how hard I've been working on it. And then we're all going to go out to dinner.  She's got a teenage son and his friend is going to be with him. And then we've got our teenager.

0:51 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  So, yeah, we're all going to go out for dinner. And that's nice. It's nice that you guys have like a meeting like that with a Wendy, like a very close relationship.  Bye-bye. I thought it was like, you guys have never met in person.

1:03 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  I thought it was just over email. I've stayed at her house before.

1:07 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  We're friends. Oh, that's nice.

1:10 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah. Oh, that's good.

1:13 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  I haven't seen her in a while, but yeah, we're friends.

1:15 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  We've shared hotel rooms and events. I've stayed at her house, you know, hung out with her kids.

1:22 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  Oh, that's nice. Growing together.

1:25 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah. Yeah. We do a lot of emotional support with each other too.

1:29 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  So that's nice to have someone with you on that belt.

1:34 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yes. How are you doing?

1:37 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  I'm good. I'm good. I appreciate you taking time for this. know an hour and a half of Athena's time is like very valuable.

1:44 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So I really appreciate it. Well, investing in you is very valuable. Also, the more we invest in you, the more of Anka's time I get freed up.  Um, she, she is our bottleneck in the business right now. So that's. That's the bottleneck I am focused on personally is how do we free her up.  So we don't have like normal training manuals and everything for this role because we're kind of creating it with you.

2:15 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  Yeah. So I'm going to be asking you to create a lot of the training materials so that like you can put something down, I can review it and then or Anka can review it.  And then we can come back and see where we left out context or training or that sort of thing.  So it's an active learning process.

2:33 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So today I'm going to talk through a whole bunch of stuff, give you a whole bunch of work to do.  What I want you to do at the end is just write down everything that you need to do and then we'll prioritize what you start on because it's going to be too much for you to attack all at once.  My feeling is the onboarding process, that is the most flushed out. That's where I need to extract Anka and put you in to all the things that she's doing because there's so many clients starting right now.  And she's focused on hearing people and stuff like that, that we just need someone that has a good handle on their journey, the timings, that sort of thing.  And it's a lot of work, even though, you know, she doesn't think it is. It's still a lot of brain spray space.  So, and you're going to be the one kind of being the glue. I keep describing you as that. You're kind of the glue holding the whole process together, right?

3:36 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  So, so it's better for you to get inserted early on and you might have to check things with her and I like every time, but I'd rather you be the voice of it to the clients.
  ACTION ITEM: Complete takeover of onboarding process from Anka within 2 weeks
 - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/349563173?timestamp=220.9999

3:47 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  And if you don't know, you come to us and we can like help you through that. Um, so I asked Anka, she's going to check, but I would like onboarding to be completely off her plate in two weeks.  check, to check, it Thank you. you. I think we can do that. What we need is more clarity around timings, who does what and when, and some of the things to be fleshed out in the onboarding journey.  So I'll see if we get time doing that today. Um, I've started writing down in no particular order, um, just client servicing things that I'm thinking about.  And then I've started writing out areas in your document that you started putting together of what we need to train you on.  Um, so it's not pretty, it's not in any particular order, but we're going to go through that together.

4:39 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  Yeah.

4:40 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  And then I want you to, you know, take notes on what needs to be action. So you're kind of project managing your own training and, um, helping coordinate me and Anka to give you what you need in order to get the information on those things.

4:56 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  Does that make sense? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That makes sense. It's what I did with the previous. Job description I had.  I had to contact Unc and Ryan to get what I needed to build this thing.

5:08 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So you've done it before, and you did a phenomenal job, and we got someone else up to speed in, you know, a couple weeks.  So, yeah, you did a really good job on that. You're really good at these types of things. So, you know, I know it's a lot, but I have full confidence that this is something that you'll be really good at.

5:30 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  Yeah.

5:36 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So, what I was thinking we could do is start and talk through the job description, and maybe just kind of talk you through some of the context behind those things, and why this role exists, and what we're hoping that they help achieve, and then we can dive deeper into the details.

5:51 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  How does that sound? Yeah, I'd love that.

5:54 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay, and then do you have any, like, questions or, like... About specific areas, or anything that's come up that you feel like I would really like a lot of, I would like more information on this particular area.  Like, is there anything in particular that you haven't been briefed on that you're feeling in the dark about?

6:15 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  I think some of the things she posted on Telegram, like the gifts and stuff like that, that's only something that I'm starting to write down.  But Anke and I haven't touched base on that. But she did go through the onboarding process with me, but not exactly when do I start what.  So every time something posts in the channel for a client, I go back into the playbook, see what I have to go do, run it by her, and then I do it.  So I try to do it like that, because I'm not sure when it's my cue to start exactly. So I try to see what I can do to ease myself into that.  I don't know if that makes sense.

6:54 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah. Um, okay. So you. We've got an onboarding slot next week. Thank you, slots.

7:10 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, I think something that I would like to know is, yeah, when I take over the onboarding, what exactly does that include?  I think that's something that I'd like to know.

7:25 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, it will be taking over ownership of the entire process. So you don't necessarily do everything on the onboarding, but that's what you need to figure out with Anka is, what are things that Anka is currently doing that you will be doing?  What are things that need to be done by team members? Who are they? When does that need to get scheduled?  So you'll be owning, making sure that that process happens and it happens well and it happens when it needs to happen.  And then everybody gets what they need from that process. So you're essentially the project manager of the onboarding process.  So you're on the calls now where Austin's doing the intro. I'm assuming you're just listening in, but that will be you.  Anka will be extracted from that completely. You'll be doing all the setup for the client stuff. You'll be doing those calls with them that are Anka doing calls now.  And then with the exception of the first deep dive onboarding call, that will be with an advisor. So you won't be running it, but you'll be on it, right?

8:41 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  Have you observed one of those yet? And not the ones that Anka did, but only the ones that he did.

8:47 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay. Okay. Okay. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Does she have one? I don't think she has one in the... Yeah, we don't have one coming up.
  ACTION ITEM: Get training from Anka on client gifts process (incl. ordering, setup, shipping) on Wed
 - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/349563173?timestamp=551.9999  Okay. Good. Okay, so you're doing training with her on the onboarding prep on Monday, it looks like. Then you have another onboarding slot on Wednesday.  If that doesn't get booked up, that's what I want you guys to go through the client gifts. And I want her to train you on, because there's a whole bunch of stuff that needs to be ordered, I need to be set up for it, so I can get those out, and we can get them sent to clients before their search starts.  Yeah. So we use that Wednesday time for that. Do you know what the client gifts are?

9:49 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  I know it's when they start, they usually get a book and a mug, but I'm not... I don't know.  I know it's just those two. I don't know if you have anything else.

9:57 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  it's two books, two bookmarks. They're branded bookmarks like Aquimatch. It's a mug and then it's a handwritten note from me.  So there's work for me to do, right? So I don't want to put on my plate last minute. It's like, Athena, I need you to do these clients because I have to pack the boxes.  I have to put them together. I have to write the note. I have to print out the mailing label, which you need to create.  And then we need to schedule a pickup. So it's a pretty involved process. And it's the thing that pisses me off the most that I'm still doing.  But until, you know, until we've figured that out again. So we used to have Maria do it.

10:40 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  Oh, yeah.

10:43 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  There's aspects of it that can make it a lot easier for me. But like, for example, Morgan's, it got sent to him.  We didn't have his complete address. So then it got sent back to my postdoc. And now I'm paying an extra, you know, $20 to have it sent back and then another $20 to have it sent to him again.  So it's really important that we like make sure, you know, we have the right addresses and stuff. So like that form being updated.  So really what you're going to do in this role is like anytime a problem happens, figure out a way to fix it.  Like overall, not just in the moment, but like what happened in that in that process that we got the wrong address.  Oh, we don't have an apartment line item for people to put in their apartment or suite numbers, right? So let me go and update the form for that.  So it's not just fix the challenge in the moment, which is your job, but it's like, is there a way to avoid this coming up again?

11:45 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  So we can just make this whole process for the client more seamless. Yeah, definitely. Yeah. That sounds nice. I do enjoy it, Athena.  I did enjoy this week so much. I know it was like one of the hardest weeks, but This was one of the most fun weeks I had.

12:02 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Why was it one of the hardest?

12:06 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  Because I had food on both sides. I still had training with Ray, had oversight. She asked a lot of questions, so I think it was just that.  But it is getting easier the more she's going on her own. So it will just be for a week or two.
  ACTION ITEM: Extract relevant portions of training video, add to playbook
 - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/349563173?timestamp=739.9999

12:21 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Amazing. Okay, cool. Let me pull up. Okay. Okay, so what I'd also like you to do is save this video and on parts where it would make sense to use it as part of the video training, grab that portion of the video and add it into the playbook.
  ACTION ITEM: Update playbook w/ cadence, checklists, timings for each process
 - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/349563173?timestamp=757.9999

12:46 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  Playbook.

12:48 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  And then something that we're, like, Anka kind of is really good at, like, process, but we still need to, the playbook, I'm going to have her standardize it, but it's missing things.  Things like the cadence, like how often and when does this happen? Who does it happen by? And what's the checklist, right?  So like, if I've done this thing, what are all the things that I check off in order to do that?

13:15 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  Yeah. Okay. Yeah.

13:17 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay. So that needs to be added to every single process, right? It's not the overall thing. It's like, okay, now I am doing the welcome emails.  What do I need to check off in order to have that done? I need to draft an email for Athena.  I need to tell her to send it. She needs to send it. Then I need to tell Austin to send his message on top of that, right?  I need to make sure that the link is open for them to schedule a call.

13:46 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  Like whatever those things are, it's like, what's the checklist? So if I'm to extract all the, if I, how do I know this thing is done?  Yeah.

13:55 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Right. And then the other thing that's really missing from the onboarding, that's a problem. Is the timings, the cadence, like what needs to happen when?  Because we're telling clients they need to turn things around in 48 hours. She's not starting her search until October.

14:10 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  Like, why are we doing that? Right? Like, oh, okay. I get that.

14:16 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So, and then like something that's still happening with the onboarding processes, we're giving them something they need to do two days before their onboarding call.  And like, I just, I don't think that's a good client experience, right? Like the setting, the destination exercise, we need to give them at least a week.  It's a thought-heavy process, usually done over the weekend. We should recommend like, hey, this is a great Sunday morning, you know, or weekend project when you don't have other stuff going on, but we're giving it to them and having them turn it around in two days, right?  So it's not going to be, it's not a good experience from the receiving end to be like, do this in two days, you know?  We were doing that before because we needed people to get  done, but. Like understanding the reasons behind the timings, like what, how much time does the client genuinely need for something?  And also, when do we need it by in order to deliver us something by a certain date? So you need to understand both of those timings in order to make a call of, okay, well, Austin agreed that we're going to start their search in August.  So I need all of this by this time. so I'm going to have to expedite things as opposed to Maggie's not starting until October.  So we don't need her to do  that quickly. And also, we want to make sure that we're pushing her onboarding as late as possible.  So it's still relevant. So if we do those onboarding sessions now, it, you know, things could change in two months.

15:47 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  Yeah. Right. It definitely makes sense.

15:49 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah. Yeah. So, okay. Let me pull up the job description and we'll start going through that. And there's more on here that we need to add.
  SCREEN SHARING: Athena started screen sharing - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/349563173?timestamp=959.008433  We kind of put this. Together when we thought we were going to be hiring somebody for this. So it's a little bit light in terms of detail of like the actual roles.  But, you know, the way I kind of see this is like, you're, you're the fairy godmother in Cinderella. Right?  So you're just bippity bopping, booing everything. Like, you're like, okay, you need this. Let me do this for you.  And you're just arriving at the right point. When they need help, but you're also like pushing them when they need to move.  And, you know, they just feel like they have a trusted person. Anytime they need a question answered, even if you're not the person to answer the question, you're, you're there, responsive, hey, I'll get the team on this or managing their expectations.  Like, hey, so and so is in meetings all day, but they are going to get back to you tomorrow.  Or, you know, that sort of thing. So you're just, if you picture yourself as that little guy that pops up with a magic wand.

17:00 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  You know, it's like, how can I help you today? That's what I see this role as.

17:04 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  And the more that they have that, you know, this magical partner that has their back and that you're that partner.  So, you know, you're keeping momentum alive. You're, you know, taking their questions and getting answers. You're helping them make progress.  Yes. Um, so, you know, there's, there's equal parts, like understanding, but also pushing in this, in this role, maybe not equal parts, but you're doing, it's a blend of both.

17:38 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  Right. So, and I think you're really good at that.

17:40 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  That's why I was so excited that you wanted to do this. Cause it's like, you're exceptional at like being thoughtful and caring, but also you're good at like, Hey, I see something's not happening.

17:52 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  at the time that I think it's supposed to be happening.

17:54 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Like, let's take action. So, um, doing. The primary point of contact throughout their engagement. So like I said, you're that person that's their guide throughout, you know, building that trust and rapport, making sure that they feel understood, cared for, and confident.  Like they're getting what they need when they need it. And like, oh my gosh, like, let's get that taken care of for you, you know, or like, that's amazing.  You have a broker call. What time is it? I'll make sure somebody reviews it before the call. So you have what you need, you know, like that sort of stuff.  And, you know, anticipating their needs and providing proactive updates, resources, and clarity. So they're getting close to LOI. Okay, what's all the crap that they're going to need next, right?  So like getting that ready, like, I'm going to have to do lender intros. I'm going to have to, I want to make sure that they're reading both the pre and post LOI process, that they understand what comes next, that, you know, they have their, their deal team, you know, in mind, that they're going to start doing those interviews.  You know, no question goes unanswered. No request slips through the crack, supporting clients as they navigate, know, keeping them on track and pulling in the right expertise to provide advice when needed.

19:11 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  Yeah. Any questions on that part? No, no, no, no. I understand. Luckily, it is something that I can keep.  This job as I see it is I see something, but and I create the solution and then I run it by you, you and Anka.  And then that's how this is kind of getting created.

19:32 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Exactly. And then as you get more of those solutions answered, the less you need to ask us about things.  Right. You just know the expectations, you know, the answer. And then that'll be great because when we hire an advisor, you'll be able to help them understand our process, what's expected of them when they need to answer.  Right. And you'll also be the guide to them. So you're not an assistant to the advisor, right? Just like you're not an assistant.  To Luke, you're just part of the team and you're the glue. So it's like, I need this from you at this point, or you need to be scheduled for this call or you know what I mean?

20:09 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  Yeah. Yeah.

20:10 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So, okay, cool. So the coordination and support is, you know, it's only for bullet points, but it's actually pretty big.  So that onboarding process, as you're seeing, is like, it's a monster. And it's really important for them to be set up for success.  And really somebody makes it like a decision about whether they made the right purchase within 24 hours of making that purchase.  And these people are transferring an enormous amount of money to us. So if we don't make them feel confident, right from the start, they're going to question whether they're getting good value, whether they made a right decision, you know, and that can make the whole process for everybody a lot harder.  If they're in defensive mode, like, what the  did I just pay for? Right? So this role is really crucial because it's like if they're getting action within, you know, like Austin scheduling them on a call within a week of them signing up, they're getting on a call and it's like, okay, here's your whole roadmap for what's coming next and what to expect and when.  So they're always trying to catch up with us, you know, so and I want this during the deal process to from this role.  It's it's never them chasing us for deals. It's always them. It's always on them to take the next action.  Right. And that's what the coordinators is going to do that I've been wanting for so long, but none of us have had the bandwidth, you know, it's like Luke drops an NDA within 24 hours.  Hey, it's been 24 hours. Have you signed the NDA? What's going on? Right. Right. Luke drops a write up like, hey, what are your thoughts with the write up?  It's been 24 hours. You need to move quickly on this. You know, Luke makes a broker introduction. Have you followed up with a broker?

21:56 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  When is your broker call? You know, like, yeah, exactly.

21:59 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  that kind of. If somebody feels chased and like they're the ones like having to take the action, then there's not the question of whether we're doing enough to support them, whether we're putting enough deals in front of them.  If they're not taking action on the things that we're putting in front of them, right, then like we're not going to give more if they're not doing the things they need to do.  Are they prepping for those calls? Like, hey, have you gotten your talk track together? Like, you know, those sorts of things.  So you're going to be basically like checking in with them throughout that. And then the advisor, the separation between you and the advisor is the advisors coming in and like that strategic, like, what do I do next?  How do I handle this thing? How do I get out of my own way? You know, so you're kind of the tactical, practical step.  So, hey, have you done this? when they're like, oh my God, the broker is a  . What do I do?

22:55 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  You're like, I'm really sorry that's happening. Let me get the advisor to get back to you.

22:59 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Right.

23:00 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  Yeah. I love that. Yeah.

23:04 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So this is also what we've started working on with you, right? So tracking and managing all the client facing tasks, the requests, the action items.  So the reason why I'm committing to it on the call is because I'm the only person on the team that can make commitments, right?  So like extracting all of those things and thinking like, is this, is Athena the only person that can figure this out?  Is Athena the only person that can do this thing? 99% of the time it's no, you know, it's like, okay, I might need to ask Athena, like, hey, how do I get this information?

23:40 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  Or what exactly did you want here? But I want you to take that, action it, and get them an answer within like 24 hours would be amazing, right?

23:48 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  That's good client service.

23:49 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  Because Gil asked us something over a week ago, I committed to something over a week ago, we still haven't confirmed it with him.  Yeah.

23:57 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  You know, if you're waiting for the founder to Remember all of the things that the team needs to do.

24:02 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  It's never going to happen. Yeah. Yeah, definitely.

24:07 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Equally, if an advisor, you know, makes a bunch of commitments and I expect this person to have follow through on what their things are.  But, you know, you'll be on those calls and it's like, OK, I'm going to get the team to do this, this and this.  You're doing this right. Or the advisors like, no, I'll do these things. This is my action items.

24:27 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  And then you make sure the rest of the team is actioning the things that they need to do. Yeah.  So what I realized yesterday with Ray's question is that we're just kind of freestyling what the upper limits are of the client parameters.  That's not OK. Oh, yeah. I understand. Yeah. Yeah.

24:47 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Right. So. But are you are you taking action on the guilt thing?

24:53 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  Yes, I am taking action on the guilt thing. Everything I've seen to you in Telegram in the beginning. I wasn't sure.  I understood. Get all the action items ready and send them to you. I'm very, I wouldn't say afraid, but I won't just take action on something if I'm not given permission to do it.  So that's why I waited for you to review the document and then you clarified to me, like, if I can take action, take action, and now I can take action on it.

25:24 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah. I thought of you do something and then I'll just correct you.

25:28 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  You know what I mean? Like, it probably feels uncomfortable because you're like, oh, I did the wrong thing.

25:33 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  You're not. You're not. I'm asking you to take action. That is the right thing. But when you take the action and I see like, oh, I didn't give her the context or I should have told her this, then that's why I'm correcting it.  It's not that you did anything wrong. I asked you to take the action because I want the clients to get that kind of activity.  And you just, they will get a better response time if you just take action on something rather than waiting for me to review a document and then get back to you on it.  And that's. Sort of thing, you know, so, but with all those action items, again, that's like part of the process, right, is like, is that, are these things that I can figure out and action myself, or with help from the team, or do I need Athena to, you know, give me clarity on, like, these two points, in which case, send them to Telegram, you get a much quicker answer from me there, and say, like, Athena, is this what you meant here, can I do this thing, right?

26:28 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, okay, so, yeah, clarity.

26:33 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  But it's good, because this is a new thing, and I have not extracted this process, or my thought process, out of my head to anyone, apart from Anka, and I need her focused on hiring, we're way behind our hiring schedule, and I need every spare second she has, focus on that.

26:52 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, on that, yeah, when you were talking, just to clarify now, when you were talking about the gill, were you talking about the, the,  Action item that said we're going to see the ceiling limit for his, we're talking about that action item.

27:06 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah.

27:08 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  And when you said yesterday in the vetting team that Luke is going to send you in the next vetting call, going to tell us what the ceiling limits are, is that the action that was taken?

27:18 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  No, that is a separate one.

27:20 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  Oh, that is a separate one.

27:22 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay. Yeah. So after that call, confirm what the ceiling limit is. Hey, Luke, what is the ceiling limit for Gil?  Come back to me. Athena, ceiling limit is this. Do you want me to tell Gil?

27:34 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  Oh, I understand. I understand.

27:36 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay. Right.

27:37 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  That was a very quick thing to do and it's still not been done.

27:41 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  And so when clients are expecting us to take an action and we take this long to get back to them, it makes them think that we're not looking at deals in the right way or we're not taking action or they're not in good hands.  Right. So it's a perception thing. If we take that long to do something that was very simple. Simple. Or they don't trust that I do what I say I'm going to do.

28:04 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  Yeah. Okay. I do understand that.

28:06 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay. Yeah. So I need the action today. Yeah.

28:11 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  I'm putting it down. I had that all mixed up in my head. Okay. I'll do that right after this.  All the other things in the action items I did, I ran it by Luke, the ones that I sent to him.  If he returns back to me, say, for instance, the JG1, where I add the Fathom node, and he returned to me and he said, it's all done.  I took a look at it. Is that something that I report back to you or something that I tell Luke to report back to you?

28:39 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Or how would you know that it's been done? I don't know specifically what you're referring to. So I need to know the item to be able to tell you.

28:53 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  Okay. It was in the JG call. Yeah, okay, I'll get it now for you. Okay. Loop in loop to assess flex-based network brokers.

29:20 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay. So what I think, so I'm struggling with the Google Docs thing, right? We'll just have to figure out a system.  But something that I'm putting in here is a weekly reporting from you. Oh yeah, I could do that. So I think maybe we add it here is what were all client promised actions.

29:55 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  And what have been done for them to be completed.

31:00 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Are you cool with that? Then I can say yes, right? But just like telling me like, Athena, here's the action item.  I'm like, okay, well, what do you want me to do with that?

31:08 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  Right? yeah. Anke explained your thought process to me.

31:14 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Putting the bike in gear?

31:15 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, she's like, Athena doesn't have bandwidth. She has a problem. Don't come with an outer solution. Get a solution.  And she can just say yes.

31:28 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  I'm like, okay. I need that. It's like, I'm thinking and solving a whole bunch of challenges and problems in the business, right?  And I only have limited brain power to be able to do that. So when somebody that I trust to make decisions comes to me and says, here's the thing.  And I'm like, okay, now I have to try to extract decision making and strategy. Okay. Okay. Okay. From the things that I've already got running in my head to solve a problem, which you were capable of solving, you know?  So it's a growth opportunity for you to think, like, what would I do? And if you're like, I think I'm going to do this, I'm a little bit unsure if it's the right thing, run it past us, right?  Don't say, like, what should I do?

32:21 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  That pisses me off.

32:22 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  And it's a bad reaction for me, but it's because I have so much that I'm trying to figure out that I'm like, oh, I don't have space for that right now, you know?  And so now I've to try to figure out how to rearrange things to create space for that. If you genuinely don't know what to do, like, we can support you to be like, I've thought of this, I've thought of doing these things, it doesn't feel right, I'm not sure what to do here.  At least show us that you like put some thought into it rather than like, I don't know, you know, like, so it's a way for you to develop your own strategy and growth.  And you see me doing that with Anka, right? She has the capability of being a leader. It is a very hard transition to go from doing, as you're told, to being the one telling people what to do.

33:10 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  Yeah. Yeah.

33:11 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So the more I can give you guys these opportunities to learn it, the easier that transition is when it's your time to do so, which it will be at some point.  You will be a leader of this business the way that you're going. So this is a growth opportunity for you, not Athena is lazy and doesn't want to do things, right?

33:29 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, I understand. So just to clarify, you'd rather appreciate it if I keep clarifying something with you guys until I exactly know what I have to do and then come with the solution and an answer for you guys just to approve.

33:46 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah. If you feel like you need us to sign it off, if it's like so-and-so asked a question, I know Luke needs to answer this, let me go back to them and get Luke to answer it.

33:57 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  You know, yeah. Exactly. I told that Anka the other day, I'm like a calculator. I do exactly what I'm programmed to do.  I just need the programming.

34:09 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  But you have really good instincts.

34:14 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  I just don't always feel comfortable. Like for instance, I have the playbook now. I know what to send in the client channels.  I don't feel like I have the permissions to change the numbers because I saw 48 hours is not, I don't have to do that.  But I didn't want to take it out because I didn't know if have permission to do that. So if you can, if you tell me I can do that and sense check it, then it's something I can do.

34:39 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Absolutely. All of this crap was developed when we didn't have a full team, right? So it might not make sense anymore.  We've never had this many clients starting all at once. We're pushing them out a couple months. So you should sense check it, right?  Like, does this make sense to me? Does this make sense to our clients? Like all of these processes, the onboarding process.  It's an old process. So that's why we want you to update it. Because now Austin's signing three to four clients a month.  You know, that's how many we had in an entire quarter before. So we had one a month that would be onboarding max.  So it's a different place. So yeah, if you're like, this doesn't make sense to me, or why aren't we doing it this way?  Or I think this would make it better. Please bring that to us. Please don't just follow the things that we give you.  Like, it's not what we want you to do. There's parameters in terms of how we want clients to be serviced and how we make them feel.  But how we actually do that is always up for iteration and improvement.

35:49 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, okay. As long as I can play around with the stuff, it's good. I never want to change something.  I just want to be noted that I'm able to make it look good.

36:00 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, like John was saying yesterday, understand why it's there. And then if you think it could be better, then suggest some changes to us.  We want you to improve it. We want this process to be better. We know it's not bulletproof, right? And even yesterday, Federico was saying like, I don't want to put my personal details.  I was like, you know what? There's social security numbers on that document. We shouldn't be putting that in the Slack channels.  So now we've updated a process, which is actually better for us because we needed them filling out that Google Doc first, right?  And then we pin that to the channel. And then we have that living there for them when they have to fill out their buyer profiles and stuff.  So something that just didn't make sense, we updated it. Now the process is better. Overall, we're net positive because we have them filling out the thing that they have not been filling out before.  They've just been filling out the live out doc, which then sucks for them when they have to go through this process again or fill it out or whatever, because they don't have one master doc that they're working off of.

37:00 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  So, yeah, definitely. Okay, that makes sense.

37:04 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Cool. Okay. Please with internal team members, disrupt deliverables and maintain alignment. It's a lot of jargon, but what does that mean to you?

37:15 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  It means, like, when there's an action item that I know Luke has to do, I have to get it over to him, and I have to make sure it gets done, follow up with it, get the answer, and report it back.  Like, make sure it aligns with what you were, what the action item was, or what your thought process was.

37:31 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Right. Or if there's a piece of tech that's broken, I need to go to Anka and get her to fix that, right?  Or the form is messed up. I need to figure out how I can update that, right? Even better if you have access to things, because another thing that I realized when Anka was away is she's the only one that knows how to do a lot of stuff.  And when we need to change something, you know, it's a problem. Like, that's an issue when you're a company where, like, only one person knows absolutely everything.

37:59 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  Yeah.

38:00 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay. This is a big one I'd like you to start doing. And I put it... Oh, I've started... Oh, I've talked through these things.  Okay. So the onboarding, I want this fully offered in the next two weeks. So by the 25th of July, to get the onboarding off of her.  Okay. Let's see if I put an E. Okay. The tracking and managing of all client-facing tasks. This is a system to be owned and managed by you, not the advisor.  The advisor is to advise, not project manage. Right?

38:45 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  Yeah.

38:47 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Ensuring you get what you need from all team members quickly to get clients' answers and results. So like making sure that the team's prioritizing getting you the answers you need or getting the clients the answers that they need.  um... Preparing agenda and materials. So this will be super helpful to make sure that we're staying on track with what the client's needs are, what the commitments are, what those actions items are, right?  So it's a kind of full circle process of what's happened with the client since the last call. What does the advisor, me in this instance, need to be aware of since the last time I spoke to them?  What is still outstanding in terms of the action items? What did the clients commit to and not do or do?  So I would make an update for the advisor or me by end of day before the next client call.  Because I keep walking into these things blind, you know, or on Buyer's Club. like, Luke, what's going on?

39:48 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  What's happened?

39:49 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So it would also be helpful for Buyer's Club when we have an advisor that you coordinate getting updates from you and the advisor from me.  Before I do Buyer's Club, so I understand what's happening with all the deals because what doesn't look good or doesn't give clients confidence is when I jump on and I have no idea what's happening with their deals.

40:11 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  Or I jump on and those are still pinned that we talked about weeks ago that are no longer active.  And I don't remember that because I have eight clients with umpteen million deals that I'm trying to keep track of while running the business, right?

40:26 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Right? So like just making sure that the advisor or me is fully prepared but also can hold the clients accountable to things that they committed to that they haven't done.  So what were the action items from that? What's the status of them? And also what's happened in their deal world?  Like they've gotten two new write-ups, they've done a broker call, da-da-da-da-da-da. Like what's a quick agenda? Um, so because the advisor is going to have 15 clients at once, right?

40:58 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  Yeah.

40:58 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So like doing something like... And doing it well can mean that that session with the client is that much more productive and meaningful and actually moving things along.  And we can hold them accountable on things, right? Or, hey, so-and-so sent their modeling in. That's what you're going to go through on the call.  Here's the link to that so you can review it before you get on rather than being blindsided. Here's the links to their write-ups for the active deal or the newest deal that came through so you can be prepared for it.  Clients said they want to go through financials. I asked them to post their model in the channel. Here it is, right?  So we're setting up the advisor for success on those calls. And success is moving the client forward. And what do they need to know or do or be prepared for in order to help that client move forward?

41:52 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, I understand. Is that like something? I don't know if you look at the comments in the Deal Team channel, the deals that are pinned?  I take the last deal, the action, not the action items, the status of all the deals, and then I put them in the comments for you.  But I realized the other day that you don't look at the open, you just look at each client.

42:13 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  No, so you need to pull this out specific to the client, right? So you might be tracking this stuff in different places, but it needs to be like, here's DL's agenda, here's DL's agenda, here's JG's agenda, right?

42:30 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  Yeah. How did the pinning deals go this week? Because in the beginning of the week, I went through all of the Fathom calls of the last two months, and I un-pinned and I went back to listen, like, we have to get this figured out.  Was there anything in the pins that were not supposed to be there?

42:47 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Not that I could pick up on, but I didn't have a lot of client calls, so I think they were pretty cleaned up.

42:55 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  Okay, great. I just had to clean them up in a hot spot as well, because there's so many deals back from...  Client's time that are still in the wrong stages that I just have to clear.

43:19 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay. I've got stuff in a couple different places right now, but I just wanted to make a note there.  Okay. So in the client agreement that they signed, they are supposed to be giving us a response within 24 hours.  If we post an NDA, if we post a write-up, if they're looped in with a broker. So what I want you to do is if Luke posts an NDA, it's been 24 hours, they haven't responded, chase him.  If he posts a write-up, they haven't responded, it's been 24 hours, chase them. If Luke makes a broker intro and they haven't updated us for follow  We need to chase them, right? If they schedule a broker call, what time is your broker call so we can follow up on it?  After the broker call, what was your update on what happened on the call? Please send us a voice note or a text to let us know what happened, right?  Because I don't want that client call to just be an update, right? And ideally, we can get the clients using Slack and more to do async updates.  Do you know what that means by async? It means to do things rather than having a meeting, to do things as and when you get to it, right?  So something that I also want you to do is pull that whole thing that I wrote Peter in terms of what the analyst does and add that to the process somewhere, right?  Because he didn't understand. Understand that Luke doesn't get on calls. So anytime that a client has an issue like that, and I want you to like scrutinize Peter's channel, because I  up with him a couple times, right?  Like, and this, and we're learning through this in terms of onboard clients, so they understand the process, right? Like, what do you get out of the analyst?  What do you get out of the advisor? What do you get out of me? Like, how does the team support you throughout this process?  Like, you need to drop your questions. And the write-up process will help, right? But he's like, it'll just be easier to get on a call.  like, we don't get them on the calls, but I never told them that. So it's better for us to teach these people these things early on.  So anytime you see an issue that I solve, grab that, figure out how we implant that as part of the onboarding process.

45:51 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  Definitely. It was nice, though. I really wanted to know how you're going to respond. All Thank He didn't look very happy about your response.  But I mean, it's nice getting him to understand the expectations. Otherwise, if you're going to say yes to a call or something, it's just going to keep happening.  And he's spinning his wheels, right?

46:16 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  He doesn't need a call. He needs to just take the next call. But he's like, Oh, well, I'm gonna have to like rethink my whole thing.  It's like, just send us a voice note with what you're thinking and what you want to talk on the call about, right?  Like, so he's getting in his head about it. That's not him being like, yeah, he wasn't happy. But also, this is going to be his challenge throughout this process is, you know, not being able to just think on his feet and just move forward.  You know, he wants to think, think, think, think, strategy, strategy, strategy.

46:54 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  Has Luke followed up with the talk track? No, I don't think so.

47:00 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay. Okay, so that's on you. Ask him, Luke, when are you going to be doing this?

47:04 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  Okay.

47:09 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So when the clients are waiting for answers or actions from anyone on the team, if it's been more than 24 hours, right, or like if Luke says it on it, just be like, hey, Luke, when are you planning on doing this?

47:21 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  Yes. Okay. Just a question. What is the talk track, Athena? I mean, I've been waiting for a year and I have no idea what that is.

47:31 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Well, this is something we need to define in the onboarding process, too, right? In the write-up process, do we call it a talk track, like getting the questions together?

47:42 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  I have no idea.

47:45 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Well, we need to check that because if we're using the phrase talk track and we haven't defined that in the process that they use it, then we need to define it.  So in the write-up process document, when they put together their questions for... The broker or owner call, that's their talk track.  It's their track of what they're going to talk about on the call.

48:07 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  Oh, okay.

48:09 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So if you don't understand it, they definitely don't understand it. So we need to make sure that that write-up process document says, we call this talk track, right?  A talk track is your preparation of your questions for the call.

48:27 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  Okay. Okay.

48:30 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So take that as an action item, too, and make sure we update that. Okay. So I'm going back to the description.  This is really important, right? I don't want you to just assume things are right. I don't want you to wait to be asked to do things.  I don't want you to see a problem and not think of how we can, and that it's not your place to suggest something better.  You're joking. is to be that magical being to the clients, right? And in order for it to be magic, things behind the scenes need to be cleaned up, fixed, et cetera.  And I am not in the day-to-day. So there's, you know, I won't necessarily spot it.

49:15 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  Yeah. Would that be for instance?

49:20 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Go ahead.

49:21 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  Would that be for instance seeing yesterday when the client said he doesn't want to upload his financials? That is a fact.  That is something that needed to be put back.

49:30 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Is that what you're meaning? Yeah. But like, what do you think the issue is? What do you think the solution is?  Right? Like, and I realized that one was more nuanced, but have a go. Like, this is how you learn.  Like, what do you think his issue is? And what are potential solutions for us to solve that?

49:50 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  Yeah. Yeah. Okay.

49:51 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  But yeah, not just assuming that Anka and I are going to get back to him, right? Like, you're owning the client relationship.  So it's like, I need to make sure somebody gets them an answer. What do I think the answer is here, you know, or who do I think the person is to solve this?

50:07 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  Okay.

50:08 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  And then also like, hey guys, other people are asking about, Michael also asked about a skier portal, right? So now two different clients have said this.  Why are they asking that?

50:22 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  Okay, I understand.

50:24 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Why do you think they were asking for that?

50:27 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  Because they don't want, because there's too many people on their Slack channels, too many people that can see information and they want it to be something that's a bit more secure.

50:37 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So it's something that we have to create from our side and create a template and a way to do that for if that happens, because the second client asked for that, we just know what to send.  Yeah, when more than one client says something, that's something that we should flag and talk about. Like, is this something that we need to pay attention to and create a solution for?

50:59 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  Yeah.

51:00 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  If it's a quick fix, that's one thing, if it's like a big structural change or whatever, but I want you to be the one, because you're going to be on those channels, so you're going to be able to see those patterns, right?

51:13 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  Yeah.

51:15 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  And then owning those playbooks and processes using the client feedback, right? Like continuously refining it, you've been really good at this, at your process on the deal team, so you're going to be a natural at this for this too.  And really what we want the playbook to be is like, okay, it's time for reporting, let me go into this, here's my checklist, I know what to do, so then you don't need to remember it off the top of your head, it's just like, this is what it is every week, I've checked off all the things, I've done the right things, and then when somebody else comes in to also support on this, we've got this like up to date and can just train them super quickly, like you did with the NDA process.  Okay. Okay. Okay. You So cross-functionally, so it's jargon, but it means across sales, across delivery, across operations, across finance, right?

52:15 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, I understand.

52:17 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So something I'm going to be asking Austin to do today is starting to do a client brief on what they were told to expect as far as their geography or their search or timings for them to see things.  Because Luke was upset that we're taking off clients in geographies without knowing what we were telling the clients in those geographies.

52:44 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  Oh, okay.

52:45 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So the information wasn't getting to the team. So we need to get Austin to communicate, right? And then we're having some, like, payment issues with Federico, and Austin was like, let me know if you need to help, right?  So during onboarding, they were like,

53:00 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  There times that you need to get Austin involved. Yeah.

53:04 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  During their process, there might be something wrong with the operations. You need to get Austin involved. Deal team, most of the time, is going to need to be something involved.  Maybe there's something with finance and somebody is like, can I change my credit card, please? So you'll need to, you know, we're training up many for a lot of the finance stuff.  Right now it's Anka, but, you know, as we grow, we'll have different departments of things. Like John was talking about the subdivision of stuff, right?

53:30 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  Yeah.

53:30 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So you just want to make sure that you're that kind of glue across the whole process. When a client has a question, you know who to go to to get that answer.

53:38 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  And you're documenting that so somebody else also knows that. Okay.

53:43 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Cool.

53:44 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  Okay.

53:45 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  And then gathering and relaying client feedback to improve service delivery outcomes while continuously capturing and updating changes to their goals, preferences, and deal criteria.

53:54 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  So we're going to have the matchmaker or the Oracle, whatever we end up calling it. I like the Oracle.

54:00 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So. Thank you. I do, too. Yeah, I think I should call it that. It's funny. So you're going to be updating the Oracle, but also you need to make sure the team's getting that information or if clients are not happy with the deal flow that they're getting or if they're not happy with the type of deals that they're getting.  You need to make sure the team know that, right? And you're relaying that information to them.

54:24 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  Okay.

54:26 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Questions on this?

54:27 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  No. Makes sense. Basically, just be the tunnel.

54:34 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Explain that analogy to me.

54:36 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  The tunnel. Like an ant has like this big house and there's like these major tunnels on the inside. All those tunnels are connected to someplace.  You just have to make sure all the tunnels are connected and there's no blockages and everything just gets to where it has to be.

54:52 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Right. But also to be the fairy godmother because plants. Even though we know what each person on the team does, they don't, right?  Like, they aren't going to remember all that. It can be overwhelming and frustrating to have a million different people to have to talk to about things.  So what we want you to be is, like, if you're ever not sure, you come to me, right? And I will make sure the right person gets an answer to you.  So you're their kind of, like, first stop for anything and everything Acquimatch.

55:28 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  Yeah. Okay.

55:30 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So the tunnel and the fairy godmother. You know, that concierge, the warmth, the clarity, the confidence, staying organized and composed, you know, being proactive, responsive, and tuned into the client experience.  You have a lot of this stuff. So one thing I wanted to... Check on was, how are the books coming along that we talked about?
  ACTION ITEM: Finish reading "Buy Then Build" by Jul 21
 - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/349563173?timestamp=3367.9999

56:06 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  Oh, good. Good. I really enjoyed that. And it actually works along with the Buyer's Club. So I actually enjoyed doing the Buyer's Club because they kind of work together.  So it's a good thing.

56:18 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So is By Then Build done? Are you done with that one?

56:22 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  No, I'm not done with that one.

56:24 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay, cool. I'm a really low reader.

56:27 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  A few chapters live. I think it's two or chapters left.

56:31 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay, when do you think you can finish that by?

56:34 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  I can probably finish it this weekend.

56:37 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay. I may give you a week, just in case.

56:43 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  Okay.
  ACTION ITEM: Get "Unreasonable Hospitality" from Anka, start reading
 - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/349563173?timestamp=3403.9999

56:45 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So, we'll say by the 21st.

56:48 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  The first.

56:49 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  That's a Monday. And then you can start Unreasonable Hospitality. Do you have that one? Did I give it to you?

56:57 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  No, you didn't give me that one.

56:59 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  No, you Okay, get from Anka, and then make sure in these training documents that you're linking to the books.

57:08 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  Okay.

57:12 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay, so I've started outlining some things that we need you to do, and then I'm going to just talk through those really quickly, because a lot of this stuff is Anka, so I want you to, in your next training, just say, Athena's asked me to get these things from you.  Like, when can we train on them? And then we're also going to go through client servicing extras. Okay. And you can probably pull this into your client coordinator doc.  So making lender intros and tracking referrals, that's really important, and I need you to take that off, Anka, because a lot of people are going into, there, Butterfly.  Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. LOIs. And this needs to be tracked because we can get a significant referral and the whole team benefits from this.  So it's really important that that's being owned by someone. And also when those people decide on a lender, when they decide on a term sheet, we need to follow up with that lender and say, what do you need from us to make sure that their payment goes towards equity injection and that we get the referral.  So like we lost out on referrals from two different people for Lindsay and Kevin, because we didn't follow up.  That's tens of thousands of dollars.

58:36 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  Yeah. Okay. I understand.

58:39 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So on like Chris's deal, for example, that'll be $50,000. So but Anka forgets about these things because she's doing like much bigger things.  So I need someone to own this because the whole team gets a bonus when we get these things and it's significant revenue for the business.

58:57 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  Yes. I just have a question. Some of these might be stupid because I've never heard about stuff like this.  Why do you guys get paid for that? What is your role in the part and why are you guys getting money for that?

59:12 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Because the bank is getting hundreds of thousands of dollars of interest from the clients that we refer to them.  So they pay us the referral fee.

59:21 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  Okay, so it's the bank that's paying you the referral fee. Okay, I'm on it now. Yep.

59:28 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Also the recommended providers. This is QV. This is insurance. This is legal. We need to make sure that we're keeping this up to date and making those intros and sharing those details when clients need it in the process.  So this is something that Anka can show you what she has so far. It probably needs to be updated.  And then I need to review it with you. Like I said, this is in no particular order. Client gifts.  I'll put this top because that needs to be done. We also send a gift at LOI. Jenny just signed an LOI.  We need to get her a gift together. And I prefer it to go out, like, literally the day that they sign it, right?  Because it takes a couple days to get to them. And if they fall out of LOI, and it's taken a couple weeks to get to them.

1:00:21 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  It looks weird when it lands.

1:00:23 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Right. So Jenny's LOI gift needs to go to her. We didn't send one to Chris because he's in Barcelona.  But if Justin signs one, we'll need to get one to him. We don't have all the materials. So all of that stuff needs to be ordered.  So I have it so I can send those out. You need to create the shipping labels. just have her train that process to you on Wednesday.  Tombstones. Did you get your tombstone we sent you?

1:00:52 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  No, I didn't. I followed up with Anka the other day, and I got a checking number and it got lost.  It's in it was in some warehouse. I'm reshipping. In fact, I had to find it because the post office in my town closed a year ago.  So it went to a warehouse. So I tracked it down last week and I tried to see if I can reroute it to me.

1:01:14 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay, good. This is less urgent, right? But you'll need to learn this when a client's close to closing.

1:01:22 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  We've got a whole new, you've seen the new ones, right?

1:01:26 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  You're being sent one of the original ones. But the new ones are really awesome. And that was something Maria did for us.  So I don't even know where we order from or anything. I'm also... Branded. That's something I would like us to look into.  So, you know... John was saying a CEO notebook. So I was thinking we could have a notebook printed with their new business logo and the name of their name and the date of their acquisition.  And so they have a CEO notebook that when they take over the business, they've got their tombstone and they've got their notebook.

1:02:19 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, that's nice.

1:02:22 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Get new client briefs from Austin to share with team. So I'm going to brief him on that today. Um, and managing the matchmaker.  We're going to call it the Oracle.

1:02:35 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  Yeah.

1:02:40 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Um, this will, this will be your job also once we get it set up with David.

1:02:45 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  Yeah.

1:02:46 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Um, in our service agreement, we commit to responding to clients within 48 business hours. So that's just something that bear in mind if, and also I want to make sure that we're upholding that even if it's a hold message, right?  But I would like you to, if you see that a client's gone two, three hours without a message, to send them a note and say like, hey, I followed up with a relevant team member, they'll get back to you soon, right?  But we've committed in our service agreements to respond to people within 48 hours. They have committed to responding within 24 hours on time-sensitive things like write-ups, NDAs, et cetera.  If they repeatedly take a very long time to get back to us, then we have the potential to cancel the contract with them.

1:03:36 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  So I want to know who are the worst offenders in terms of timeliness. Okay.

1:03:43 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Because I don't want to keep servicing someone for 14 months who's not doing what they need to do to keep a deal.

1:03:49 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  I understand. And is that why we stopped looking for deals for Chris because he stopped responding to deals?

1:03:57 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Well, that, and he's so all in on this.

1:04:00 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  deal that he's not looking at the other ones that we're putting in front of him.

1:04:04 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  But on all these new clients, they're signing an agreement that says they need to respond within 24 hours. So I want to keep track of the ones who are repeatedly missing that kind of deadline, because if it's like four or six months in, we lose money if we keep searching for somebody that's not doing the things that they need to do to get a deal done.

1:04:26 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  Okay, that makes sense.

1:04:29 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay, so in the future, not yet, because you don't quite have the bandwidth yet with supporting Ray, but I'm going to want you to attend those client meetings with me or the advisor, and then you'll be able to immediately action the tasks and the steps.  And then like, that was awesome having you on with Federico, because I was just like, oh, I can just tell Ida these things instead of hoping somebody watched the replay and pick and that Fathom picked up on the tasks or the action item from it, you know.  So like, you're actually in those calls and can make sure like, oh, that's something I need to do. Oh, that's some feedback I need to note down.  And then the client call summaries, like I feel like these need to be better. At the very least, we need to be tagging the clients on the action items that they're committing to, right?  I don't think any of them are using the Fathom recordings as the way that we're posting it right now.

1:05:23 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, definitely.

1:05:26 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  I I do have the action items.

1:05:29 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  Every time an officer reports, I do extract all the action items. So I have all their action items with me.  Maybe that's something I can just, you know, post with.

1:05:38 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  I just think we, I think we need to rethink the whole post in Slack. Because it's like, oh, here's your call.  And then nested in the comments, here's the transcripts, right? And it's a lot for somebody to read, as opposed to look what we do for Buyer's Club.  It's like, here's the top line things.

1:05:55 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  And here's the link to the call recording if you want to dive in deeper.

1:06:00 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Here's what you talked about today. Here's your action items. Here's what we're looking into. Here's a link if you want to review it any deeper.  Something like that, because they're not using it. They're not watching it. They're not remembering the tasks that are on their plate that they're supposed to be doing.

1:06:17 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  So I think we can improve on that.

1:06:21 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Um, pinning and unpinning deals same day or within 24 hours would be awesome. Um, and then the books that we talked about.  So, um, I'm only going to keep you a couple more minutes. It's just these things that I want to go through.  Um, so, oh, wait, no, we have till 12, don't we?

1:06:40 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  Yeah.

1:06:41 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Oh, I was thinking we were done at 1130. Okay. Let's take a five minute break. Cause I want to, um, go to the bathroom really quick and then we'll come back at like, uh, 45 past.

1:06:53 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  Okay.

1:06:54 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay, cool. I'll see you in a sec.

1:06:56 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  Okay.

1:11:00 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Thank you. Thank you.

1:12:00 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  you. Oh, don't have a problem with meetings running over. I have like one or two meetings a day. think you're the one that has a problem when meeting has runs over because it's going to go into another person's meeting.

1:12:12 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, and also I like to have time to make a coffee and go to the bathroom before the next meeting.  So if it runs over, I'm just sitting here like staring in an empty coffee cup.

1:12:22 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  It's sad. actually thought of you the other day, Athena, something that we introduced in South Africa is butternut coffee.  And I was wondering if that's something you guys do in America.

1:12:35 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  What is that?

1:12:37 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  Butternut, like pumpkin coffee. So it's coffee that's made from pumpkins.

1:12:46 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Or is it just pumpkin flavored?

1:12:49 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  No, it's actually like, I don't know if they put caffeine with it, but it's called pumpkin coffee. It's something that we introduced in South Africa.  And I thought it was, you know, maybe an American thing because I know I you guys have pumpkin spice coffees.

1:13:02 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, pumpkin spice is like usually October, November, December, like pumpkin spice everything. I don't like it. I don't like pumpkin spice.  It's not my jam. Pumpkin coffee, though, that sounds weird.

1:13:19 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  Yeah.

1:13:23 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay, this is just some client servicing extras, but I think you could probably incorporate this into your overall client coordinator playbook, so let me make sure I share this with you so you have it.  I'm going to drop it in the chat, so just grab it for me, okay?

1:13:48 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  Okay.

1:13:50 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  And actually, I'll just put it in the client. Okay. Okay, and then also we need to go over reporting.  Okay, so client servicing. So when clients say that they're working on financials or like the model, it's really helpful for me if I can get a look at it before that we have a meeting.  Okay, so if they're like, I'm working on the model, then you can be like, hey, can you share it here?  And this is going to train them to do the model, right? Like if you know the meeting is going to be about financials, it's like, hey, how are you getting along with doing the model before your meeting, right?  So it's basically like starting to train instead of like, have you done the model? It's like, hey, how are you getting along with doing the model before your meeting?  It's better if they've done the finances at certain points. So you'll start to learn when those. And if we're going to be going through the numbers on a call, we want to make sure that they share the model first.  Also, anytime they share documents, if you can just check this, like, as soon as you see that they shared something, because multiple times in the last couple weeks, I see that they've shared something, I need to review it, and then I put it on my list.  And at the time that I go to review it, I don't have edit access, I can't even view the document.  So if you can check that for me and just say, like, you know, I've notified Athena or I've notified the advisor, I noticed that we don't have view access of the document, please can you update that so I can let Athena know.  Also, when you use the financial model, we need to check that the model version number is the most recent, and then it's filled out properly when they send through a model.  Thank you. Thank you. I will do some more training with you on this, but ask Anka how to do this.  Okay.

1:16:20 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  Okay.

1:16:22 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So model number is like the version number because we have a lot of bugs with the template when we first introduced it.  So it's on like version 4.2 now, but some clients will make copies of like old ones that they've done.  So there's a way to be able to see, like you unhide a column in the document to see what version they're using so that we make sure that they're using the most recent one because some of the old ones have bugs.  So at various steps, you're going to want to send like the, we have so many. Resources on our dashboard, and I want to get better at how we're using them, when we're using them, when we're telling people what to use.  So like these things with, well, we have the write-up process document, but sending people a huge document, like they're not going to read it, right?  So sometimes you'll just need to take snippets out at like whatever point they are in the process, and it's like, read these documents, right?

1:17:28 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  Yeah.

1:17:29 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  And what would be even better is like, as we get these processes dialed in to make some of your magical videos, it's like, okay, it's time for your broker call.  Here's what you do. Like most people aren't going to read an enormous document that we're putting in front of them.  It's just overwhelming, you know?

1:17:45 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  Yeah.

1:17:46 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So I want you to be thinking about things like that. Like are there, just like you were like, oh my gosh, the NDA and the blah, blah, blah process would be so much better if we had a video.  It's like, I didn't even know we could make a video that easy. I've been thinking in my head, like I need to record a whole bunch of it.  Videos, but when do I have the time to do that right now? So, you know, if it can be improved with a little video, and then we actually drop that video in the channel, and it's like, here's the document for you to go through it in detail, but here's what you need to be aware of, right?  Amazing. If, I mean, if they're having a weekly call, then we probably won't need this. Also, we're going to try to buy weekly calls with Athena free LOI and weekly post LOI clients.  So we're doing this with Peter. Peter gets a call with me every other week rather than weekly. This is also because, like, when deal flows slow, it doesn't look great.  To host a call. But for the new advisor, I want it to be. Weekly.

1:19:01 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  Yes. Why do you do weekly meetings, Athena, and not bi-weekly for all clients?

1:19:08 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So when Brian was looking after the clients, was giving some clients weekly calls and some clients not. And I don't like that some clients are getting a better service than others.

1:19:22 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, I understand.

1:19:23 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So when I knew I needed to let him go, I knew that the clients were probably going to be upset about that because he's a likable guy, right?  And they developed relationships with him. So my mentor was like, you got to love on your clients. Just love, love, love on them.  I'm like, okay, they're going to be upset, but getting more Athena time is going to make them happy. So I just took it as a strategic decision to make sure that we didn't lose clients over, you know, the Ryan thing that I just.  Standardized how we treated them. Jenny even found out about it. She's like, wait, people are getting weekly calls?

1:20:07 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  And he wasn't setting up. He was only doing it with people that were asking for calls. So he was just servicing them in different ways.

1:20:15 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  And then the ones that weren't active weren't getting a whole lot of help and support, which sucks. So I was like,  it.  I'm just going to do weekly calls so that they're getting so much of my time. They feel like everything's in a good place.  They're getting what they signed up for, what they paid for, until they can figure out what to do next.

1:20:34 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  Yeah. Okay. That makes sense. That makes sense. That was a lot of picking up you had to do after that whole scenario.

1:20:41 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yep. I was not expecting that. But luckily, Austin took all of the sales off my plate. So I had the space.  mean, the space was supposed to be going to growing the business and focusing on all the other stuff that we're doing.  But I'm actually grateful because it just helped me. So You're welcome. Thanks, Bye. Um, understand what we needed to improve in our deal flow process, which is literally everything.  So, you know, like having that space and interaction with you guys and the clients and everything, it's like, actually, we're going to build something that's much more sustainable and scalable because I, I've had all this time being on the front lines again.  So I'm grateful we would have, if I wouldn't have made the decision to let him go, and we would have had him and still operated in the way we did, there's no way we could have scaled to service all these new clients that we're bringing in.

1:21:40 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  I have to say, Athena, when you guys did that, I thought, now you guys had a massive mistake. But you guys getting back into the kitchen and me actually having clarity on what I have to do, actually made my life this past month or two easier than it was before.  And I didn't realize it could get easier. And so that shift happened.

1:22:02 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, well, we need to make decisions that it feels like a  decision in the moment. And you guys don't have the full, I don't want you to have the full context of what's going on.  And you're on his email, so you have an idea of what's going on, right?

1:22:21 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, I saw that. I did lead on David's time, something like that. I'm like, oh, no, no, no. Oh, it's very sad.

1:22:31 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  But that, you know, like, so you have maybe a little bit better of an understanding why, like, what, if that's what you're seeing, like, imagine what else I was seeing and we were seeing, you know.

1:22:44 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  Is that something that your acumatch is afraid of? Because, I mean, I go to the staff, I didn't see that it looks like it's going to be competition.  Is it something that makes you afraid?

1:22:57 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  No, because he couldn't even figure out how to keep his... Fathom out of a Zoom meeting, so how the hell is he going to try to, he couldn't keep the deal team straight, he was giving clients different services, you guys were running around every day with priority client, and like you just said, your life was more difficult when he was managing you and the team, so good luck.  Like, this is so, so much work, and it is so hard to set up and scale a business like this, so I'm, if it were anyone else, maybe, but I'm not worried about him, I don't think he has what it takes to be able to run a business properly.

1:23:40 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, but it, I mean, it is a slap in the face, Athena, mean, you guys were very good to him, and seeing that was just, I didn't expect that, because I always thought the world of him, and when I saw that, I was like, I didn't need to see that.

1:23:56 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Well, you saw his true colors, which took me too long to... See, it's really disappointing. I let someone like that into my business, you know, and like he refused to sign a non-compete in the non-circumvention.  So, you know, I feel like his intentions all along were to do what he's doing.

1:24:18 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  I mean, I like the systems better, even though it's overwhelming and there's like a million things to do. And I have a thousand sticky notes around me.  At least there's structure and there's a goal. And when there's a goal, I know how to work towards something.  It's not just what do I do? What do I do? There's actually something to work towards.

1:24:38 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah. And everybody's clear on what we're trying to achieve, you know, and like what we're doing as a team.  And like we know there's a lot of work, but OK, this is our focus right now. We're putting this to one side.  We're going to bring this back and we'll focus on this.

1:24:54 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  It's like we have to clean this up piece by piece and we're building the plane while we're flying it.  that. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, exactly.

1:25:01 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  is always going to feel uncomfortable, you know? So, like, as long as we're scaling the way that we are, we're going to be building the plane while we're flying it, which is going to feel uncomfortable for a lot of people.  But for us, it's kind of fun, you know? Always going to be something new for us to go in and tinker and build and improve on and, you know, bring in more people that thrive under that kind of, like, pressure and ambiguity.

1:25:28 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, I think that is actually what happened is we lost touch of the vision, and you stepping back to the kitchen is just showing us the vision of the company.  And I think that's the most important thing in the hiring process. I mean, I don't know anything about hiring, but the only thing a person has to have in the hiring process is the same vision for this company.

1:25:48 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, well, you guys didn't lose it. You were being misled and misdirected. And I was getting undermined. All the time.

1:25:58 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  I didn't enjoy it. I didn't enjoy So I saw Athena, I was not very happy. When I saw that email, I was really disappointed at him.  Yeah.

1:26:12 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Sorry, you had to see that.

1:26:14 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  It's okay. I have to see that. Sometimes you have to see that because, I mean, after that happened, I still haven't messaged him, LinkedIn him.  I didn't do anything because I respected the boundaries that you guys have. But I was always wondering if it's okay, you know, what happened.  when I saw that, was like, you know what, you got to focus to the vision. Sometimes I have to see stuff to get some clarity.

1:26:37 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, you know, and like he's putting all of you guys at risk by doing something like that.

1:26:45 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, yeah, exactly. And we don't want that. just, this is the goal we have to do in this company.  And I think that's the reason why I love working here because I actually believe in the vision that you guys are doing.  Even though I don't. I understand everything. I do know that the heart and the belief behind it is what makes this company thrive.  And going in competition with that is just, in my eyes, just, it's not nice. It's very rude. It's not something.

1:27:15 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  It's just not respectful of your coworkers, you know, and like, he was very, I mean, he undermined me. I was, I was trying for months to try to get this structure in place that, that we are putting in place now.

1:27:34 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  You know, like, I shouldn't have to beg him to focus on off market.

1:27:39 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  I should, you know, like, that was just a part of our service. And I shouldn't have to hire people to make up for the things that he is unwilling to work on in himself, you know, like, disorganization, time management, communication, all of those things.  It was like, I kept hiring people to make up for the things that he was unwilling I'm willing to work on.  And then when I pointed it out to him, I was attacked for being a bad leader. Oh yeah, he totally attacked me, gaslit me.  It was bad. It was a rough...

1:28:17 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  It's weird because we don't see that. We only see the shining, the happy, always good, always compliments.

1:28:27 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  That was strategic. When I started performance managing him, he started overly complimenting you guys and getting you on side.

1:28:38 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  I didn't see that, Athena. When that happened, everyone was like, what did you do, Athena? Why? But nobody knew the backstory.  just had to retrust the process. And when I saw that email, I was like, okay, she knew before we knew.  There was a reason.

1:28:57 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  There was a lot. There was months and months of trying to work with... And yeah.

1:29:02 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  And did you recover after that?

1:29:04 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  I mean, Cole and I were, it was a rough patch for us because it was all I talked about.  It was all consuming. It was awful. It was personally horrible. And I, I worried if I was making the wrong decision and Anka did too, you know, and then we were talking about it the other day and it's like, how much better have things gotten, you know, since we made the decision, you know, how much more activity of the clients had, how much more movement have they had, you know, like what have we been able to achieve as a team as a result of that?  It's, you know, the month I was in the kitchen and Luke put out freaking 32 write-ups. Like I, so there's, but I care about people.  I was worried about what would happen and, you know, all of those sorts of things because I believed he was a good person, but there's personality types that make you think that, but they're all for themselves.  And he didn't want to do the work necessary to take this business to the next level and also had ulterior motives the whole time.

1:30:25 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  But you guys having to let him go, he didn't take you guys to court or make any hassles for you guys.  That's good.

1:30:33 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  No, because he was planning on stealing everything from us, clients and our business model.

1:30:44 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  And it makes you think, I mean, if we didn't see that, would he have taken, because we all love him so much, would he have taken the people that worked with you, with him?  Because everyone thought he was this amazing guy. I was worried about that.

1:31:02 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  I was worried about you guys wanting to go and work with him instead.

1:31:09 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  It's Fathom, Athena. We didn't see that. I luckily, you know, Anka talks to me and she doesn't share anything with the client.  She just tells me, Ida, you know, there's a bigger thought behind this. There's a process I trusted. I mean, we weren't happy, but we trust the process.  And I mean, work has gone up so much better now because there's clarity and growth. It didn't feel like there was growth back then.

1:31:35 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah. Well, and you saw what he was doing with Jason too. So like you saw a lot, right? And that was like after the fact of what you were seeing, but, you know, not recording client calls, not recording off-market calls, not following the process, not making the introductions when he needed to.  You know, he was, you Negotiating securities in other countries, which put our whole company at risk. Like we could have been shut down based on the activities he was doing.

1:32:09 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  No, it's not.

1:32:11 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, we're not brokers. We can't negotiate deals in certain states. And he was the one that brought that to my attention.  And then he's getting on the calls with Andrew and Chris negotiating in another country where we don't even know the laws.  Like he put the whole company at risk. He put you at risk. He put Luke at risk.

1:32:30 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  He put me at risk. My goodness.

1:32:34 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  And then got mad at me when I told him like not to do it. And then he started talking  to the clients about how I was, you know, making him like not do things.  And like he undermined Anka every time she tried to implement something that the three of us agreed. Like this wasn't just about him wanting to do the, you know, other things.  But like this, this is the person. And that he was. And then when we started calling him out on it, then he started buttering you guys up and telling you what great jobs you were doing and getting you to like love him.

1:33:08 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  It was strategic. Oh my goodness, Athena, we didn't see that. We really didn't see that.

1:33:15 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  We saw this great guy.

1:33:16 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  that.

1:33:16 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  , I let him in my business for a whole year, you know?

1:33:20 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  When did you guys start to see that? If I can ask, how long did it take you to make that decision?

1:33:26 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  To start seeing something's wrong? At a six-month review, I addressed a number of things with him and he didn't really hear me.  He didn't show up prepared to the review despite me giving the format a couple times and then took no action on any of the items that I addressed and kind of pushed it back that it was more my issue than his.

1:33:59 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  Oh my goodness. goodness. So yeah, and I let it carry on.

1:34:02 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So that's on me. I didn't think it would escalate to the issue, you know, the problems that it did.  But when he was on vacation, Anka and I both had an emotional breakdown, trying to look after his work and clean up all the  that he left for us.  I've never cried so hard in my life.

1:34:23 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  Oh my goodness, Athena. I knew it was hard because I knew the last wedding calls, he kept shutting Anka down.  And I messaged Anka, like, I'm not understanding what's happening. Why is he being so nice to me? And why are you getting all this?  Every time it's time to talk, it's not being talked about in the calls. Like, what is wrong? Something is weird.  But I didn't, still didn't pick it up because, you know, he was the one that gave my performance review at six months.  He was the one that did everything.

1:34:53 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So to me, yeah, and I was the one that told him to do that. We went through everything and agreed.  Like when he was in a dress with you, so I was very involved.

1:35:03 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  He wouldn't have come up with that on his own. Yeah, yeah, when I got the email, I was like, okay, well, this is definitely someone else.  I didn't know that, Athena, I didn't know you guys had to go through all that stuff, because we didn't see that.  We just saw this great guy, and when he left, I was actually scared that, you know, Luke's gonna go with him, or I was too.

1:35:25 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  I was really, well, David gave us his notice, you know. And was it because of that? Partly.

1:35:36 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  No.

1:35:37 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  But he's got this other company, so he's still gonna be, and David and I have a lot of FaceTime together, so actually, like, we didn't have a lot of time together before.  And he had this other project that was taking off, so, you know, that was, and this is between us, please, but yeah.  Like, he, um, he said that wasn't the main reason, but it. Thank You Influenced his decision to go in full-time into the side project that he'd been working on.

1:36:06 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  Oh, I'm sorry about that, Athena.

1:36:08 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  It's part of what happens. But I'm happy, right? And I love David. And the amount of support he's continued to give, we now get to help him start his business.  And we get to be the beneficiaries of that. Um, so he didn't do it because of that, but it was like, well, my side business is taking off.  I'm really excited about that. I didn't think it was going to take off. So I'm going to do that.  And also he was honest. He's like, I've, you know, developed a managerial relationship with him and now I don't have anyone to do, you know, so it was, he was honest.  So don't feel bad. David has done exceptionally more than I would have ever expected him to do, you know.  Yeah. Phasing out, going and starting his business, and now we're going to work on all these projects.

1:37:04 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  But still, he instilled doubt in us. I mean, when Ryan left, there was doubt. Everyone had doubt. I would say they don't, but everyone had doubt.  And then I told Anka, why would you guys do this? Because when the whole Andrew off-market thing happened, Ryan took the fall for me.  I mean, he took the fall for me. I in the meeting, he told you guys that, you know, he might be stuck in everything.

1:37:34 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  He did not take the fall.

1:37:36 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  Yeah.

1:37:37 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  No.

1:37:37 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  I figured that.

1:37:39 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  No, I took the fall. I, because Ryan didn't manage you properly, and he didn't manage the process properly. And if Ryan's making promises to the clients, it is his responsibility as the vetting director to make sure that that's done, not yours.  So.

1:38:00 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  I did wanted to ask you guys, did he threw me under the bus there, did he, did he, yeah, because I did thank him for taking, for taking the fall for me, and he actually said that, you know, it, it was good for him to take the fall for me, so I was under the impression, you know, he took the fall for me.

1:38:24 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  No, he didn't, I did, because it's my company, so it's my responsibility, so if something goes wrong in my business, it's my fault, ultimately, right, and I empowered somebody who was supposed to be managing a team, and as a leader, if someone on my team messes up, it's my fault, but what he did, when it happened, what he said, he, he, he blamed you, and I was like, absolutely, not, you made the promise to the client, it is your responsibility, and so I.  I decided to give Andrew a whole month of service back to make it right. So not only did I take the fall, but I, this is not your fault, Ida, absolutely not your fault, and it never has been, because it was Ryan's responsibility to make sure you were set up for a success, that you had the brief, that you knew the expectations of when you needed to get that done, and he needed to check up on you on it.  That's what a manager does. Ryan did not manage you guys at all. That's on him.

1:39:30 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  But I thanked him for taking the fall, and he acknowledged that that is what he did.

1:39:36 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yep, of course he did, because that's the type of person that he is.

1:39:40 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  And that's why I thought you guys let him go, because of that mistake.

1:39:46 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  No.

1:39:47 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  Oh my goodness, no. Yeah, I'm sorry you guys had to go through all of that. I did not know.  I actually thought that it was, you know, it was. That's a mistake I made and he took the fall for me.  I thought that he took the fall for me. And because of the massive mistake, I didn't even know you guys paid the client back.  I didn't know that. That's a lot of hurt that he did towards the company. I'm sorry you guys had to go through all of that.

1:40:16 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  That's just one aspect. There was many other things, right, which we talked about. The undermining, the disorganization, the servicing clients badly, the blaming me when we pointed out things that he needed to prove on, the undermining, not managing the team, not being.  I had to fight him on off-market  seven months before he even gave it any attention. then he just decided that he was going to do off-market only and do nothing else.  And then he started negotiating deals when that was not his job.

1:40:55 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  See, that's all of the stuff we don't know because we only saw. Nice smiles, and how nice he was towards us, and I think he knew that that time is coming, and then he wanted us to be probably mad at you guys, or after that doubt.

1:41:13 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yep.

1:41:16 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  My goodness.

1:41:18 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, after I had a serious performance review conversation on that team call was when he, like, decided to thank every single person on the team.  He's never done that before.

1:41:30 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, yeah, he's never done that before. It's strange, Athena, I actually, it's weird, because you think someone has your back, you think someone is fighting for you, and then suddenly it's just, they're actually, I thanked him for taking the fall for me, and he acknowledged that he did that, oh my goodness.  I'm sorry. It's okay, Athena, everyone's true colors eventually comes out. I, I, I do. I in this company and the values and the way it's structured.  And if someone doesn't align with that, I don't see why they are here. Then they should do their own thing and they should go because the people who are here want to be here.  They want to show up to work. They want to bring their base and they want to improve and grow.  And that is what we've actually been doing in these past two months. I didn't realize that the stuff you guys had to go through with him was that bad.

1:42:27 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Well, I need to be the bad guy. You know, as the founder, sometimes I need, you know, I knew all of you guys were unhappy with it, right?  And I would rather be the bad guy than give you all of the gory details as to why I made the decision I did.

1:42:47 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  I could have synced the company, Athena, if you took someone with him, that it would have been too much for you guys.

1:42:55 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  We would have figured it out. I mean, I started, it was just me, you know, it was me. For.  I did everything. So if I needed to do write-ups, I'll do write-ups. I can do every part of this business if I need to.  I don't want to, right? But that's what I'm willing to do. I was worried about Luke, but if Luke failed, it's like, okay, I'll do the write-ups and we'll figure it out.  Were you guys, in the moment, and what you've seen since with him trying to cut us out of a closing fee with Jason, him pitching our exact business model to other people.  When we gave him notice, we gave him an offer to sign a severance agreement, which would include a non-circumvention, and we'd pay him money to sign that because we didn't have you all under agreements, and he didn't sign it.  So at the time when we were making the decision, we didn't know that he would do the things that he did also.  So it just confirms I made the right decision. But at the time, I didn't want to give you guys all that information because I'm like, I felt bad about having to do it too.  I thought he was just a bit disorganized and that sort of thing. And then when I was in consultation with my mentors and my therapist and everyone else, they're like, no, he's a narcissist.  Like, this is bad.

1:44:32 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  Oh, my goodness, Athena. And when you guys had to let him go, did you have to do that on a call?

1:44:38 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Or could you just like send him an email? I did it on a call, but I read a very quick script.  And then I just said, thank you. I'm going to give us the time to process.

1:44:47 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  And we just ended the call. Oh, my goodness. Hats off for you on that. I would have cried.

1:44:54 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  I did. I cried a lot. It was horrible.

1:44:58 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  I'm sorry, you guys. That's a birthday. It

1:45:00 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Oh my goodness, Athena.

1:45:02 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, but you guys told me, because I was always wondering.

1:45:13 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, you know, it's like, how much do I protect somebody versus giving you guys all the information? And so, yeah, anyways, so now you know, it was, it was not, it was building up over months and then there was just things I couldn't, you know, it's like now I'm losing clients and giving clients money back because of a disorganization and your unwillingness to, to do what we need to do to grow to the next level.  And then on top of that, you're, you're putting the whole company at risk by doing things that could literally get a shutdown, like, and when I address.  It wasn't just like, you're gone. I did try to have multiple conversations with him to address these issues. And every single time he started attacking me and telling me, it was my fault, blah, blah, blah.  I won't give you all the specifics, but there was no accountability or responsibility taken at all, including what happened with you.

1:46:27 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, I really didn't expect that, Athena. To be honest, I think because you guys have this nice team meetings at the end of the week, and there's a very nice mojo that's happening in the business.  If it wasn't for that, then the doubts would have been something more. But now it was just doubts and everything was left there because everyone works nice.  Everyone loves their work. Everyone gets cheated nice. Everyone gets compensated so good. And so why would people want to go with him then?  So I think most of Most of the things, the recovery was based in the foundation that you guys lighted in the company.  And that's why people actually stayed and not go with him. Even though we were mad and we thought, poor guy, you know, he's so nice.  We didn't understand everything, but because of the foundation you guys built and the mojo that you guys have, I think that's why the doubts were just left, not gone into action because of the way the company runs.

1:47:32 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  I appreciate hearing that. And hopefully, you know, that any decision I make in the future is for the benefit of the business, right?  Which is everybody that works here. Because if I make a decision for one person that puts the rest of the team at risk or does a disservice to them, then I'm not actually looking out for the business.  And that's the hard decisions you have to make as a founder. Like, I need to make the decisions on behalf of business, not on individuals.

1:48:01 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, definitely. I mean, we don't always see that, but the way you guys are treating us lets us rest in your decisions.  I mean, if you guys were a mean boss and you guys didn't give us recognition or bonuses like the way you guys did, and just helping us, like everything we've built towards, we get benefits from and we experience that with you.  If that didn't happen, so many people would have gone. But now, even if there's doubt, at least there's nobody, it doesn't go into action because of the foundation you guys built in only a year and a half.

1:48:41 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Thank you. That's really nice to hear. More foundation to come. So, and obviously, I'm having to do a lot of work on myself, you know, as a leader and encountering these kinds of things.  And so, but yeah, please keep this between us. I don't want to, you know, I want to leave that alone, but I know it was something that was on your mind for a long time, and you care about people, so, yeah.

1:49:12 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  It's one of those few things in life where you just have to stand up every morning, like, don't judge all the people the same.  Even if someone that you liked so much and loved so much hurt you, just don't lose sight of the good in people just because someone did that to you.  So it's just another forgiveness process, and tomorrow we wake up with a smell again.

1:49:34 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Love it. Okay, so got a few more things to go through, and then I've got a whole afternoon of meetings, so.

1:49:45 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  Oh, my goodness.

1:49:46 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Oh, that's Anka. Here's mine. I forgot I'm screen sharing, but let's see. Yeah, this is me. Where were we at?  Yeah. There we go. Okay. Okay, this, this, your start, you learned this the other day with Polly, right? When Polly was like, here's all these things, and you're like, urgent, and Polly's having a broker call.  So it's really helpful, because clients don't necessarily know to be like, oh, you know, this isn't urgent, or this is when the time is, or whatever.  They're just like, I have a broker call tomorrow. It's like, okay, well, what time? Because chances are that me or the advisor is scheduled in lots of meetings, right?  So based on what the thing is, what they're asking for, and the timing around it, then we can make a determination of what the urgency is, and how we reallocate our time, if we reallocate it at all, if we have all that information.  So you did a really good job of going back to her asking, and she was like, no, I don't actually need it.  So it was just a Athena FYI, right? As opposed to, ah, I have a broker call tomorrow, I don't know what to ask.

1:51:00 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  If it's like, oh, okay, well, Luke, hey, can you help with that, right?

1:51:03 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Like, that doesn't necessarily need to be a me thing.

1:51:06 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  Or owner says that they want to cancel the LOI.

1:51:10 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  It's like, oh, , that is, like, an emergency, right? So you'll start learning the nuance of, like, what's super important.  But when they ask something about a deal and, like, it's time sensitive, like, there's a call coming up or an LOI deadline or something like that.  Then you want to get clarification so you can give me or the advisor the details, right? Like, hey, it's Wednesday.  There's an LOI deadline. On Friday, client's asking this, right? So you can, like, if the client's like, I'm trying to meet the LOI deadline, be like, let me get an advisor on it.  When is the deadline, right? Or I don't know what I'm doing for the broker call. Let's get just sorted.  What time is the broker call, right? So just getting those, like, key details. So that, you know, if I'm on a Monday, like, all day, you know, brain sesh, and they have, like, an emergency broker call the next morning, then it's like, okay, I do need to reshuffle things.  If they have a broker call on Wednesday, then I'll be like, I'll do this Tuesday morning, you know? So it just helps me or the advisor to be able to make a call on actually how urgent is it and what do I need to do.

1:52:24 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, okay.

1:52:26 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Does that help you?

1:52:27 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  sense. Definitely, definitely.

1:52:30 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Cool. And I said this, if it's been more than two or three hours, let them know you've flagged with the team and we'll get back to them.

1:52:37 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  You're already kind of doing that. Yeah.

1:52:40 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  If they give feedback that may alter their deal box, I want you to write some copy that, like, confirms that, like, if they're like, I don't like pet services, you know?  And it's like, okay, can I confirm if that, like, are you wanting us to eliminate all pet care services?  Going forward. And then if they're like, yes, then say, okay, you know, so we need to write some copy that says, you know, there can be a delay in the results because we work back, you know, so the team will have to do some steps to update your deal box to put new deals in, which could impact your overall deal flow, like, hey, it's going to delay, you know, it could potentially delay future deals, and it could make you have less deals, depending on what they're saying.  So if they're like, I only want to go 15 minutes from my house, be like, okay, do you realize that is going to significantly impact your deal flow, right?  So we just need to get their confirmation that do you want to change? Yes. Do you understand that this is the impact of that change?  Yes. But we need to write some copy that helps do that, right? Rather than just being like, okay, I'll update your deal box.  It's like, no, they need to understand the ramifications of that.

1:53:56 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  Yeah.

1:53:57 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Because if they tighten their geography or if they remove The whole section of industry, A, you know, we need to look at what's in the pipeline.  And if there's those kind of deals, be like, can see the team was working on some, and this is what's so genius about you working the whole pipeline, whereas you could actually do something like that and be like, okay, I see the team's actually working on quite a few deals in this category or in this geography.  So when I make this change, that's going to reset the process, and it could be a delay before you see your next deal.  And overall, or if they're like, I want to tighten my geography, be like, okay, we can do that. However, it might be a delay when you see your next deal, and it could significantly reduce your deal flow overall.

1:54:42 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  Are you okay with that? You know? Yeah, okay. So you want them to understand what the ramifications of their ask is going to be.  Yeah, otherwise, it's just changing every week. They need to understand the process, okay?

1:55:00 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  And then we're going to do try for new clients, the bi-weekly calls with me, pre-LOI, and then weekly post-LOI for new clients.

1:55:07 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  We set these up when they get their first write-up.

  So like we've got four new clients starting in August. I can't do 11 clients a week if we don't have an advisor hired.  Oh my goodness, that's... And Steve and Pauli always go overtime, so it's going to be longer than 11 hours.  I could manage that better. And it's going to help me a lot more if I have that agenda going into the call.  And if you do it, like I want to do it a few times just us, but I think it'll even be better to share the agenda in their channel before the call.  So it's like, okay, let's go through boom, boom, boom, active deals. Let's go through this, like outstanding steps. Let's go through this, like, you know, here's what we did.  So if we have that, you see how... It's working for our meetings to have an agenda, like how quickly we got through .  So same thing with the client meetings. So I reckon we'll be able to reduce those down to 30 minutes, right?  But I use it as a teaching point too. So usually I'm trying to teach or I'm just trying to butter them up and make sure that they love me because our deal close really slow.  Like, you know, so just like, I'm just loving on them while we're figuring some stuff out. We also don't have off market turned on right now.  Like it's, it's not, we're not doing as well as we should be for sure. And we've got a whole bunch of new clients starting in August.

1:56:37 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  So definitely a lot of work to do.

1:56:42 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Lots of work to do. So we're going to try biweekly with the new clients, right? And as long as we're doing these other supports, like, okay, it's time to sign your first NDA.  It's time to sign your first buyer profile. Like those are calls that you can do. It doesn't need to be with me.

1:56:59 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  It Right?

1:57:01 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  And then, like, here's the components that are going to be in your first, and then the first write-up call can be with me.  It's like, here's the components in your write-up, and then we're going to schedule a follow-up call 48 hours from now to go through your feedback on that call.  So we need to start implementing all of these processes that we're putting together. So I also want you to scan the, I know, I don't know if Anka's told me whether it's ready or not.  I know you guys were working on that. But once I approve that document, we introduce it to clients, and you're going to have to extract all the things on your plate from that, too.
  ACTION ITEM: Create plan of all tasks, info needs, training needs; propose timeline to Athena/Anka
 - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/349563173?timestamp=7052.9999  So, you know, there's a lot here. I don't, you don't need to do it all at once. What we need is maybe a plan of, here's all the things that I need to do, here's all the things I need to get information on, here's all the things that I need to get training on, so we can have an overview, we can pick which things we prioritize, right?

1:57:57 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, exactly.

1:57:59 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  How does that help?

1:58:01 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  Very good. Is that something you guys need done by today, or is it something that I can extract and bring it to you guys next week and say, this is what has to be done, this is what is needed?

1:58:12 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, do it. Why don't you look at your schedule and all the things that you have on your plate and let us know when you think you can do it.

1:58:21 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  The sooner the better, like I said, Anika's the bottleneck.

1:58:24 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  I'm about to be another bottleneck when we start bringing on all these new clients. And I kind of need my time freed up to do interviews too, because our biggest constraint right now is having the time to get through enough interviews to find good people.  And I'm not sure we found our advisor in this first round. We thought we were going to have someone hired, but we have one more presentation on Monday.  Unless he absolutely blows it out of the water, we're going to have to start the whole process again for the advisor.

1:58:55 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  Yeah.

1:58:55 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So the more that you can, the quicker that you can free up me and Anika's time, the quicker. Or the more time we'll have to hire the people we need to sort this out.  understand. Yeah. So, but I don't want it at the expense of the day-to-day still being done, right? We still need to service our existing clients.  So that's why I don't know what your workload is with Ray and all the things. So you look at it, you let us know what you think is a reasonable timeframe to get us an overall plan of what you need.  Anka is going to start training you on little bits here and there. I'm going to try to put more training time in on the things that I need to train you on.  The onboarding process, that needs to be updated. And then I need to review it all and go through like the context bits if I need to.  Like, for example, in the onboarding, there's a message to the client. It's like, now it's time to start Buyer's Club, right?  And it's like, what even is Buyer's Club?

1:59:58 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  Yeah. They don't know what Buyer's Club is.

2:00:00 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  We're assuming that they know what it is, right?

2:00:02 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  So there's all these things in there.

2:00:04 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  It's like process, process, process, but it's like, why, why, why? So I need you guys to like, make sure you're answering the why in all of these processes also.

2:00:14 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  Yeah. Okay. Definitely. That makes sense.

2:00:19 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay. Cool. Let's see. So there was something else in here where, what am I looking for? What was the one that you put together?

2:00:33 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  Client service. Okay.

2:00:36 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  We can come back to this. I think it's kind of straightforward, but I like numbers and who did what and like added to your, like, so we can do this later, but this is something that I'm going to start wanting.  Like what's the deal team numbers, the overall numbers by week. numbers, numbers, the the the the numbers So you'll need to make sure that the team's actually filling out their numbers.

2:01:04 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  Yeah.

2:01:06 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  And then what client actions were taken, what client support was given, what onboarding happened. And this is something that will be posted publicly.  What were all the Primus client actions and what is the status and update? And then monthly, I want us to start doing monthly reporting.  Anka used to do this, but again, doesn't need to be her, right? It's better for you to do this so you see what's happening, right?  Okay, I'm going to leave it there. We've been at it for two hours, so that's a lot.

2:01:41 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  How are you feeling? Good, excited. Now there's a lot of work. I just have to brainstorm it, go through it, and figure it out.  I do have two questions, though.

2:01:51 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, of course.

2:01:52 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  Yeah. One, because this week was new for me, I did not know what I'm allowed and not allowed. So this just backtrack to me.  When you talked about the talk track, is that something Peter said?

2:02:03 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Because that wasn't in the action items that I pulled from the calls. No, you're also going to have to pull action items from the channels too.

2:02:12 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  Oh, okay. Great. And make sure it happens.

2:02:15 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay. Right. So if you look at the deal team channel, I said, hey, Luke, Peter's struggling here. I think we need to do a talk track.  And he said, I'm on it. So then you can follow up and be like, hey, Luke, when do you think you'll be able to do that by?

2:02:32 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  And that's not an active deal, right?

2:02:34 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  And it's like two weeks after and Peter's like, oh, like he's freaking out. So it's like, let's just get him the talk track and be like, okay.  So, but Luke's doing all the vetting and that sort of thing.

2:02:47 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  So like. He needs to be reminded of that.

2:02:51 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Right. But also when are you planning on doing this? Right. Because he might have a different timeline in his head.

2:02:55 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  Like I was thinking it would be within 24 hours. It's been two days now. Exactly. So that is something like, hey, Luke, are you on it?  We would like to get this to the client at least in 24 hours time. you get that back to him?  Kind of thing?

2:03:10 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah. In this instance, like, Luke, when are you planning on working on this? And if he's like, oh, next week sometime, be like, actually, we need to get this over to him sooner.

2:03:18 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  Like, when can you do it? Okay. Yeah.

2:03:21 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Right. But in certain instances where we have a commitment to clients in certain amounts of time, you need to make sure that the team's doing that.

2:03:28 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  Yeah. Get notified if they need a response between that time.

2:03:33 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah.

2:03:34 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  Okay. The other thing I wanted to ask you is, when does this actually start? Because this week, I wasn't sure when I was allowed, when I wasn't allowed.  Is this something that I can just jump on and start doing?

2:03:48 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Please.

2:03:49 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  Okay. Because I didn't exactly know when, when not. I just wanted to know if there's like a kickoff date.  Right.

2:03:55 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Well, I mean, kind of unofficially kicked you off. What, what. What we need to do is we need to hire another deal flow coordinator, right, to get you fully extracted from that process.  And you'll need to train that other person, too, and make sure that Ray and this other person are, like, doing well.  So I imagine you'll still need to touch in occasionally, but we can't fully extract you from deal flow right now.  So that's what our plan is in the next couple weeks, hire another deal flow coordinator so that you're fully on this.  But as far as I'm concerned, I want you to do what you can. What you need to be good about telling us is what your bandwidth is, right, like, and how much is too much while making sure that the deal flow is still being looked after.  And, like, not, like, that it's not slowing down because you're doing more stuff on client stuff.
  ACTION ITEM: Brainstorm title ideas for new role, submit to Athena
 - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/349563173?timestamp=7490.9999

2:04:55 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  Yeah. Yeah. Because that's the origin of everything is the deal team.

2:05:01 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So if you want to think about a title, too, I don't think we should use coordinator because people were already getting confused between, and you were getting, you know, we were getting confused.  So we need deal flow coordinator. So if you want to think of, you know, some title ideas for who this fairy godmother is, and run them past me, then let's do that, too.

2:05:27 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, I can do that. Okay, I just wanted to know exactly when does it start becoming my responsibility, because I want to take action on stuff.

2:05:35 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Take action, please. Yeah, like I said, like, do it. Take action.

2:05:39 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  This is your role.

2:05:41 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  You're just doing it part-time until we can do it full-time for you.

2:05:46 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, I must say, Athena, I'm really happy you guys got Ray, because right now, the only thing I'm still doing in the deal team is helping her sign the NDAs.  She's taken over everything. So that actually... Freed up my time so much, because this week there was so much stuff that Anka gave me that I had to work through, and I could not even focus.

2:06:06 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So I'm only like 10% in the deal team now. Oh, that's amazing. Okay, great. So yeah, like, we're going to be building this process, this role with you.  And then once you're flying on that, you're not necessarily going to be building new processes and stuff, you'll just be fully on supporting the clients.  And hopefully we can get all that in a good place by the time all these new clients start in August.  You know, I want you to be taking over the onboarding process, too, because we have four in August, we have another three in September.

2:06:39 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, definitely. Excited.

2:06:42 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Me too. Thanks for being up for this. It's a huge help. And, you know, just like I said, don't don't tell us when you're drowning, like, tell us before you start drowning.  And I know that's really hard for you, Anka, but... We need to be able to troubleshoot.

2:07:04 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  It's hard, Athena, because I see when you're on Slack, I know you're not working eight hours a day. So how can we tell you, we don't want to, it's too much for us when we know you're working like every hour of the day.  It's literally our job to support you in that.

2:07:22 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  But it's my business, right? Like I get, I get the benefit of the overall, like I am the one that gets the money when I sell the business.  So I should work longer and harder than all of you guys.

2:07:37 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  No, please don't sell the business.

2:07:40 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Oh, no. I mean, at some time I'm going to retire, right? Or like something like there's, there's a point in every business owner's life when they're not doing it.  But no, so that all of the investment of time that I make into the business, it's like I benefit from down the line, right?  Yeah. So the founder should work longer and harder than anyone on the team. That's my view anyway. I, you know, because I'm like, it's my company.  Like, I benefit from that. So, and I want, you know, I want you guys to have lives and take care of yourself.  And so I love that you all work hard, but I want you also to have your weekends and, you know, like, go on vacations.

2:08:31 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, I know. I know. It's just, we know there's a lot of work that needs to be done. And I mean, we're young, we can work a lot.  So, and we enjoy it. That's the problem. I mean, if didn't enjoy it, I was like, let's not do this.  But because we believe in what you do, it's, it makes it not feel like work, but just enjoy every step of it.

2:08:51 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  I love it. I love that. We have a good team. And we're going to keep bringing in more awesome people like that.

2:08:57 - Ida Badenhorst (Unrestricted)
  Yes, definitely.

2:09:00 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Amazing. Well, thank you so much, Ida. I'll see you in a couple hours. Yes, thank you. Thank you for the training.  Have a good day. course. Okay, you too. Bye. Bye.
