# AcquiMatch Buyers Club 04/02/2025

[00:00:00] 

**Athena:** Hello. Hello. Hey, Gil. Hey, Jason. Yay. Jason's here. This is going to be so relevant for you right now. Amazing. Uh, Andrew's here too. Yay. We've got the crew. Justin, hey, welcome. First time. Justin's new. He'll be starting his search soon. Steven Polly in Atlanta. How you doing? Cool. Nice, nice crew today. So this is going to be an amazing conversation and it's so relevant for all of you and it was so, so impressive to Work with Lindsay and come in and kind of watch how they navigated the SBA space.

So, um, Kevin is here. Lindsay's not feeling well, but they did this together and they had some amazing insights of buying not 1, but 2 businesses that we found them last year. And not only did they do that, but they worked with both an SBA broker and direct with a lender. So they have two different loans with [00:01:00] two different institutions.

And on the first business, they had issues that like, you know, lenders kept looking at it and saying, no, but we knew that there was a way to get it done. So they went to seven different lenders through their process. To be able to get things over the line, um, and they documented and really thought about every point and all of the learnings that they took from that.

So what they're going to do today is walk you through their top tips, their top learnings and also talk you through what the process actually looks like when you go through the SBA process. And obviously. Every not obviously, but actually every lender is completely different, too. So we're going to talk through some of the nuances and stuff.

So Kevin's going to do a presentation. Then, as usual, after that, we will open it up for discussion and questions if you want to dive in, but I think it's so useful to hear from somebody who's only a few months ahead of where a lot of you are [00:02:00] at. So, um, they closed on. Uh, business number two, just literally at the end of the year, January 30th, uh, and the first one before that was in October.

So super excited for Kevin to share these insights. They're amazing. They're gold. I got a preview of them. So, uh, definitely take notes and, and start thinking about the questions that you want to ask because even everything they're covering here today, right? Lindsay and Kevin are just an amazing resource for how to navigate this process and the way that they did it was exemplary because it shows resilience and you're going to get told no a million times you're going to get challenged so many times throughout this process and it's never done and you know like there's always a way to bob and weave and find another way so they really did that so Kevin thank you so much for being here over to you.

**Kevin:** Um, well, hey, guys. It's uh, it's nice to see you all. See all of you. I think I've joined one other [00:03:00] time. And so I do recognize a few of you. Um, I'm going to see if I can change my screen here or share my screen here and yeah, we'll go from there. Okay,

cool. Are you guys able to see? 

**Athena:** Looks beautiful. 

**Kevin:** All right. I love it. Um, cool. So, cool. Yeah, we'll just kind of jump right in. Um, fortunately, Lindsay wasn't able to join us here. She, uh, she definitely is a little bit better with the, uh, the presentations and and and putting these slides together, but it was pretty fun going back over some of the details from the experience.

While we were preparing for this. So, yeah, let me know if you guys have any questions as we go through. [00:04:00] So, to Athena's point, you know, we closed on 2 businesses last year. The 1st one we closed was October 4th. The 2nd was December 30th. Uh, we spoke to a ton of different lenders over the course of what feels like, I don't know, 6 months, 7 months when, from the time that we started really getting serious, um, in, in that, that whole process.

The 1st deal that we closed, we actually worked with an SBA lending broker. Um, the, the 2nd deal that we did, we went direct. We just, we just did it direct with the lender. So, we got a little bit of experience both ways. We'll talk about some of the differences. Um, some of the pros, some of the cons just to kick things off.

I think, you know, maybe some of these tips will be a little, um, intuitive, but I think they're worth saying, start working with, start, start trying to find your lender as soon as you get your signed LOI. Um, [00:05:00] it's kind of a, a little bit of a dance when you're getting close to signing your LOI, whether it's.

Going to be worth speaking to, to a lender ahead of time. I think a lot of times, you know, a good lender might not really want to give you much time of day if you don't have a deal structure in hand that you're able to talk through with them. But in terms of like making sure that you're getting enough conversations going because you don't know which lender you're going to go with, I think generally, if you're if you're doing this direct, you're not working with the lending broker, I would say, you know, start trying to have 2 to 3 conversations with with different banks.

So you can start to see, you know, which bank is going to be a good fit for you as much as they're trying to see which, you know, if you're a good fit for them. If you're working with a lending broker, like the one that we did at Pioneer Capital, um, at least. The guy that we worked with in particular, which I, I don't know if, if Athena has, has introduced you guys to them as [00:06:00] we met him through Athena.

He was pretty adamant that we want to work with 1 bank at a time and it's, it's entirely to protect relationships. Something that we started to learn the more that we went through the process is that certain lenders, they get, they get a little spooked if they think that you're shopping around. So, you know, definitely don't.

Lie to anybody that you're speaking with. I mean, I think it's, it's good to be transparent as much as you're able to, but just know that if, if it's really clear that you're shopping heavily for the best rate, you might start running into some issues, getting, getting people to really engage with you fully.

And then I think just maintaining a regular cadence with, with your lender. And again, this is, this is probably pretty straightforward stuff, but it's managing expectations, right? They've got a ton on their plate. And if they can understand that you're, you know, they, they know what to expect from you in terms of like, how, how often are you [00:07:00] reaching out to them?

Are you going to follow through with the thing that you said you're going to follow through with goes so far and making sure that you have a good working relationship with them. And at the end of the day, I think that's, that's really what it comes down to is. You need to find somebody that you can work together with to get a deal over the line.

Building rapport with your lender, I think is, is absolutely huge, right? So it feels at times like they're just poking holes in your deal. It's really important that you look at those, what, what's perceived by the lender as an obstacle, as an opportunity. They're trying to de risk your deal. If you take what they're, you know, the concerns that they're bringing to you and either make sure that you're, you're kind of building in some D risk into the structure of your deal.

Like, that that's a great opportunity to make sure that you're protecting yourself, right? Because the [00:08:00] lender wants to make sure that the deal is going to be sound. So, do you so, if you're, if you're thinking about it as putting yourself on the same side of the table as the lender, then usually there's a way to find a solution to the concern that they're bringing to you.

But it's really important. You're getting to the root of those concerns because sometimes it might sound. On the surface level, like, the concern is about, I don't know, the amount of seller note that you have, but really they're trying to de risk the client concentration. And so if you can get creative with, with, you know, understanding what it is that's, that's presenting the obstacle for the credit review team, and then coming up with a creative solution, a lot of times you're able to work with them to find a solution That you might need to go back to your sellers and, and, and build into that deal, but really it is about having that relationship with the lender and then getting creative on, on, you know, getting over the, all those, those obstacles,[00:09:00] 

and I think it's important that you're exuding confidence. Again, probably pretty straightforward, maybe a little intuitive. The lender needs to know that you're confident in your ability to run this business. And it is going to feel like you're interviewing for your future company. We went back and forth between calling this an interview and an interrogation because certain lenders, it really does feel like that, right?

Like they're They're, they're really putting you through the paces to make sure that before they go to bat for this deal with their credit review team that they have the right buyer in position for it. So, if you're not able to answer, you know, some of these, these questions about what does the company do?

Who are its clients? You know, what's a small client? What's a big client? Things about customer concentration, but maybe more importantly, like, why are you a good fit? [00:10:00] What about your experience? Are you going to be able to bring to this company? Um, you know, these are these are major, major check marks that the lenders are going to want to get out of the get out of the way pretty early before you even start doing any of the paperwork.

Also, you know, and again, I, I think the benefit that we had is that we, we spoke with a ton of lenders. And so every time we had a conversation with a lender, we started to realize that they're asking a lot of the same questions. And so we started putting together a little bit of a story to answer these questions and to get in front of them.

But know where the downsides are in the financials of your company, because you're going to want to be able to understand any, any changes in revenue, any changes in your cogs. Why did your gross margin all of a sudden go up? It's not just the downside things that you have to be able to answer. It's like, why did things change for the better?[00:11:00] 

Because they want to make sure that the seller of the business isn't tweaking things on the surface level to make the books look better than they actually are. They wanted to make sure that it's a, it's a repeatable performance and then, yeah, I think just drawing from our experience, something that worked really well is that we had this kind of Q and a doc where we were, we were putting some of those questions that we were getting, you know, over and over again, every time that we had a conversation with a lender.

You know, the perception from the lender was, wow, these guys are really put together because we were answering questions before, before they had a chance to. And I think it's, it's always going to be better that you control the narrative in any risk areas than letting the lender fill in the gaps and come up with their own story.

So, if you, if you can get ahead of those things. It's going to, it's going to serve you well.[00:12:00] 

So when you're choosing a lender, because as much as they're, you know, deciding if you're the right fit for this business, you really do need to make sure that the lender that you're choosing. Is a good fit for you because not all lenders are created equal. So make sure that, you know, not only the deal team that you're working with your attorney, Athena's team, your CPA or your quality of earnings provider that they have experience closing deals and that they've got experience in the industry that you're working in.

You should really make sure that the same applies to the lender that you're choosing as well. Right. So if you've never heard of a bank, but you're interested in them, go check out how many deals they've done. How many did they do last year? What was the average size of the deal that they did? How many dollars did they lend in SBA dollars?

Right? Because the last thing you want to do is like, get really far down the road with a lender who's closed 2 deals. [00:13:00] In the last 2 years and none of them for as much as your as your deal is worth and then it start to derail things because your lenders are your your sellers starting to get anxious and things aren't moving along.

So, just make sure that the bank's going to be able to get the job done as well.

Here's some things that. Yeah, we recommend asking the lender. Um, it's an interview both ways, right? So, like, what's their deal box? Certain lenders are going to want to lend on certain types of deals. One of the mistakes that we made early on is we went pretty far down. The path with a lender who she was great, she helped us with the deal structuring for the 1st deal.

We were never going to get through underwriting with them because the business was completely outside of the deal box and we wasted about 2. 5 [00:14:00] months working with this lender before we were before we realized that we had to move on. Um, so that was that was 1 of the really big, like, moments that we had.

In our, in our 1st deal process, you know, do they do deals in this type of type of industry? Um, were they favorable experiences? You know, sometimes we'd be talking to a lender and they had done deals, you know, so the 1st business that we closed was an ad agency. And so a lot of banks aren't going to want to touch that.

There's a lot of unique things that are risky about those types of businesses. And certain banks were like, yeah, we'll do it. Okay. But that lender had gotten burned by their underwriting team in the past. So they were super, super cautious about moving forward. So those are the types of things that you might want to get out of the way early on and just understand what their appetite for your type of business, for the size of your deal and making sure that that aligns with the bank.

Not every business is [00:15:00] going to need a lot of credit, but if you are going to need a lot in credit, you should be having the conversation early. Because if you don't talk about it early enough, you might find yourself where they've submitted a packet to their review team that doesn't include one, and that just causes delays.

It's not that you can't undo those things, it just causes delays. And then what type of specific term offerings are they able to provide? These are just a couple that we saw. I don't know if there's a bunch of other like, you know, unique deal terms that that banks are willing to offer. But on the 1st deal, we were able to get a 3 year fixed interest rate and then it goes to variable after that.

The 2nd deal, you know, it was, it was variable the whole way through. So just understanding if there's any flexibility there. That you guys might be able to get, but a lot of that's going to be based off the deal itself. So, and then ask them to go over their full lending process with you because every bank's process is different.

It sounds [00:16:00] very similar. It's it's honestly, it's it's. It feels like you're getting into the weeds, but I think it's really important that you, you know, take notes, understand what the process is going to be from start to finish so that you can help manage expectations with the seller and with the sellers broker, because that's really what the job becomes is is you're managing expectations on both sides and trying to march a deal towards close.

So the lending process. This is different for every bank. It was different from the two deals that we had. Um, we started to try to put them side by side and realize that maybe this is something that we can just pull out and, and do a follow up with Athena offline to try to like put in a timeline to help you guys see.

So I think there were a few things that we took away. The first is we moved much, much faster on the second deal than we did [00:17:00] the first deal. Because we learned a lot about that front end of the lending process, but then the order that the banks do things and some of the specific things that a bank will ask for, um, can just very so.

The things that felt pretty, pretty common throughout. So the pre screen, that's where they're asking you, like, why you, what do you have to bring to this business? Tell me about the business. They're trying to call out anything that jumps out at them from, like, just an initial glance at some financial statements.

Um, they're going to ask you about the deal structure. Why the terms are set up the way that they are things like that, and then there's a lot of paperwork after that. Right? So that's where you're, you're collecting everything that you're going to be collecting for due diligence. Plus, you're going to be filling out personal financial statements and personal information forms and all sorts of those things.

The personal financial statements were a particular bane of our existence. I think, um, [00:18:00] every bank's personal financial statement was in a different format, so you couldn't even copy it. Okay. But one thing that we did find to be helpful after we did maybe like 10 of them is keep your own list of assets and liabilities and update that list first as things change, you know, we, we were doing these PFS statements over a six month period.

And so like any big money moves that you make, you need to be able to like account for those on your, on your. Financial statements. So if you, if you can keep your own kind of running tally of everything that you might need to include, it'll be a lot quicker to fill out those, those financial statements for the banks.

They're usually only going to be, it needs to be current within, I think, 90 days of close, right? So if you start your lending process today, you fill out your, your financial statement, but you don't actually close for four months, then you're probably going to need to fill another one out. Right before you close[00:19:00] 

after you do all of the paperwork, there's a deeper interview and this this is where the lender is trying to find holes in the deal before he presents it to his credit review team because they want to make sure that they're able to defend a deal. Before they submit things for review. And so if there's any doubts or anything that they think that the credit team is gonna call out as a risk, they're gonna try to press on it as much as they can.

And this is where I think having, having those answers ready to go is, is gonna be really, really helpful.

One of the bi, one of the deals that we did, we did a pre-business valuation before we went to underwriting. This was just kind of like a way to, uh, weed out any deals that weren't gonna. You know, they weren't going to pan out because the business didn't value the 1st deal. We did. We didn't do this. So it's bank to bank, [00:20:00] right?

Then we went to an initial credit review. So this is before we got a term sheet. The credit review team is checking the financial statements. They're doing like, just a cursory review of everything. Any questions that come back from credit, you'll have to go through some hoop jumping. That's where you have to be able to, like, come up with some creative solutions.

So one of our deals, there was some client concentration, so we needed to be able to, like, find ways to get rid of that risk in the credit team's eyes. We did that through increasing the seller note. Um, I mean, that was the main way that we were able to do that. Then you usually have to submit a business plan that typically is going to include projections for two years.

Um, 1 of the banks that we did was super meticulous about making sure that we showed the work on those projections. The 1st deal, not so much. It was a little strange. We got pretty far in the process [00:21:00] before they were like, oh, yeah, can you give us some projections as well? Yeah, you never know after that.

We've got a term sheet. So, term sheet tells you what they're offering to lend, but it's before they went through formal underwriting. Right? So, once you get your term sheet and you and you sign off on that. Yeah. That's typically when they're going to run your credit and, and, and go through the formal underwriting process.

That's important because I don't think anybody wants their credit ran 7 times, right? So understanding at what point the bank is going to run credit is important in case things fall out with that lender. Banks also don't like to see it kind of like credit checks on, on. You know, on your credit recently, so I think it's just helpful to know, but every bank they did this at a slightly different part of the process.

So this is why having them explain the full lending process from start to finish is helpful. And I would actually ask them that question. And when do you run [00:22:00] credit? We had 1 bank run our credit without telling us. They just kind of did it within about a week of us starting conversation with them. And honestly, it was a little irritating.

So yeah, it's worth asking after the formal underwriting, it usually takes about two weeks, you'll get your commitment letter. That's the formal offer. Typically when you sign your commitment letter, you have to put a little bit of money down. It's it's it's um, I don't know what to call it. It's a commitment fee, I guess, is what it is.

Um, it's probably based off the size of your deal. So not, not sure how to, how to prepare you for that. Cause I'm sure you guys all have different deal sizes that you're going for. Um, but once you sign your commitment letter, then you're going to move into the closing process. We really didn't touch on the closing process here.

Speaker 1 Uh, this is all like pre commitment letter up to that point can take anywhere from, you know, [00:23:00] three weeks to 30 days, 35 days to get to that point. Um, it depends on how quickly you're able to get some of this information together. The report that you have with your lender, the deal itself. So a lot, a lot of things that can play into it, but the underwriting typically took about two weeks, uh, to get questions back.

And then most banks are going to do another business valuation. And then you go hard into the closing process, which is it's, it's, yeah, it's own really fun set of ups and downs and rollercoaster rides. Speaker 1

Yeah, I don't really know that there's a whole lot else to say here. I think I kind of already, um, yeah, mentioned this, but break your own list of personal assets and liabilities. Just just make sure that you're keeping that straight because you [00:24:00] really don't want to have to start from scratch every time.

It's they're just they're tedious. They're just very, very tedious. And then again, managing expectations, right? So continue to manage the broker. Some some sell side brokers are going to push really hard for updates. Mhm.

Our advice, and again, this, this is just from our experience, we didn't want to enter into formal diligence until we had, we had lending confirmed because we didn't want to incur the costs. Since we were trying to do 2 deals, we were trying to manage our resources really, really efficiently. We didn't want to go into diligence until we, we knew that we were going to be able to get lending.

That's also, um, in part because we had to go through so many lenders before we got the green light on that 1st deal. Um, and then when we were going for lending on the [00:25:00] 2nd deal, it was, we needed to find a lender who was willing to lend within 3 months of us closing an SBA. Well, so that was actually kind of a challenge as well.

Right? Most lenders wanted us to wait 6 months at least. And so it was, it was. There was always a question mark and we just wanted to make sure that we weren't incurring costs until we had secured the lending. So some, some brokers are going to be really, um, yeah, they're going to be really, really sharp about that.

They're going to want to try to push you into diligence as soon as you can. Um, our advice from our experience is hold firm, but if you, uh, if you are having trouble securing lending, it's likely the case other buyers are probably going to have trouble on that as well. There's something about the deal that, that.

Banks are maybe shying away from there's almost always a lender who is willing to entertain it. And every time you go through the [00:26:00] process, you're probably going to get a lot better at managing those expectations from the lending side. So if it's a deal that you're excited about and you're confident.

That you've managed the risk. Well, that doesn't mean that you won't be able to get it done. Just know that, you know, if a, if a, if a broker is hounding you because things are taking too long, it's, it's not just about you. You are a qualified buyer. Other buyers are probably going to have a similar, similarly difficult time to find lending.

And I think that is,

I think that is, uh, the presentation that we got for you, Athena. 

**Athena:** Ah, there's so much going on. I took so many notes that I want to dig into and I'm sure people might have questions too. But, um, before we get into the questions about the process, I'm wondering if you would be able to. Give us a synopsis of what the closing process looks like, feels like, you know, just to give them a kind of preview of what happens next, because we didn't, we didn't [00:27:00] dig into it, but I think it's useful to hear if you can summarize, cause I know it's very complicated.

**Kevin:** I honestly, it's, it's, it's, if you're good at managing. Like somebody who's detail oriented and good at managing others get through it just fine. You really will. We had some frustrations that popped out that were like there weren't anybody's fault. They were just the way that things played out. Um, what I will say is that every bank's clothing process, the same that their lending process is different.

The closing processes are different. So the 1st bank that we had, they managed their closing process internally. So we send our commitment letter. We were introduced to a closer. The closers job is to coordinate is they just relay information between you. And there were four different review teams on the back end.

They don't they didn't all do their review at the same time. So what it actually ended up [00:28:00] feeling like is, you know, you would meet with your closer. You get this checklist of 30 to 40 items that we're gonna need to be dealt with between that moment and close. You'd submit everything that you needed to submit.

They'd submit it to a review team. The review team would kick something back. You'd solve that. And you're like, Oh, I'm golden. Great. Like they just reviewed my purchase agreement. They had two things that they said. Now we're moving past that. But what would actually happen is it would go to the next review team and they would bring other things out that they needed to have adjusted.

So there were, there were four internal review teams that it went through before it went to the SBA. And so it was just this constant, like, I thought we had already dealt with this and then having to go back to the seller and get either more information or make some tweaks to the agreement or whatever it may be.

So. It was the other piece of it is we were [00:29:00] trying to hold tight to a timeline. And so I was trying to manage both sides, the seller and the closer. To keep things moving at the pace that we wanted to move at and that probably put some, some. Extra stress onto the situation, but I my general takeaway from the closing process is it is it is a little chaotic.

Nothing is black and white. Everything is a little negotiable except for the things that aren't and you never really know what is negotiable and what's not. I will say that having Mathias and Pioneer Capital going through the process with us on the first deal made it a night and day difference. I mean, he was the world's best advocate for getting us, getting us over the line.

I think this is also where making sure that you have a lender who's really [00:30:00] like smart and capable and willing to go to bat for you. Is also helpful the deal that we did 1st was with Huntington bank, the lender that we use there. Like, he's he's incredible. He was able to get things waived by the SBA that we thought we're going to keep us from closing.

But it's, it's, you know, you think you're on the goal line and then you realize that you're. You know, 20 yards from even seeing the goal line at times is what it feels like. So, but it moves quickly. Everything's super fast paced. The faster that you can get things together and to respond and the more consistent you can be in your cadence with them.

I think the smoother things go. The 2nd deal that we did, which was, which was Lindsay's deal. And so she did most of that close. They, um, they outsourced their closing team. So they use a third party closing team that was actually pretty smooth up until the last like week and a half. So every bank's different.

The closing processes are [00:31:00] different. There's always going to be wrenches that get thrown in at the 11th hour. It just, it just is part of the process. And so I think you have to embrace the uncertainty and just hour through it. And you get through 

**Athena:** that was a really great segue. Um, which is 1 of the things I wanted to dig into because you've experienced both the broker and going direct.

So, like, you know, what would you recommend? Like, did you like the experience on both sides? Would you do it any differently? No. 

**Kevin:** So, I, I think going with the brokers. Invaluable. Like, I think if, if all things are equal, if you, if you're able to work with a broker, you don't pay the broker, the bank pays the broker.

So at the end of the day, it's not really, there's not a whole lot of reason not to [00:32:00] the reason we didn't use a broker for the second deal is, is because we were threading a needle with the timing of the lending. And so we had a lender that we had already been introduced to. Cool. Off the back of the first deal who was willing to go forward and Lindsay is particularly well equipped at at managing that type of a process on her own.

And so we made it through without a lending broker on the 2nd deal. I think if I'm being perfectly honest, I would have really struggled doing it without without a lending broker. I don't think I would ever do that process without it was really, really. I mean, you had you had an advocate in your corner.

The whole time. 

**Athena:** Um, and yeah, when folks are ready and at that stage, we love making introductions to folks that we know, including the brokers and you know, the brokers are aware of our fees and how we work and that sort of thing. So that can also be [00:33:00] good to have an advocate on that side of things for you.

Um, one of the things that came up on your first deal was real estate and leases. You were going to talk through that because I think that's a big gotcha that people don't realize is coming. 

**Kevin:** Yeah. So the two mistakes that I made on the first deal that were, I don't, I don't, well, the real estate part almost derailed the deal.

Um, the other one was, it just was almost a massive delay. I didn't start getting my purchase agreement done until we were. In the closing process, so the first bank was okay with that. They let us walk and chew gum at the same time, but we were supposed to submit everything for final review at least 7 days before the close date.

And I think we got them our final purchase agreement like 5 days before close. So, I mean, it was. Incredibly stressful trying to get the last [00:34:00] bits of the purchase agreement worked out. So I would, I would definitely say, like, once you've gotten your commitment letter, like, go full steam ahead on your purchase agreement so that you can get in front of that.

The 2nd. Deal that bank wouldn't let us even start working on the other closing item checklist until the purchase agreement was approved. So, it could be a massive delay, depending on the banks process, the real estate piece. So, the advertising agency that we closed on is in San Antonio. We live in Austin.

Um, the plan was to commute. It's not a business that really needs an office space, but the business does operate in person currently. And so it was going to take some time to go fully remote. So, we didn't want to just rip the bandaid and go fully remote, but because we were going to have an office, the SBA wanted to require that we have a lease.

With at least options to renew for the length of the SBA loan. It's pretty standard stuff. So they [00:35:00] wanted us to have at least a one year lease with nine options to renew. We didn't get introduced to the existing landlord until two weeks before close. This was It was a mistake. We should have, we should have really forced that conversation much, much sooner because what ended up happening is we had absolutely no time to go, to go find another solution.

We thought it wasn't going to be an issue. Turns out the landlord in his nineties had no interest in a 10 year lease. Wasn't going to do it. Would it do options at all? Wouldn't even consider them. So he just said no. And we were left sitting there saying, well, I don't know what we're going to do. So we were able to get our lender to get the 10 year requirement waived, but we still had to have a lease.

They wanted us to do 3 option years, but the guy wouldn't do any options. So we settled on a 3 year lease. [00:36:00] So the downside I want to go remote next year. I've got a 3 year lease. It's not super expensive. I can sublet it, but it's definitely something that, that if I could go back and do it again, I, I would have handled that conversation much, much earlier.

**Athena:** Yeah, so like highlight, you know, getting introduced to the landlord much earlier and also realizing SBA is going to require you if there's a physical space, typically to have lease options for the total amount of the loan, which is 10 years. So it's something that you want to. Have a conversation with the lender about and there's something I want to highlight here that that Kevin's glossing over and Lindsay does too is their problem solving ability.

So they don't take no for an answer, but they do it in a really great way. It's always looking for solutions and looking how to solve the problem. So when a problem came up with the lenders, with the sellers, et cetera, it's first getting to understanding what the problem is. What the [00:37:00] options are, then proposing solutions for how to overcome it.

And what we see a lot of people do is like, they get a no, or they get a challenge, and then they just assume, oh, SBA says no. And it's like, actually, the lender does not speak on behalf of the SBA. The SBA has very few, you know, we know the SBA rules, but the lender has interpretations of that. They have their own bank requirements.

They have their own preferences. They have the things that they like their own processes, et cetera. So, if if a lender says, no, that does not necessarily mean SBA says no, you know, so it's, it's really trying to discern and, you know, Lindsay and Kevin as our formidable team, because. Kevin has a ton of sales experience, consultants of sales experience and Lindsay's operations and project management.

So between the 2 of them, they're able to kind of navigate this. So all of you are going to have to put on your sales hat, your project management hat, you know, solution finding hat, because the lenders are, [00:38:00] they're By design, looking for risk, right? Not solutions. So they're, they're just going to be like, this is a problem.

Right? And it's like, up to you to be like, well, if we did this, would this work, et cetera, et cetera. So, to, to the, to the effect for your all loans and situations, because of getting creative, we 3x your buying power. We were able to overcome some of those initial objections through creative structuring just by.

Not taking over an answer, but not being like, no, I won't take that. It's like, well, what if we did this? And how about this? And would this overcome this? And is this a possibility? 

**Kevin:** That's actually that's a really great point and a good example. Um, so, you know, 1 of the things that I'd mentioned in that in that slide deck was understanding the root of the concern.

So. You know, SBA kind of has this blanket rule. You need a, you need a lease that, that, you know, runs the full length of the loan, right? It's unclear a lot of times [00:39:00] what's coming from the SBA and what's coming from the lenders. So I think that's the first thing. So lenders not always going to know, to be perfectly honest, like they just don't.

They'll say it's the SBA, it's the SBA. But if you push hard enough, a lot of times it's the lender, it's the lender's interpretation of what the SBA says, right? The second piece was, well, why did they want, why did they want you to have a lease for that, that full length of the loan? It's in case you default, they wanna be able to go seize assets, right?

So in that lease, they're gonna have you give a subordination clause so that the lender has first right to go into the property to seize any physical assets. So with our deal, there's not a lot of physical assets. I mean, very, very little. The amount that they would be able to seize and resell would be, it wouldn't move the needle at all on any type of a default on the loan.

So that was the case that we made back to the lender and our lender agreed. So he went and he pushed back and was able to get the requirement waived. 

**Athena:** Love that. Um. One of [00:40:00] the points that you made about like selling yourself and this is your business and I think people aren't aren't necessarily fully prepared for the fact that you're going to have to defend avidly why you are the custodian of a multi million dollar loan to run this business.

Right? So some of the things that lenders feedback to me and things that will cause them to just be like, Nope, absolutely not somebody, you know, looking at a location. In a completely different place that requires physical presence and not moving there or somebody not leaving their job to go and run the business or, you know, saying, I'm going to get somebody else in to run it, you know, and then you can in theory, you do those things sometimes, but then you're also going to have to build in the case.

They're going to have to meet this person. They're going to have to understand the business plan. They're going to have to vet them. Right? So, um, Um, it's not just looking at the business and how it performed. It's very much scrutinizing you as the [00:41:00] person that they are going to give millions of dollars to.

And it's like, do we believe that you have the capability to run this business? And are you saying things that are making us worried that we're going to not get our month back? So, can you speak a little bit more to the selling yourself and giving them confidence? In that regard, or things that maybe you said early on when you were just getting to know them that like, you're like, oh, crap, that's not good.

We got to stop doing that sort of thing. 

**Kevin:** Yeah, I mean, I think I think the 1st, you know, there were definitely lenders that I spoke with that in hindsight now, like, fast forward 7, 8 months. Like, I think back to this 1st conversation. I was like, well, no, no wonder that 1 didn't go anywhere. Of course it didn't.

Right? Like, I didn't really position myself. As, as somebody that they, they should have confidence in. So it was, it was a learning experience throughout. Um, I, so with, with my [00:42:00] deal in particular, so the agency, which is the one that I'm running and my, my wife got a landscape design and build company in Austin.

So, you know, these are, both of these companies are outside of our direct experience. So, you know, I've spent the last 10 years doing sales, software sales. In PR and marketing, that's very different than running a marketing agency. And so I think being able to position the experience that I have in a way that helped give them confidence that I was going to be able to step in And learn what is effectively a new industry and run the agency.

It took a little practice and it, and it was definitely critical to getting the deal over the line. Yeah. Because that was one of the things that was pressed on the hardest was, you know, there were, there were two sellers leaving there's me entering. So I need to fill two sellers shoes and I need to be able to [00:43:00] demonstrate with enough.

You know, reasonable confidence that I'm going to be able to use my experience in the tangential industry. So effectively run, run the agency. So that was, that was, I think one of, yeah, those types of examples. 

**Athena:** Yeah. And you know, Ryan and the team and us, like when you, when y'all get close on something, we're going to be like, okay, why is this your business?

Right. And we're trying to get you all bought into why. It is your business because we know you're about to have to go and pitch yourself through this process. Right. So if you can't convince yourself as to why it's your business, it's, it's going to end up being a blocker that you don't necessarily need when you get to the lending part.

So really getting that, like, no, I am meant to run this business. I'm excited about this business. And this is why, and this is why my experience translates. So we wouldn't put something in front of you if we didn't see that initial connection, but you have to sell [00:44:00] yourself on it. So then you can go and sell.

Other people on it too. And I, I think we made the, the distinction early on. But what I loved about Kevin and Lindsay is like, originally it was like, well, Lindsay was going to get a business. Right. And then, and then we ended up finding the ones that they were both like, we each want one. Right. So I think that probably played into how they were able to get to done it and why it made sense to do too, because they're supporting each other.

You know, with, with skill sets and stuff, but there's still like each of them matched themselves to the business that they were most suited and most excited about running with the support of the other. So it was like, you know, Kevin is, is leading one. Lindsay is leading the other and they have different skill sets and excitement levels about the business that, that, that made them, you know, decide that.

**Kevin:** And it did take a little convincing. So, you know, Lindsay supports me with operations a lot in the agency. I'll be supporting her with sales and [00:45:00] marketing. And I mean, it was almost by design. We have a, now we have a business that will kind of be a natural client of the, the ad agency that we have. Um, not every bank was willing to look at it like that, right?

Like, what do you mean? She's going to be running her own business, but running operations for you. What do you mean your husband who just closed on a business is going to help you with sales and marketing? So it, it, it definitely took, you know, you had to be confident about it. That's really what it came down to.

We had to be really confident. This is exactly what we're doing. And this is going to work. And, and it is, 

**Athena:** you got, you guys got more confident as you went on. Like, that was cool. Because initially you were like, we were talking about it a lot. Like. Is this crazy? Does this, you know, and what landed on is like, if you're searching as an individual, you would get your own business.

Right. And it's like, so as long as it still made sense, and I think that was what was important at you were [00:46:00] under offer on one and you kept looking at deals, you know, to get gut checks and see, and then you're like, Oh my gosh, like actually this opens up a pathway that. We, we hadn't explored before, but the, the further you went along, the more you all like literally got bought in.

And you're like, no, this, this makes sense. And, and that showed right. And the confidence level to be able to go in and go through that whole process. Um, so something just a few little, like, points, you know, because you, you mentioned the commitment fee at signing that gets wrapped up into the loan and goes towards your equity injection.

Um, and then the business valuation that the bank might pull initially, that's not something you pay if the bank's like, no, we want to do a valuation up front and then. Yeah, 

**Kevin:** correct. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So, so the, the, the valuation up front was it call it an evaluation white. I mean, honestly, what it was, and, and, and we've only seen 1 lender that [00:47:00] does it, um, he's great.

By the way, I'm sure, you know, Athena introduced us to this guy. Like, he really, he's another 1 of those lenders who's going to go to bat for you. Who's who's just very on top of this stuff. Um, but he just likes to do an evaluation up front to make sure that the business. Yeah. Price checks out, right? Um, yeah, we didn't, we didn't have to pay for that.

You do have to pay for the 2nd 1, but it's wrapped into the loan. 

**Athena:** Yeah, so you can talk through like, you know, what are the costs up front? What are we going to have to pay up front? It's applied to the equity injection, you know, so you kind of want to have those discussions up front, like the line of credit because.

I would argue that you should probably have a line of credit extended in every single deal, just so you know that it's there because after you close and like you, you know, if you made it and you didn't negotiate it up front, it's gonna be a lot harder to be able to get it in. 

**Kevin:** It'll be, it'll be what the winners told us, [00:48:00] which, which.

Taking our own advice here, maybe like, it's almost never a no, like, it's like, but what, what the lenders, what most lenders told us is that after we close the loan, it would be almost impossible to go back and get a line of credit because that line of credit would have to be subordinated to the SBA, the primary SBA loan.

And so only a lender who's giving you both is going to be willing to give you that 2nd line of credit. Um. You wouldn't have any assets to lend against at that point. It would already be claimed by the SBA loan effectively. So, and what we found, and I don't know if this is actually if this correlation is actually there, or if it's just what it seems like, but what it kind of started to become clear kind of seem like is that.

The banks that are going to hold your loan for the life of the loan are going to be willing to do an express line of credit of credit. The banks that are going to repackage and sell your SBA loan are probably [00:49:00] not going to be willing to do one because they're not going to hold the hold the loan so they can't really offer that future line of credit.

So what those banks do instead is they'll just bake in a larger working capital number. The downside of that is that you're guaranteed to pay the interest rate. On that working capital number, then, whereas with a line of credit, it's an option to draw on. So so my line of credit is it's a 5 year line of credit and then it converts to a 5 year loan at the end of the 1st, 60 months.

So, if I don't draw anything off of that line of credit, I don't, I don't. There's no interest added. I don't, it doesn't add anything to the total cost of my SBA loan. But if you, if you roll all of those dollars into a working capital infusion, then you're, you're going to pay the interest on it, whether you use the dollars or not.

**Athena:** And like having, just having that as a safety net. And peace of mind, you know, we know that after you take over a business is likely going to be [00:50:00] a rough couple of years before you get it back on track. So just knowing that you have that available, but I, I have a friend that some of us know and business, you know, stop performing the way that they thought and they were scrambling trying to find money afterwards because they didn't have that line of credit available and, um, meant that they started defaulting on payments.

I mean, it's, It's horrible to not have that. So the peace of mind there. Um, I, I've been asking all the questions. I haven't seen any hands up, but do know that if you do have questions for Kevin, like, throw your hands up. But also, lucky you guys, he's in the buyers club, slack channel and Lindsay is too. And they've been like, really great about answering questions and stuff.

So if you have any questions while we're here, throw your hands up. Another thing that I just wanted to pull out that you touched on that I think is, is really important is that the sequence, right? And you can end up spending a lot of money after a lie before you actually [00:51:00] close and you want to sequentially do it in a way that you're, you're protecting yourself from having broken deal costs.

So what Kevin was saying about making sure that you hold off on the due diligence. Aspects before you get a term sheet, because if you can't get a term sheet from a lender, then the chances of you being able to get that deal done are very slim. So, if you've activated your, um, QV, if you've activated your legal team to start drawing your purchase agreement before, you know, that a lender is willing to extend a term sheet to you, then Bye bye.

Um, you know, you just risk losing that money as opposed to holding out. Like, you can talk to those people and let them know, like, hey, I'm going to want to work with you. Here's what's coming. Please hold off before I get a term sheet from a lender. And then for some of you, and we did this on one of Kevin's deals, the brokers are like, you know, well.[00:52:00] 

We don't want to give you the exclusivity period for the full, you know, and we know that SBA deals with due diligence and everything are probably going to take 90 to 120 days. So you try to want to build in the longer exclusivity period, but, you know, they, they, they get burned a lot of the times on people that make offers that can't actually get the deal done or they're not confident in you being able to close it because you're a first time buyer.

So you can build in something where it's like, hey, we're going to get you a term sheet. Within 30 days, which, you know, that's what we built into 1 of yours and it took longer than that, but you were able to show them that you were working on it. And also, like you said, if we're struggling, other people are going to struggle.

So it's better to see if we can actually get this done. And then an automatic, you know, and then it buys you more of that exclusivity period once you're able to get that. So that's a good way to try to demonstrate to the brokers and and and sellers that, you know, we can finance the deal. The 1st thing we're [00:53:00] going to work on is getting you a term sheet.

We'll get that within 30 to 45 days. And then once we get that to you, then, you know, the full exclusivity period for due due diligence will be activated. 

**Kevin:** Yeah, what I would say about that is like, um, the things that we felt really timid about asking for from the brokers on the 1st, go around where. Like, we didn't have any of those hesitations when we were going into an offer on the second business, like, we felt much more, um, empowered to ask for what we needed in the deal, and I think that it helped us move things along.

The broker wants the deal to close. That's really all that they, that's the main thing that they care about. You know, more more than anything else, if they have a buyer who they think can get the deal done, they're going to they're going to work with you to try to advocate on your behalf to the sellers.

So, you know, to Athena's point, we started out with 30 days of [00:54:00] exclusivity. We I mean, it took us 3 months to get our term sheet. You know, after we, we got the first offer signed, it might have actually been a little bit longer than that, but we were able to like demonstrate that we were more than capable of doing it and, and, and we were, you know, moving the negotiations on that, that agreement forward while we were, you know, working with the lenders.

And so I think managing those expectations was the reason we were able to continue to extend that exclusivity period. 

**Athena:** Good point. All right. I see. Steve has his hand up. Steven. Polly. What's your question for Kevin?

**Steve:** So, hey, Kevin, first of all, thank you for sharing the story today. Your experiences. Um, I've got two questions, two whole questions. So the first one, you started to sit on it, uh, as a matter of fact, in that last comment, is in any point, did you find that the lender and pressing some of the questions helped you negotiate an [00:55:00] even better deal, uh, with the seller?

And the second one, the second part of that question is, um, in the, let's call it lack of enthusiasm from some of the vendors. How much of a mind screw with your mind? Uh, is this a good deal? Did you start questioning the deal itself because the lenders were pressing so hard asking really tough questions?

**Kevin:** Yeah, those are good questions. Um, so we'll, we'll start with the first one. Um, so yeah, did, did, did the, the questions, the pressing, the poking holes, did any of that help us go back and negotiate a better deal? Yeah, it absolutely did. So what's funny is we almost. Yeah, we, we kind of like, I wouldn't, I wouldn't say we ruined a great opportunity to build in more risks or more, more protection, um, very late in the deal with our 1st, with the 1st deal that we did, you know, we, we had a seller note that was about 3rd.

I think it's. [00:56:00] 37 percent of the total deal is in a forgivable seller note. And then we had, we split the equity injection with them on top of that. So we based our seller note. The forgiveness period was the first 12 months of performance from close. The bank came back to us after we'd had commitment letter and told us, I'm sorry, guys, you're 24 months.

Right. So they, they, they told us that the note that we had in place didn't offer enough protection. They needed us to extend that period. We actually thought that that was going to be an unmanageable ask of the sellers that there was no way that they were going to be willing to let the money sit for, for a full 24 months before they were, they were able to start like seeing any type of, even like a guarantee of payment.

Right. So we pushed back on the bank. Okay. The bank waived the requirement. We did a little more modeling [00:57:00] and realized that they were right. We needed a little more protection. So now we went from having an opportunity where we could have just pointed to the bank and said, Hey, guys, I'm so sorry, but we're gonna have to revisit this.

The bank won't move forward unless we're able to extend that forgiveness period to having to make the case on our own without the bank support. Because we'd already told him, Hey, guys, guess what? We pushed back on the bank for you. We got that waved. We're good to go. And then, and then turns out we had to go back to them.

So what we ended up doing is we, we split the seller note into two forgivable notes. So now we have three seller notes. We had the equity injection, and then we had two forgivable notes. A 3rd of the total forgivable note was based off the 1st, 12 months performance 2 3rds of it's based off of months, 12 to 24.

so we were able to build in that protection, but really, we probably should have just done it when the bank asked us to. so that was that was 1 time that we probably should have slowed down a little bit. And done done the [00:58:00] modeling then, because we actually would have it would have been an easier argument.

So, yeah, there were definitely some times that the things that they were pushing on informed the way that we thought about the deal structure. There were some earlier on that, you know, the size of the forgivable note that we asked for, um. Yeah, I mean, we worked pretty closely with 1 of the lenders to end up.

We were just so far outside of their deal box. They were never going to do it, but she helped us. She helped us do a lot of the initial modeling and structure. The forgivable note the way that we did, and then the 2nd question that you had asked, I'm sorry, I'm blanking. Can you can you remind me of the 2nd question?

**Steve:** Yeah. So, uh, when the lender came up with these. They're not quite as excited about the deal as you are going. It's got it. Questioning yourself. Is this a bad deal of making my making a mistake? 

**Kevin:** Yeah, absolutely. When, I mean, [00:59:00] I'm not kidding when I say that we spent two months working with a lender. And like, after we submitted, we got our signed LOI, like when we were, when we were negotiating, you know, the, what was unique about our deals, we did a lot of the negotiating upfront before we even had the signed LOI, we had negotiated a good portion of the deal structure.

We lucked out, the sellers wanted to do that. The broker wanted us to do that. They weren't shopping it around while we were negotiating those things, it just worked right. But then we worked for, for a solid two, maybe two and a half months with this lender. Who, who we thought was our partner in this and then it just felt like the rug got pulled out from under us and they were like, sorry, guys, I'm not submitting this to my underwriting team.

Our bank doesn't want to touch it and that, that was a pretty, there was like a two week period where we were like, what are we going to do? How are we going to find a lender for this? Like, [01:00:00] does, should we walk away? Yeah, definitely. I think for us, it took, we needed to clear our head. We needed to go back to the modeling.

We had conversations with Athena. And Ryan and the team about what we're looking for. Why were we interested in it in the first place? And then and then it's having an honest conversation with yourself. Like, there is risk in every deal. This is a risky thing that you're doing is the risk that you're looking at.

Manageable based on your skill sets. Have you built in enough protection into your deal structure? And are you confident that this deal is the right deal for you? And for us, the answer was yes. And we, we, we doubled down. We turned around and we started having conversations with as many lenders as we could.

That's when we were introduced to Matthias over at pioneer capital. And from, from that point, we were actually able to move forward pretty quickly. Yeah, it strengthened our [01:01:00] resolve. It definitely. Some doubts, like, I mean, that is absolutely true. Once we made the decision that like, yes, those, those risks are there and, and we understand why some banks aren't gonna want to touch it.

We, we, you know, dove in. 

**Steve:** I know Justin's hands up, but one lack Last quick one, uh, on this one is after you close. Some of the fears of the lender. Did you see were just totally unfounded or Pretty much spot on. 

**Kevin:** No, no 

**Steve:** their risks. 

**Kevin:** They're good at their job They're they're good at their job. They have a deal box for a reason.

Right? Like what it was about that bank. They didn't want to touch anything that had to do with creatives. Right? In their opinion, when the creative left the business left. Right? And so it's an ad agency. We don't do the actual creative work, but there's still that kind of like, [01:02:00] um, you know, gathering of the minds type of people.

Right. Component to it where you have these, these two sellers with an incredible amount of experience that have built this business. So, you know, we had to justify to the other banks about how strong the team in place was. But when we closed, yeah, I mean, like there have definitely been moments where I've stepped in and been like, Holy shit, guys, what, what are we doing here?

You know? And, and it's, it's been scary. It's been exciting. There's been ups and downs. Um, it's not smooth sailing. From start to finish, but it is something that we're committed to doing, and we are making it work, but they are usually spot on time spot on the risks exists. Yeah. 

**Athena:** Yeah. And like, really great questions, Steven.

And, you know, Kevin's absolutely right. Like these folks look at deals all day long. [01:03:00] So their whole job is like, how do we protect the money that we're giving you? And in effect, it's helping you see things that you didn't necessarily see before. So, I love that Kevin and Lindsey pulled out the reframe opportunity when the banks are drilling you on certain things, rather than being like, oh, they're attacking me.

It's like, hey, this is what we're doing. They're seeing something here in their experience that we need to dive into and how can we mitigate the risks? So, you know, this forgivable notes structure is fantastic because it, it allows them to protect a large amount of the downside the bank was uncomfortable with before, and they're uncomfortable with it for good reason.

Um, and then allows you to think about like, okay, the bank's highlighting all of these things that might be problems. Now we get to think, think through the solutions and like business owners. Before we even take over the business, how can we like think about things that if that does happen, we'll have something in place.

What an amazing opportunity is the business owner to like, foresee the [01:04:00] issues that you might have and be able to think through the risk mitigation and how you might handle that. Before it actually happens so that when you do get into the driver's seat you're aware of the things that they saw and you have potential strategies to overcome that and it doesn't hit you as hard when it happens because you're kind of expecting it.

But also to Kevin's point, it's, it's one of the reasons why we have the thesis that we do that. It's so, so, so important that you all emotionally connect with these opportunities and you see yourself in that business and why you want to run that business because this stuff will and can come up and if it's just purely like an investment, like I want to park my money somewhere, which I don't think any of you are trying to do, but like, you know, if you get excited about something, if you feel passionate about something and you're up for, Um, The challenge and it will be challenging no matter what business you take over, then you'll have that kind of passion to be able to find the solutions and overcome it when it comes up.

**Kevin:** But the [01:05:00] last thing I would say there though, because I really do think that's a really great question is the same way that, you know, the business that you're looking at probably isn't, wouldn't feel like a good fit for me. It's the same for the banks, right? Like, so when, when, when we were able to stop, and I think Athena said this really well, Seeing the objections as an attack, right?

Or or an indication of a lack of vote of confidence and just understanding that, no, it's just that this deal isn't right for that bank. Right? So go back and make sure that you're, you're like, actually understanding the root causes of the concerns that they're bringing. Make sure that you've. Thought through those things, address them, you know, the amount of client concentration in our business was, was pretty scary.

And when, when we had some banks pass on it, it caused a little bit of the doubt, but we modeled if we lost that biggest client, [01:06:00] what happens, right? And so that that's how we arrived at the deal structure that we did. We just should have done it a little sooner when the bank was telling us to do it. And maybe we could have renegotiated with them as the bad guy.

So. 

**Athena:** Great questions. Um, cool. Thanks, Steve and Polly. Justin, I know you had your hand up and you took it back down. I don't know if you wanted to jump in and ask a question. 

**Justin:** Yeah, it was mostly just because Kevin and Steve nailed the question I was going to ask. I got to it. It was just around the hair on the misalignment for the, uh.

Um, view box like breakdown and and if it was just a matter of not speaking to the industry as early and specifically that maybe would have triggered the red flag on their side, um, in learning, like, they didn't want to handle creative. There's, you know, something like that. 

**Kevin:** I think, um, that's a great question.

I think the more that you can go into these conversations with some confidence and you're willing to get in front [01:07:00] of the hurdles. So the difference between the 1st lender that we've worked with and the 2nd lender is that we shied away from the fact that, you know, there was there was client concentration.

And those upfront conversations and that this is inherently like, it's, we bought the transfer of relationships. That's really what we bought. Right? So some banks will never touch it. And that wasn't the direct conversation that we were having upfront, the lender that we ended up going in with. And my first conversations with him, I was telling him, look, there's a significant amount of client concentration upwards of 50 percent with our largest client.

We know that that's a risk. Here's how we've managed it. Right. And so. I was asking him, are you okay with that? Will you get on board? So I think it's, it's a different, we approached it very differently as we went through the process. 

**Athena:** I love that because you were confident and in terms of, [01:08:00] okay, we're aware of the problem and we've thought through how we're going to solve this, how we're going to structure it to protect us.

Like, this is a solution we've come up with. Are you cool with that? You know, and that that to a lender is like. Awesome, you know, they've thought through the problems that I'm going to ask instead of being like, no, I'm sure it's going to be fine, you know, and they're like, no, like, you lose that customer and like, there goes there goes our loan payment.

So. Um, you know, it's, it's the, again, in those, those initial early, you know, even though the lender passed on it, you were able to, like, uncover and solve for so many things. And funny enough, that lenders is kicking themselves for it down the line, you know, because they realized that they weren't thinking through the solutions.

Um, so, so that's kind of a funny silver lining. I mean, it didn't necessarily get you there, but it did school you in like how to see risk and overcome for it and come up with [01:09:00] solutions. And then you were finding a partner that saw your vision and believed in you versus. Please sir, can I have a loan? You know, it's just very different like energy level when you're asking for millions of dollars.

**Kevin:** It felt personal. The first, the first lender that pulled the rug out from under us, it was not personal. It was, it was never, it was never going to be, it just wasn't, you know, and there's a lot of lenders out there. There's, there's, you're not going to be the right fit for everybody. You as a buyer aren't going to be the right fit for everybody.

You might make mistakes in some conversations, but like part of what they're looking for is like your commitment to get the deal done because when things get hard after you've closed, they want to know that you're going to stick it out. 

**Athena:** Great question, Justin and welcome to the 1st meeting and I know you all know each other.

So it's fun little connection of the dots. Um, cool that answer your question, [01:10:00] Justin. Yeah, looks like awesome. Jason, I see your hand up and you're, you're literally at the precipice of about to have all these conversations. What's what's your question? 

**Jason:** Well, I've been having some of these conversations and, um, in some, in some aspects, I feel like I have some leverage because in some ways I feel like I'm.

Up against the wall because I have assets now. They're like, oh, well, you got all these assets. You need to offer some collateral So then i'm like, what can you do for me? So i'm curious What lever you've tried to pull I tried to pull the interest rate thing I was like, what can you do for me on the interest rates?

Can you drop it one percent and they're like, oh we can only do a quarter. I was like, but Try to use the never split the difference. It's like, but that's not going to work for me. Like, what can you, like, I'm curious, what other negotiations can I get out of a lender to get better terms? 

**Kevin:** Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

No, that's, that's, that's [01:11:00] interesting. I think, I mean, I, they're offering, I don't know what they're offering you. Right. Are they're offering you variable rates? 

**Jason:** Like, no, it's a fix. So it was like prime plus two. And I was like, well, can you do prime plus one? 

**Kevin:** Yeah, I would say. I'd be very impressed if you're able to find a prime plus one, but if you have the assets to back it versus the business to back it, then I think that that probably goes a long ways, but at the day, they're probably going to want to make their money off the loan, right?

So like, there's probably a hard floor, but you can always ask them like what their hard floor is. Yeah. Um, they might, I mean, I, I think you're going to have a whole lot more flexibility to get them to waive some of those requirements that you might run into as you go through, like you need a 10 year lease or you need, because like the whole thing is that they need to be able to seize assets if you default, but if, if you're guaranteeing it with assets outside of the business [01:12:00] that you're also putting on the line, then you'll have a lot more flexibility there.

I would, I would keep pushing on the rate because prime plus two is absolutely not the best that you'll find. And I would want to get that fixed for, for a period of time. Hopefully, hopefully rates come down, but like, I don't think they're going to come down in the next three years enough to like make a, you know, so basically what I got was I got prime plus 1.

95, six for three years, and then it goes to prime plus. Okay. Yeah, this was two and a quarter. This was prime plus two. 

**Jason:** It was 

**Kevin:** fixed for the entire one. You know, it's a, it's a, it's a fair question. I think that just, just, just keep asking the question, you know, get, get creative. Like, what, what would make you excited?

In a [01:13:00] deal, right? Like what? What kind of deal terms would would kind of get you a little excited and go ask. You go, go make the case for it, right? Like, you've got the assets. You're somebody they want to lend to. Our situation was a little bit different. You know, we were, we were definitely backing the loans because we have a very cash flow, heavy business.

And so it was, it was the cash flow that we were leaning on 

**Athena:** if it's, if it's based on prime, that would be variable based on the prime rate. Right? Instead of them saying, like, it's going to be fixed it 8 percent for the 1st, 3 years. So, prime adjusts basically, so that is a very yeah. Yes. 

**Jason:** Yeah, so it's based off.

**Kevin:** The fluctuation of 

**Jason:** prime 

**Kevin:** normally, they're going to they're going to it's going to be a quarterly adjustment. Right? So, for mine, they looked at prime plus 1. 95 at the time that the SBA loan was like, we got our loan number issued and they locked that for 3 years. Yeah, 

**Athena:** at that percentage rate. [01:14:00] So it was like fixed at this percent and then after that amount, it's going to be prime plus 2.

so whatever the prime ended up being and then it's variable and it's adjusted every quarter. So, 

**Kevin:** if prime falls out from under me, then that's unfortunate. I, I, you know, I, I could come out on the downside of that, but I don't, I don't think it will. I think. I don't think you'll see an SBA loan for under that 8.

95 point for a few years. Uh, who, what, 

**Jason:** who was that? Uh, I was like I said, I'm all to get Huntington, Huntington 

**Kevin:** national bank. Yeah. So they're a regional bank. I'd never heard of them. They're in Ohio. They're one of the larger SBA lenders. Um, only downside that I've ran into with working with them is one they're super aggressive and trying to get you to like, use them as your primary banking.

For your business. Um, that's okay. I was in sales. I can handle being pitched. The other [01:15:00] is, um, there's no branches in Texas and I'm in Texas. So you can't send a wire over the phone. You can't send a wire online. If I need to wire money, I would need to go to a bank in Ohio. So that was a little bit of a frustration to start, you know, so small things like that.

But other than that, they've, they've been a really great bank. 

**Athena:** Thanks. Awesome. Great questions. Um, Kevin, this was awesome. I think so much value just hearing your experiences and the fact that you had 2 very wildly different experiences, um, and and success, you know, on on both of them, despite a lot of a lot of challenges throughout the process.

So, um, appreciate all you've shared with everybody today. We're. 

So 

**Athena:** excited. It kind of, I know, I know number two is fairly new, but it's been fun kind of being on the, on the ride with you of like post transition. So might call you back to talk through like, what, [01:16:00] what to expect after and all the things you think it's done and it's not done, you know, there's, there's wild things that happen.

Through the transition and how to manage that and what can come up. So I'd love, you know, if y'all are up for it, I know I keep calling you out in front of people. 

**Kevin:** Athena, you know, that we, we will, the thing is, is we, we still, you know, Athena has been the best advisor that we've had throughout this entire process and one thing that I didn't really reiterate, I'm sure you guys all do, but like lean on her and the team to bounce ideas off of.

That was the most beneficial thing. And it's, it's the reason why I say having the lending broker was helpful, but Athena was there for us throughout the whole way. So, you know, we didn't have to find the solutions on our own. We were able to leverage the team that we had in our corner and I really cannot stress enough.

So, like, they know what they're doing. They know what they're talking about, [01:17:00] bounce ideas off of them, talk through the problems that you have and find solutions together. Yeah, 

**Athena:** I appreciate that. That's fun. I love that. Y'all came with that stuff though, too. You know, so it's like, we're, we're here. We want to support me, Ryan, Luke, all of us.

Like, we have so much exposure, all this and creative ideas and we get to see so many deals that we can, we can help you all see things that maybe you didn't realize might be an opportunity there. Um. Yeah. And, you know, again, I can't, I can't overstate enough just the resilience that you all had in the face of challenges, like, and most people would have given up after working with a lender for 2 months and having that not not work out.

And if anything, it just, it solidified your resolve and you're like, right, we're going on a road show. We're finding, you know, like, we're going to get this done. So, um, you know. I want to call that out not only because it's phenomenal, but because every single person here is going to have challenges as you go [01:18:00] through this process.

And they say a deal dies a 1000 times, you know, and it literally does like on the 11th hour. There's so many things that come up and that if you're prepared for that, knowing that's normal, then it's like, well, how can we overcome that? And how can we solve this problem? And even after you close, there's all sorts of things right?

And the seller doesn't necessarily. Necessarily understand the, what they signed and didn't, isn't, isn't operating in the way that you thought they would, and all of those sorts of things. So like getting, getting used to the problem solving upfront will make you more resilient and problem solving after it.

And it, it just kind of feels normal. It's like, oh, something's coming up and we gotta go with this now. You know? So, uh, yeah, I think, I think the way that you all have been attacking all of these challenges and the way that we you went through it is, um, fantastic and I really appreciate you guys. Um, we are going to be sharing the slides, uh, with the replay and also we [01:19:00] actually have a template, um, personal financial statements, so we're, it's, it's already put it on your dashboards and she's going to share the link here, but it's just a Google doc for you to be able to like, update all those numbers and, you know, I'd say every month, if you do a finance check in, like Kevin said, just go and fill those numbers out.

That's. So, at least you don't have to, like, pull that up when you're like, oh, God, we got to fill this out again. You just, you just have a document that you have with all of that. Um, and I think we're gonna, uh, see if we can't get some insights from your Q and a doc that you created for yourself too. And I think that was another call out.

I want to make, like, having your own Q, Q. Q and a, I'm like, trying to say QB and I'm like, that's not the right thing. You're your resource for yourself on all those questions. And even I imagine if you went back to it now, um, and looking at that document, it's like, there's probably a lot of helpful stuff in there that maybe you're revisiting and thinking about, um.

To you [01:20:00] know, it's a resource that can potentially support you even through transition. 

**Kevin:** I think absolutely it is. Um, it really was a fun experience to, like, go back and look at the emails as we got started. You know, trying to remember some of the timelines and specific ups and downs that we ran into. But then also, like, yeah, just putting ourselves back in that, like, frame of mind.

Um, it was it was kind of a fun experience for sure. 

**Athena:** Well, thank you again. Thanks everyone for staying late. I'd love to, like, really get under the hood. So thank you, Kevin. Give our best to Lindsay. Well, uh, we'll definitely see you back and maybe we can do a round two of, you know, closing and what comes next.

**Kevin:** I love it. I love it. Let me know. Awesome. 

**Athena:** Well, great to see everyone. We'll see you on Thursday. We're going to be here to support you on your challenges, questions. Structuring all the things use us to talk through [01:21:00] your problems and all of those things. So Thursday will be a session for you to do that. Um, thanks so much Kevin and thanks everyone.

We'll see you on Thursday. 

**Ryan:** Bye y'all. 

**Athena:** Bye.
