# AcquiMatch Buyers Club 02/25/2025

[00:00:00] 



**Athena:** Hello. Hello. Hello. Welcome. Welcome. I was going to say good morning, but it's clearly not the morning anywhere where any of us are at. Hey, Justin. Nice to see you. Hi, Polly. How's it going? Yeah, how are you doing? I'm good. The sun is shining again here in Austin. So that makes me happy. We had a, we had a week or 2 of just.

Not acceptable weather at all. So, uh, yeah, 

**Polly:** it's so beautiful here today. It's 76 degrees and sunny. I'm like, so happy. Just so happy. 

**Athena:** That sounds amazing. Well, cool, I see a few other folks in the waiting room, so go ahead and, you know, unmute or let us know if you're here because I actually wanted to.

Facilitate a little discussion about that last session that we were all in last week with Ranaan because there was a big one. It was a heavy one. And I think there was a lot of takeaways and [00:01:00] worth chatting about it before we dive into deal specific kind of conversations and learnings today. So, um, let us know if you're here.

I think I saw Joe, maybe you might be here. 

Joe's on. Hi. Hey, Joe. How are 

**Athena:** you? 

Hey, everyone. All right. 

**Athena:** Awesome. And then I think you might be here. Dustin might be here. So, uh, if you're here and you're comfortable, show us your face. If not, just let us know you're here. Um, and then, yeah, so last week we had a surprise or just, like, last minute confirmation of being able to join us and.

Getting an update on the like what happens after happily ever after from Renan and um, I know I definitely Got choked up at a couple points. So I think there's a lot of really interesting learnings and takeaways from his experience. And I thought it would be good for us to chat about [00:02:00] that today. And also how it made you feel.

Right? Did it scare you? And you're like, what the hell am I doing? I shouldn't be doing this. Or did it didn't make you double down and be like, okay, I know there's challenges, but I'm super excited about this. And I wanted to help. Uh, invite, uh, our team to the discussion as well. And I didn't get a chance last week, but David, uh, the face that you are seeing is our newest member of the team.

Um, so he's got a really interesting data growth hacking, uh, background, and he's going to be helping out the team to source even more off market leads and also responsible for. The deal flow in the vetting of that, too. So, David, if you want to just say, hi, real quick, and then we'll dive into the discussion.

Hi there. Nice to meet you. 

**Athena:** Super excited to have him here. He's a really excited about diving into all of your searches, too. So, if anyone's feeling brave and wants to give reflections on. [00:03:00] Renan's discussion last week, and how that landed, what came up for you.

Justin, I might call on you actually, because you haven't quite started your search yet. Were you here last week with Renan? Yeah, what did you think of that whole discussion? 

**Justin:** Yeah, um, it was, it was, uh, very, uh, brave of him for, for sure for sharing that and illuminated a lot of what I have researched independently, heard from some of the stories around how it's not always rosy and, you know, I would be lying if the human side of me wasn't a little, um, If it didn't remind me a little bit about some of the downside to this whole industry, what we're doing, [00:04:00] right?

Uh, it made it very real hearing his situation. Obviously, I'm glad to hear it's, you know, on the upswing. So that was inspiring that despite such setbacks. There's opportunity to be made out of something that, you know, generally can be seen as catastrophic in someone's, you know, life personally and professionally.

I mean, 

**Athena:** yeah, 

**Justin:** you know, I know that that I've talked with you in my kind of early onboarding and my, my largest fear at this point in my career and and my personal life is that. Uh, you know, I put what I've built in jeopardy, especially for in context of my family. And so, you know, hearing, you know, someone like, we're not with with kids and family and, you know, that his personal residence is on the line.

I mean, that kind of stuff. That's, that's, that's fearful for somebody like me because I'm in a similar place where, you know, I've got a home. I've got family to take care of. So, um, there's a, there's a psychological aspect to this for sure that you kind of have [00:05:00] to calculate and and mitigate as much risk as possible.

And that's kind of my whole position going into this endeavor. Uh, it's very much around. Mitigating as much risk as possible and safeguarding as much as possible. Um, but I mean, it was despite how challenging it is to hear some, a story like that. It's still incredibly valuable and, um, because it, it, it paints the real picture and kind of keeps this very grounded in the fact that, you know, there's, there's a lot of exposure, but there's a lot of work to be done and it could be good and potentially bad.

Um, Yeah, I mean, I'm, I'm still inspired and I obviously I'm still very committed. If anything, I just, it, it, for someone like me, it draws me into finding. Uh, new angles to basically protect myself or, or minimize that exposure, um, from the more common things that I hear recurring, you [00:06:00] know, folks in this space who have acquired what what can go wrong.

So, 

**Athena:** yeah, I think there's some, you know, specific learnings. From what he did after he bought the business to I'm wondering, like, what people because I, I have a lot of thoughts, but I also have had a lot more conversations with run on and my team knows this. Like, giving the answers. I think it's, it's more of a learning situation when you kind of like, try to tease it out.

So did you hear anything? Like major learnings about how he handled things after he bought the business or things he could have, you know, mitigated the risk for that were like specific takeaways that you got from that conversation. 

**Justin:** I know I took a big 1 away and actually talked about it with my wife afterward, you know, later that night, just recalling hearing his story and I think and again, this is absolutely no judgment against.

His [00:07:00] execution. Actually, I think it's, he's brave and committed to what he was doing, but I know who I am and how I would probably have navigated that again, assuming I were in similar shoes and where I saw his ambition for like rolling, like building, developing his equity company fairly quickly off the bat of what was a really good first year.

And again, I mean, that's awesome to have an inspirational first year. And it's like, you feel like you've got tailwinds. You know, you're like, okay, this, this momentum, let's ride this and let's grow probably to what his end game sounds like wants to be in this larger, you know, kind of mini Berkshires. We always hear the industry or what have you.

I would love to execute something like that myself. Quite honestly, I think knowing me, I probably. Because I'm so risk averse when it comes to that, I probably would have stored a few years of stable revenue [00:08:00] or profit and kind of banked it had more cash, stronger cash position before deploying it and sending it out the door to grow as quickly as he did.

Um, that's probably 1 of the big ones where, where I would I differ and I just, I know I feel confident in saying this because I know how I handle my personal finances and I'm very. Similar minded like, you know, so I don't every dollar has to have a very specific purpose. And my 1st position is always hedging against downside.

So I like to have buffer before deploying, you know, anything above and beyond, which I'll do for an investment, but, um, always make sure my house is well protected, so to speak. So I think that was a big, for me, that was a big difference. Again, inspirational. I loved what he was doing. I love the ambition and like the vision for that future growth.

I'm not sure. Knowing myself, I would have probably. Gotten as aggressive as early as he did with that. 

**Athena:** Yeah, I agree. It's one of the main reasons why I kind of, [00:09:00] and you all should know this about me. I really like Warren off thinking about a roll up strategy before you've stabilized business number 1, right?

And really have your head wrapped around that 1. So the, because things were going well. And he won't mind me saying this, so I think you could, and he wouldn't mind us speaking candidly about what we saw either. Um, but also didn't want to pick on him in the moment. Right? But the, the buying a whole new fleet of vehicles within the 1st, couple of months, the doing the whole rebrand within the 1st, couple of months, even things that weren't even related specifically to the private equity play the huge changes, capital expenditures and investments into the business.

Early on, when things were good, it's like that also can have an impact when he doesn't even understand that it's an annual cycle rather than a monthly one in terms of seasonality. Right? So, it's why the J curve is [00:10:00] something really important to pay attention to. It's like, you have a down in year 1 and year 2, and then it goes back up after you reinvest and kind of get your feet under you.

But people make the assumption of your one goes well. Year 2 is going to be even better, you know, where it might just catch up to you after a year owning that business. So that's why the 2 years of really focusing on stabilizing, understanding, learning everything about it. Because, you know, can you truly fully understand a business before you've been through an annual cycle with it?

**Justin:** It is, uh, exactly. And it's hard to predict macroeconomic factors like the entire industry. Taking what was it like a 30 percent hit across the board. And I think from where I sit, I mean, I, I have been investing in real estate for a long time and I was very aggressively developing and investing throughout 2008.

And so I've lived in this macroeconomic situation that completely derailed everything. I thought we were doing along with a lot [00:11:00] of my colleagues and networks who were doing similar things. So, I guess, because of that, it's like, you just never know. You don't know where. Things are going to go south. So, you know, I operate from a place of just take, you know, take care of yourself and your house, keep it in order and cash away and, you know, remain liquid enough to cover some serious downside and then anything above and beyond, you know, a reasonable amount of.

Um, health in that respect and sure, like, go in when, you know, you've got that built. Uh, and then you're not kind of over leveraging, but that's that's my take. 

**Athena:** Yeah, good, good take and I would agree with a lot of what you said. Uh, another thing to know when you do 100 percent seller financing deal. They don't there's no line of credit built in, you know, so, like, all of you are going to be using SBA for the most part.

And when you do SBA, you can also and should. Get that line of credit agreed before there's ink on the paper so that it's [00:12:00] available to you should you need it. Now, we're not just took over the business as is. I don't even know if they properly. Calculated like, A. R. E. A. P. working capital. I know for a fact he didn't he didn't know what maintenance CapEx was because we were talking about it when I was learning about it a couple years ago.

And he's like, wow, we didn't even think about that. Luckily. It wasn't an issue. Um, you know, so, uh, like, also, when you use SBA, like, yes, 100 percent seller financing can be attractive in a lot of ways. And he had such a good relationship that the owner was putting money. Back into his business, which is phenomenal.

Um, but, you know, the, the working the, the line of credit and the potential additional working capital that you can have access to when you take over a business. When using an SBA lender is something that he didn't have. So it was like, he had what he had coming into the bank account and that was it. Um, no additional access to capital.

And then when he actually needed it by [00:13:00] then, you know, the writing was on the wall with where the revenue and margins were going and stuff like that. So, um, you know, it's also something to to bear in mind the difference between 100 percent seller financing and. You know, using SBA and structuring it in a way that you can protect yourself in those situations with with as much working capital and line of credit and additional sources that you can pull down.

Should you need it? Um, cool. Thanks. Thanks for your thoughts. Justin. Um, anyone else? Like, what was your takeaways or thoughts or even questions that might have come up as you were listening to him? Um, I was actually hanging out with Lindsay and Kevin, uh, over the weekend and Lindsay's like, yeah, there was this 1 area I wanted to double click on, you know, so was there any of those that that came up or other concerns, questions, thoughts, takeaways.[00:14:00] 

Anyone on our team want to answer to and we had lengthy discussions about this as a team. 

**Ryan:** Yeah, I mean, I'll just say just, um, you know, no business is just straight up into the right. When you take it over, like, if you look at. The last 3 years financials, or sometimes if you can't even more there's volatile volatile periods.

Um, and then, so that's just like life, like the bad times don't last forever and neither do the good times. And that's just how the businesses, if you look at the financials, that's they do the same thing. Um, and you can't prepare for all of these. Situations like no matter how great your APA is or your LOI, you know, or your structuring, there are, there's a certain amount of this.

That's just, um, you have to like [00:15:00] be ready to take on whatever, uh, as, and his was just, I would say an extreme example that was a very extreme case. And I was like, wow, I was glued to the screen listening to what he was saying. Um, so I just think that like. 1 thing I take away and I just continue to look at is just like, stay humble with your projections when you're looking at things like, when you're looking at the 1st, couple of years, just like, what if I just do nothing positive?

What if I just my only objective is just to keep doing what he's doing. And if I do that, you know, what's kind of the worst that would happen in the last 3 years? And am I ready for that? Um, so that's pretty much my main takeaway is. It's just stay humble. I honestly, I think Justin touched on a lot of things that, uh, I think is important.

It's just you come in that 1st year [00:16:00] and just try to learn as much as you can about the business. The people as well 1 day and I don't want to say anything or about or anything. But another part is, is. He was talking about he had to let someone go because they didn't want to be part of this new process improvement, but who knows what value that guy's added over the years.

Um, maybe just don't make so many changes that he's uncomfortable with, and just kind of sit with it for a while to see if maybe there's something that you're not getting from him and then make the, and then maybe you build that relationship with him and then you make those changes in the future and he's more on board because he, he's, he sees your vision.

He feels you instead of making all these changes immediately. Your top guy getting scared and leaving the business. So, um, yeah, I really just like, if you talk with the seller and you think they're doing a pretty good job and the financials are pretty good. Be humble. I'll come in there and just learn from you.

You know, if you're not a plumber, [00:17:00] don't pretend like, you're going to come in and be an excellent plumber just literally acknowledge it on the calls with the seller. I'm not a plumber. So I'm a little bit worried about that, but. I'd love to just train with you and get to speed on that. How long do you think it would take you to teach me to be a decent plumber have an idea of what's going on.

And most of these sellers will be very open to that and say, hey, I can, I can train you in this time or don't worry about that. This is I can, I can help you with that. So, um, yeah, uh, those are my thoughts. I thought it was, it was a great call. 

**Athena:** Yeah, but behind the scenes with Renan and all of his endeavors are pretty phenomenal experiences.

Um, I, I'm writing down notes in my head of things. I wanted to, like, kind of pull out as learnings and observations, um, on his story specifically, but something to just, like, put a. Preview or, or excitement in terms of [00:18:00] the call that we're going to have on Thursday with Nash. Um, he took over, he did a 6 million dollar deal.

Uh, it was 1. 5 in, uh, earnings. So, and he got a 2x on it. It was an, uh, transmission auto repair business. And he also bought the real estate value at about 3 million. So he did a lot in terms of, like, structuring, para pursue, and the whole thing. But one thing that I think is phenomenal. About what he's done in the 1st year plus transition was really focusing on culture and people, you know, and so he's going to talk a lot about that on Thursday, mostly because I'll be asking him questions about it.

And I think the way that he's approached it has been, um, unbelievable, but he doesn't do any of the tooling himself. Like he's managing. You know, all the guys that are doing all that and had some interesting legacy folks that had been there for a really long time. How long it took him to start implementing those changes in terms of, like, making the [00:19:00] culture his own versus leaving the legacy culture of the owner in place and how he thought about that meticulously.

So we'll be able to pull some of that out because I think that was a learning with. Uh, how Renan took over this business, you know, it was like such a focus on getting the deal done and starting that there was kind of a, you know, not a conversation and not a plan around. How are we notifying all these people working here?

This is happening. You know, like, employees were just turning up in the office and new owners sitting there asking for social security numbers and they're like, who the hell are you? You know, no. Um, so I can imagine that that had a, uh, you know, pretty big impact, but as, as you've seen, Renan is so personable.

It sounded like he was able to get him back, a lot of him back. But, you know, what we hear in the transition story is like he losing key employees and losing people early on can [00:20:00] have a real impact on the business if they're not bought in. To the process and you and the culture and the vision of where it's going to be.

So, if, if, uh, I mean, I remember Nash talking about practicing and planning his, like, first day speech, you know, and talking about it with the owner and, like, his plans and how he was getting them bought in. So he really went about it from a people first standpoint, which I think a lot of us resonate with.

Um, Not that Renan doesn't care about his people, and he does. He's selfless and has a huge heart, but just the, the strategy in which we're taking over businesses and what we're doing with them is important. Um, you know, it's something else that I, I was concerned about for him was changing the brand so early on.

I think it was within months of taking over the business. He was rebranding that whole business, you know, before really fully understanding it. So everybody Kind of has a story of taking over something and unless they're [00:21:00] being very strict to themselves about not changing anything. And that 1st, you know, I mean, they say 90 days, but I feel like that isn't even enough.

Really? Like, it's like, you change the absolutely necessary things. Like, you know, you're going to have to set up bank accounts and have things go to different places and maybe set up a payment processor or, you know, um, Get the books digitized or something, but there's story after story after story of a new owner going in and being like, this old fax machine system is outdated.

Let me update it before fully understanding the purpose of that fax machine. And then they realize, oh, my God, that's where all our orders came from. And I got rid of the fax machine. And now I have no orders and my revenue is affected. You know, we hear those kinds of stories. So. The importance and why we heart about about, like, really not changing anything, at least in the first 90 days, if not 60 days, if not 100 percent absolutely necessary to carry on the [00:22:00] business, but that can be really hard because you get really excited about all the changes you want to make and all the things that you want to do.

Um, and to Justin's point, I think extending the timeline in your mind. Of the changes, right? Like, when am I allowed to start making changes that are not absolutely necessary to continue business, right? Setting up the big accounts, oftentimes in an asset sale, you have to, right? Um, but something that I recommend people do is.

Like, you know, the first 90 days, you're just literally shadowing the owner. You're trying to extract as much 90 or as much information as you can out of their head onto paper onto an S. O. P. So you just like, view yourself as like, I am the S. O. P. maker. Right? I am creating the standard operating procedures from this business.

And I'm going to follow around the owner until I know how to operate this business without him here. That is our job when we're going in there and winning over the employees, getting them bought into [00:23:00] like who we are, et cetera, et cetera. But I hear people say sometimes, like, I'm going to go in and give them a raise on day 1.

I'm like, but. Hey, do we know that I can actually like, stand up with that? Like, is that, you know, if we're going to potentially lose someone, maybe, but making plans before you've actually gotten in there and understand how everything works. So, but it can be hard because we're seeing all these things that start driving us crazy.

Like, how are they operating in this way? So, the best thing that that I recommend for people to do is just keep a long list. So, like, brain dump all the things that you want to change. Right. And just keep writing it down, keep writing it down, keep writing it down. So, you know, that you're capturing it somewhere.

And then when you have a date in the future, which you've agreed, I'm not allowed to make changes until this date. And I've done the budgets. I've had conversations. I've chosen the priority of those things that I want to change. And in what order, you know, maybe we even want to start implementing a VTO type strategy.

[00:24:00] We do that in our business. Like what's the quarterly goals. And issues that we as an entire business are implementing or facing or, you know, paying attention to. So then it's like, if your quarterly milestones and the things you're allowed to change in that quarter that you've thought through and looked at the budget, um, Jason asks.

What's a VTO? That's an excellent question. Um, so there is a book called Traction, and it's written by a chap called Gino Wickman, and he created the Entrepreneurial Operating System. So this is a small business framework that Gino created, which is one of the best, I think, out there, and there's actual people that you can hire.

That will come into your business and implement this whole EOS system, or you can do it yourself and just read this book and learn about it. Um, there's a lot of different elements to it, but one of the main ones that I take away [00:25:00] and something that I would, uh, when I was business consulting, something that I would have my business, uh, consulting clients look at was right fit, right seat.

So there's a way in which you can kind of audit everybody on your team. Against your values, your culture, and whether they're in the right seat. So is this the right person for this business? So they have the right values, the right attitude, everything. And are they doing the right job? Are they qualified or appropriate for the job that we have them doing?

So there's this whole auditing system where you're kind of rating. Everybody on your team. So you'll probably want to do something like that when you go into a business and just start observing and seeing. Um, and then the VTO is called vision slash traction organizer and it's a 2 page business plan and it takes a ton of work to get to that point.

So the book kind of details all the sessions and strategy sessions that you can do. But then you just basically have this 2 page. Business plan that [00:26:00] everybody in the company has access to. It has your core values. It has your marketing statement. It has your 10 year goal. It has, um, your marketing strategy in there.

It has your 3 year goal, your 1 year goal and your quarterly goals as well as the list of issues that you're going to attack in that quarter. So everybody sees the road map and everybody on this team has seen our video. We go through every quarter. We look at what we achieved for the last quarter, talk about, you know, what, what happened, what, what didn't, what do we need to continue it in the next quarter and then that way everybody's really clear and bought into the vision and where you're going, but also it creates autonomy because if somebody wants to start a side project, it's like, well, if it's not in the quarterly goals that we've all agreed that we're doing, then we can kind of put that to one side.

So does that answer your question? Jason? It's a phenomenal way to kind of. Okay. I think for the most part, like, you know, for me, [00:27:00] especially it helps me from getting like my eyes too big and wanting to do too many things all at once. Cause like, you always have things that you want to do as a business owner.

There's always things that you can, um, pay attention to or change, but you can't do everything all at once. And if you try to do everything all at once, you're going to do a bunch of things badly instead of doing a few things. Well, um, so, um, I think it's Dan Martell that talks about the difference between dumpster fires and house fires, right?

Like, a dumpster fire is kind of outside, but it's not going to burn the house down, whereas like a kitchen fire, like, that, that can burn your house down. So that's the thing that you kind of give your energy and attention to first. Um, so. Like in Renan's example, I suppose the, the brand wasn't, wasn't a kitchen fire.

That was like, it was something that was nice to have, but probably not something to focus on the first couple of months because it's a lot of money and then has that [00:28:00] risk of people not knowing who they are and losing customers and that sort of thing. So, um, okay. I've been hogging the mic. Any other thoughts, questions, takeaways from And, and, and the things that he shared.

Were we feeling excited? Did it like, make us question our whole life? And if we actually have it in us to go through with this, how are we feeling? Polly, I see you smiling. How did you feel after that?

**Polly:** I um, I thought it was, I again thought it was really brave for him to come forward with everything and be so transparent. I guess the advantage that I feel I personally have had working with small businesses, especially the, the guy that I worked with for 15 years. He's actually a personal friend of mine who started the business and brought me in and I was his 2nd employee next to the project manager.

That was just doing all of the [00:29:00] project. You know, um. Project installations and all that kind of thing. And he brought me in sales and we just that whole business kept evolving for all of those years. And, you know, there were some really, really rough times during 2008 2009, even into 2010. there were some really rough times and staff got cut and all of that.

So, um, you know, I definitely think there's always volatility and. And I, I think that, you know, it's a good point taken about just leaving everything status quo for a while for a good while, because. Even with having, like, there was a, I'm using a past experience in the business. I just was telling you about, um, we always had outsourced.

I, you know, all of the, the bookkeeping and that kind of thing. Uh, this gentleman was a CPA. I remember him coming in and just, he was just a [00:30:00] very kind of loud, boisterous type of person came in and said, okay, you need to change this, this, this, this and this that we're just like. Especially the owner of the business, John, he was like, oh, my gosh, you know, just hold on a 2nd, you know, and to your point, you know, he should have been sitting in the business to learn the business for a little while, even from from the standpoint of, yeah, there were changes that needed to be made, but.

Not not immediately, it wasn't like a poorly operated business from the financial piece. It was just, I think it was more about the way he wanted to see things done. So he didn't end up staying on and we, we got somebody else. But, um, yeah, the sitting in the business, I think is really important. Just taking it all in learning, um.

You know, just not getting to not getting too anxious to make changes in the beginning, or even in the middle. I mean, I don't know what your timeframe is. Look what you're talking about. But are you talking like more. Around a [00:31:00] year of just kind of seeing how things go, or maybe just depending on the business itself.

**Athena:** It'll depend on the business. I think 1st, 90 days is is, like, the minimum, right? You don't want to make any changes whatsoever. And like I said. Really, that first couple of months is you like, not leaving the owner alone and trying to get as much out of their head, right? Like, they have likely not documented anything.

So, like, being chief SOP collector and just following them around and getting everything and getting access to everything and how do you do these things and. You know, conversations with the clients and you just want to insert yourself and basically be their shadow and until you feel confident, like, I could do this without them without changing anything.

We don't need to change anything when we bought when we buy the business, because it was working. If we did our due diligence correctly, it was working to a point. Obviously, there's ways that we can make it better, but, like, depending on the business [00:32:00] and what state it's in, there are things that you might want to change, you know, like, um.

I imagine Jason's Skylight manufacturing business, where they're doing paper tickets, it's probably going to drive him crazy to watch them do that for the 1st, couple of months. Right? But until he understands exactly how that paper system works, we can't really implement a tech system. So, like, once he feels he can run the paper system himself, then.

We can apply the tech and when we have a like, okay, this is what it's actually going to do. And this is our strategy and our plan to make sure that 1 workflow isn't interrupted while we do the 2nd workflow. But I think we've all been there on teams where a new person is hired or a consultant comes in or like your experience, right?

It's like someone comes in and they think they know everything before understanding everything. And then they want to make all these changes and like that in itself can ruffle feathers. With the team or [00:33:00] customers or whatever, people don't like change, you know, so, like, if they see coming in and wanting to, like, rip everything up, not only do they not like change, but a lot of people can can take it as a reflection of them doing things.

Wrong, or you don't like how they've done things and feel demotivated by that too. 

**Polly:** Right? Yeah, I, I definitely agree. So just, I actually made a note of that. It's just like, really taking the time to sit in the business and when you're entrenched in it yourself, you know, at. And like, to your point, you know, somebody comes in and they just stir like a whirlwind, like the Tasmanian devil blowing through there, then immediately it demotivates people, makes people very anxious and like, oh, my gosh, this new this person now, this wasn't an owner, obviously, what I use as an example, but this person is going to change this and that, you know, it's.

It's very disconcerting to a lot of people. So, or to the, to the team, [00:34:00] even to the owner, even though that owner sold the business. I mean, if they're staying on for transitionary time, I mean, it can cause friction between the new owner and the existing or the new owner. And I wouldn't want to say existing owner, but the new owner, and now the company is a past owner.

And so it's just, it's not good all around. Just just. Just taking it all in and learning as much as you possibly can in the beginning is the most important. So, 

**Athena:** yeah, and 1 thing that you can do to build goodwill and goodwill and relationships with the employees is, like, in that 1st, 90 days, like, really sitting down with each of them understanding how they work.

Right? And, like, they might have a bunch of ideas for changes that they wanted or things that would make their life easier. But the owner didn't want to do it because they didn't want to. Right? They didn't want to change anything. Right? So, like, oftentimes you'll find a bunch of employees with a great ideas and [00:35:00] frustrations that things are running, like, in a way that wasn't really helping them, but the exiting under didn't want to do anything.

So, then, when you're sitting with everyone and getting to know them and getting to know their workflows and like, hey, what ideas do you have for making things better around here? And you just want to manage expectations with that. Like I can't promise that I'm going to make all the changes, but I want to hear you and I want to make things like, I want to make your life easier.

I want to make this better. So, um, I think that's one of the nice things about using something like a VTO because, um, you basically ask, you, you create a culture of like, if you see an issue in this business, I want you to raise it, you know? So it's like, we don't complain about issues. We bring them somewhere.

So that we know that there's an issue there and then it gets prioritized and worked on like as a business decision. So rather than having people going around and being like, this thing over here is always broken. It's like, here's where you go when you see an issue, you're [00:36:00] going to log it and then every quarter we're going to like, review all of the issues and decide which ones that we as a company are going to address.

You know, and so when they see their issue get addressed or, you know, they see that things are actually like it's going somewhere. It's being listened to and considered that can create goodwill. And, um, I know Nash is going to talk about that next week too. Like some of the things that the guys wanted that, that would, you know, he just did some small improvements and things and, you know, You know, even talked about that with, uh, you know, talking to his team, like, what software is the best one got them all involved in finding the solution and doing the research.

And then they put in a solution in place that, like, got rid of all the crazy folders that were hanging around the office. And, you know, that probably, as a result, got them paid a lot quicker because they have to do insurance. Claims and stuff like that with restoration. So, um, you know, the, the changes can also be a way to, like, bring the team in and then have [00:37:00] them feel heard.

Even if they know that their thing is not going to get addressed. It's like, they know that it's, it's gone somewhere and it's being reviewed and it's being considered and then everybody gets to know what, what things you're going to focus on, like, what changes are going to be made. So they feel involved in the process, which is less scary to.

But I imagine, Polly, from you being involved in, like, being employee number two, that you also know the resiliency that must come with, you know, the volatility of a small business and just having to, like, get up and, like, keep doing things, right? 

**Polly:** Yep, definitely. And wearing different hats and Listening, you know, to people be ecstatically happy and then very frustrated and, you know, and, and the owner, the owner of the business that I worked for for so long, he is a great person, but he's very non confrontational.

A lot of the times [00:38:00] conversations that had to be had or ended up being me.

So he had great ideas. He was a great visionary. He wasn't the best communicator when it came to something that could potentially be a conflict. So that's something. Okay. 

**Athena:** So, and yet another skill that Polly has been, uh, keeping, keeping under wraps is, uh, we'll have the tough conversations when necessary.

**Polly:** Chief mediator. 

**Athena:** I love it. Well, thanks, Polly. Um, appreciate your thoughts there. Anyone else? I had a few folks. I wanted to kind of check in on with the deals that they're working on right now, but any other. Thoughts from anyone on the team or anyone else, uh, out there about Renan's story. I had a few more things I was just going to point out that I think are useful for us to consider.

Okay, cool. Um, [00:39:00] so something that I think is worth pointing out. Uh, is the idea of putting an operator in place and being able to remove yourself from the business. So, um, year 2 didn't go well after Renan was absent in year 1, right? So things were going, going, going, but then year 2 wasn't good. And then he himself had to get back involved so much more than he did before.

So it's. Yes, it's, it's an annual cyclical thing, but actually I had a client working on a restoration business in California that was just like gangbusters growth. So maybe it was like New Jersey cyclical thing. I don't know. But also something to bear in mind is like, we can't just put our livelihood in the hands of somebody else.

That early on, right until we really fully understand the business. So, being involved and being okay with, like, being in that business day to day, it [00:40:00] takes time to stabilize it and get it to a point where you could potentially remove yourself. Um, and, you know, resiliency is something I admire about him the most, you know, he takes.

Such big swings bigger than any of us would ever consider doing that. It inspires us to go a little bit bigger than we might have ourselves. And that certainly happened for me. And, you know, I know he inspires people all over the place with, with just these things that he's just willing to do right. And, and try out and people are like, that's crazy.

But like. No, you got to be a little bit crazy to be a business owner and to try things and to go out and do things on your own and be responsible for things. So, um, you know, we don't all have to go to that level. And that, you know, he's got a huge grand ambition and it's very inspiring. But also the takeaway that I, I want to land with you.

And this is [00:41:00] something, you know, I've been working with people thinking about starting a business, you know, For over a decade, and they would always get so scared about quitting their job and going all in in their business. And it's kind of the same thing in here. Like, literally the worst case scenario that ran on ended up with was that he had to go back to his W2.

Right? So we can get. So scared in these situations, but we've now heard from Mike and Renan, you can negotiate the payment so you can find ways around it if you're willing to have the difficult conversations like Polly is right. It's like, hey, uh, cash flow is tight this month. Who do we need to talk to about this and see if we can get extended payment terms or negotiate things there or get an extra line of credit or whatever?

All right. And also, then the next worst case scenario is that you have to get a job, which we've all had before and actually like, okay, and I haven't had anybody come on and talk about [00:42:00] bankruptcy and it's horrible. Right? And that's. But a lot of people that I talked to that have been through bankruptcy before, like it sounds a lot worse than it actually is.

Not that I'm advocating for that. I don't want anybody to go through that. That's why we're here and try to advise people. But I guess it's kind of the whole like in the worst case scenario that you weren't able to get line of credit, get in there and get some sales and do everything you can or negotiate.

Some, you know, um, uh, not forgiveness, but, uh, I forget the phrase, but the bank will sometimes give you some reprieve on your payments for a couple months while you catch back up. And, you know, so be willing to have those kinds of conversations and get used to having uncomfortable conversations, maybe early on and just challenge yourself once a week to go have an uncomfortable conversation about something.

If that's something you don't like doing and, um, you know, I'm like. Certainly, uh, uh, confrontation. Um, [00:43:00] I don't like confrontation in certain scenarios. So I really had to push myself to have these conversations, but I realized the more uncomfortable conversations that I had, the better the outcome overall.

So I trained myself that actually having the initially uncomfortable conversation makes things better long term. Um, but, you know, worst case scenario is, is there's a W2. Waiting for you. All of you had one before and you can go get another one. So I know that's not the ideal. And it was really kind of beautiful to hear written on saying, like, you know, I have my happily ever after.

And you're like, what? Like, okay, like, he's super happy. He's got his W2. His needs are met. He's running this business. He's able to do everything and he has that security. So while it's not the ideal and what all of us are not wanting, you know, to happen. Yeah. There's still, you know, a light at the end of the tunnel there.

I caught up with him on Saturday too. And, um, he's, he sent me a picture and he'd gotten his black belt in Brazilian jiu [00:44:00] jitsu, which. Like, Ryan's shaking his head. Ryan, can you explain how hard that is to get? Because I will butcher the explanation, but it's, it's a pretty big, like, 

**Ryan:** minimum of 10 years, 5 days a week.

That's the minimum, 

**Athena:** right? But even then it's not guaranteed, right? Like, there's. Competency and somebody feeling like you're ready for it and stuff. So it can take a really long time to get it even after 10 years. 

**Ryan:** Yeah. Then you have to, it's more of a lifestyle acknowledgement from someone who's done it longer than you, that you have to kind of earn that respect from somebody else.

It's not just given, yeah, you did 10 years, five times. It's like someone who's like a master has to acknowledge that and give that to you. It's a, it's a big deal. 

**Athena:** Yeah. So Renan was like, he was over the moon, super excited about getting his black belt. But also he was saying, you know what, Athena, I think, I think he said it took him 19 years to get his [00:45:00] black belt.

And he was like, and I was waiting. I was like, when is it coming? When is it coming? When is it coming? And he's like, you know, and I was freaking out about getting funding and being able to start my, you know, mini Berkshire Hathaway, whatever my PE fund. And I was like, when is it happening? When is it happening?

And when I, like, released it, it's like, the funding's coming. He's like, so it's not that you can't get the things that you want. But you need to extend your timeline and you need to put in the work and just keep putting in the work consistently to get the thing that you want. So a lot of us have unreasonably short timelines for getting the things that we want to do.

And most people give up right before they get the thing that they wanted all along. You know, so as long as we keep going after things and then. We're going to be extending our timeline and oftentimes that can be a little trick that we can do for ourselves. If we like, multiply the time we want something much longer than we ended up getting it sooner and we're happy about that, as opposed to giving ourselves unreasonable expectations about when we're going to acquire a business.[00:46:00] 

Renan and I laugh that business buying community that we joined years ago, you know, the thing was like, okay, month one, take the course month to find a business month three close, you know, and then it was like three months in and we're all like, why haven't we closed on a business yet? There's something wrong with us.

Now I'm like, that is so irresponsible to teach people that like, it's not there's no sense of reality where that is a thing unless you're buying like, you know, how you can't even learn enough about how to do it. On your own also. So anyways, I, I thought I would just full circle the, the nugget that Renan left me with is like, you know, it's not that you can't get it, it's just that you need to extend your timeline and you need to keep picking yourself up and going after those things.

So, um, yeah, I'm so glad, uh, that all of you were able to join that and listen in on it. I hope that stuff, uh, is useful for you. Um, you know, Nash is gonna come. On [00:47:00] Thursday, and he, like I said, has a phenomenal approach to culture and very methodical and very planned in the things that he does in the way he does things.

And even with that, he's had some nail biting moments over the last year and a half that are just, oh, my God, you know, like, how do you get through that? But also some of the like, best. One liners I've ever heard about the lifestyle that doing this has been able to afford him. So, um, but before we wrap up, uh, Joe, I was wondering if you're still here.

**Joe:** Yes, I am 

**Athena:** amazing. So, uh, you've got some news, some new developments. How are you feeling about those? 

**Joe:** Uh, pretty good. So, on the 1st, I with the company, I just got all the financials. Uh, [00:48:00] so those are up to a couple of lenders just to kind of start the process there, nothing majorly changed there and I have a weekly call with the seller and then yesterday I just put in an LOI for the playground and safety flooring company and been in communication with the broker, he acknowledged the receipt.

Sent back a message trying to pull the broker stuff saying, uh, multiple offers, that sort of thing. So 

**Athena:** I think I have a pretty 

**Joe:** strong offer right out the gate. 

**Athena:** Okay. Amazing. I was going to say, what's your feelings on competition? Cause they came, they went off the market and then it came back and they came, you know, they wanted, wanted to talk to you.

So it sounded like you were front runner there. You've had a couple of seller meetings. How are you feeling about that one? 

**Joe:** Uh, good as long as and depending, you know, on the bluff, if there are other offers and where they may be landing. But I think it was important that I met with the, uh, two of two of the sellers, two of the owners.

One of them I met twice. [00:49:00] Um, yeah, it was good. So I'm feeling good about it. Like I said, you just sometimes you wonder if. What competitive vids might be, I can't worry about too much. And then also if they can pull through or not. So, I'm just kind of playing my game at this moment, at the moment. But, having two LOIs is pretty fun.

**Athena:** Yeah, I was gonna, I was gonna ask you. I mean, A, that's awesome. We'll see if we, uh, get the second one signed. Uh, let's assume you get the second one signed. Where's your, where are you leaning in terms of the two deals? 

**Joe:** I'll worry about it when the numbers kind of come through. Um, the AC company already, the numbers already, again, lower than what were projected on the PNL.

Yeah, I have a feeling it's not going to get funded at the, uh, at that number he's looking for, but, uh, I'll try to keep that open mind. So, and, and in seeing that as an example that the numbers are never seemingly what they give us, you know, what's going to happen with the [00:50:00] playground company. 

**Athena:** So I was 

**Joe:** worried, I'm just focused on getting them under LOI and, uh, trusting the process.

**Athena:** Amazing. Um, cool. Well, anything we can help you on there? You're just kind of in a wait and hear mode right now on both of those. 

**Joe:** Yeah, it's a wait mode. I'm going to be bringing up a couple of lenders tomorrow or Thursday. Just on the initial, uh. Things they may have on the AC company and I need to figure out my next move with the, uh, the playground company, but it's, you know, right now they have several days to kind of sign us, put a one week expiration on the letter.

**Athena:** Nice work. All right. Well, way to go Joe, getting a couple out there and hedging your bets too and getting some options. So that's exciting. 

**Joe:** Yeah, thank you. 

**Athena:** Awesome. Um, Jason, I saw you were here, too. I don't know if you're still on. Um, you're kind of at a standstill and had some ideas on [00:51:00] strategy next. I don't know if you wanted to chat through that if you're still here.

I didn't see your camera on, so you might be. There you are. 

**Jason:** I'm still here. Sorry, I got it. I got a puppy, so. 

**Athena:** Oh, my god, a cutie. He 

**Jason:** just peed on the floor, so my wife's losing it, so I gotta, I'm outside. 

**Athena:** Well, if it's a bad time to chat through your deals, 

**Jason:** hang out with the 

**Athena:** puppy. How are you feeling about things?

**Jason:** Uh, you know, I feel like we have one last ditch effort on the skylights. So we got one more banker that maybe wants to work with us. Okay. I've also reached out to, um, Pioneer capital to see if the 2 bankers they had might be interested. Uh, so I'm waiting to hear back on them and then we've got a mean schedule already.

So I actually drafted up a little email to send to the skylight seller next week to say, like, hey, you still interested? [00:52:00] There could be a potential win win here with the financials you have right now. And, uh, the other one is the, um, office suite, uh, which the broker just doesn't seem to be on his game. Uh, so I, I found some issues with the SIM where they're saying all the money's coming through the, uh, virtual assistant and not much, much of it's come through the real estate, but it's actually turned around.

Most of the money's coming through the real estate. Not a lot's coming through the virtual assistant. And then I found some, I talked to Ryan about this. I found some issues with the salary, the salary numbers were way off, like 40, 50, 000. So we've had some meetings to say, like, hey, we want to get this as close as possible because we don't want to go into earnings and then you're going to get disappointed with the offer because it's going to have to change based off of S.

D. E. So they actually just [00:53:00] got back to me today. Uh, with the information. So I'm going to start crunching some numbers again, take a look at it. 

**Athena:** Yeah. But I mean, even still, it's got to feel good to kind of get some experience that you're talking about this kind of stuff with a lot of confidence. Right. So it's like, it's a good learning experience to kind of catch those sorts of things, talk them through, have the conversation, see if you can get some clarity.

**Jason:** Oh yeah. I feel like I went through the valley of shadow of the death when the skylight company, it was. It was tough. Uh, it was, uh, it, it was, uh, it was emotional. I was, uh, kicking pebbles around my house at saw myself in this business. And then it kind of collapsed and I was trying to hold on for dear life.

And it didn't seem like the seller wanted to make it happen. And, um, no, I know it was just, um, it was a bit of, it's been, you know, you always try to prepare yourself for the emotional rollercoaster. And then it happens. You're like, man, I didn't know it was going to be like [00:54:00] this. Uh, so that's kind of the way it's been.

Uh, but try to pick myself up. You know, I, well, I really like the skylight business is the SDE where it's like, I can see myself in this business and I could quit my job. Whereas like the other stuff, it's like, like, it's not enough. I always call it velocity to get out of the gravitational pull of the rat race.

It's like, The office suite is just, it's just not enough to pull me out. It's getting me there, but it's like, I feel like I got a couple of shots with like SBA, like I can do one, my wife can do one, but it's like, like one or the other, it's gotta be like a, like a, not a, just a base hit, like I need a home run.

**Athena:** Yeah, especially if it sounds like it's actually more of a real estate play than a business play. So, 

**Jason:** yes, 

**Athena:** um, I do know that the, you know, virtual when you say virtual assistant, is it like virtual office support and stuff that they're doing? Yeah, [00:55:00] yeah. 

**Jason:** So, like, um, some of the good stuff that I saw with this business, like, in the state of Georgia, if you're like an auto broker, you have to have.

An office. So like stuff like that. It's like they have a lot of auto brokers, right? They don't even go there, right? But they're just charging them 600 bucks a month for this office space. I was like, oh, this that's a great idea. And one of them is in the city of Atlanta. It's kind of not officially, I would say, but you know, that's mailing addresses city of Atlanta.

So it's like sought after. So I think there's some opportunities there, but I just. It's not the same as a skylight where it's like, oh, there's a lot of growth potential here. Like this other one. I don't like it can make you a steady cash flow, but there's not a lot of potential like to X the business.

**Athena:** Yeah, it's good to though to have like a couple in hand for you to compare to. [00:56:00] Oh, Clarity exercise that you need him to go through. Yeah. 

**Jason:** I, uh, you know, I tried to leave it on a good note. Uh, I think I told Ryan, like I brought over some gifts. I was like, Hey, here's how you back up your heart computer. I'll do it before I leave.

You know, if, if you ever are looking to sell, you know, I'm always available. If you've got computer problems, like I I'm your tech guy, right. It's like, just call me up. I can help you. Um, so yeah, I tried to leave as good a terms as possible. 

**Athena:** Excellent. Okay. Well, anything we can help you with? Are you clear where you're moving forward?

**Jason:** Uh, just, you know, trying to try to move forward and keep the motivation and the momentum going. Like, I, I always worry about momentum in these situations where it's like, Oh, I had all this momentum. And then it's like, we lost everything. We lost everything. And like all the inertia and everything is kind of completely gone.

So it's like, that's why I'm pursuing this, this office thing. It's like, it's [00:57:00] Better than nothing. 

**Athena:** Yeah. Um, and there'll be more to I think with the off market off market conversations just take longer. You know, it's like, you gotta, you gotta warm them up and get them ready for what's ahead. And there's going to be even more than he needs to do once the bank starts getting involved in the QV involved and that sort of thing.

So. Um, that was actually another takeaway from a non story, like how much time he spent with people before he got it to an ally. Um, and we're like, we want a business now, let's let's rush to the ally. But I really liked. And Renan's already agreed. I asked him on Saturday if he'll come back and do like a session with us on like actually just focusing on building that relationship, building a rapport, that kind of sales strategy that he goes through.

But the thing he said that he kind of glossed over is like, when I turn up at a business and they're like, how much do you want to offer? And he's like, whoa, whoa, whoa. I want to buy a business. I don't know if I want to buy your business. So 1st, I need to [00:58:00] like, understand it. Right? So you're like, taking away from them and not sense and being like, and it's kind of like, okay, like, if you want to get married, it's like, there's a bunch of people, you know, out there today.

Like, you're not just going to go for the 1st. It's like, I need to decide if you're somebody I actually want to get married to, you know, like, we need to. Yeah. Court each other and I need to understand you a little bit more and see if you're like, nice, the waitstaff and whatever. Um, so, you know, again, that that timeline extension, but also building that relationship over time off market can be really great opportunities, but they're not necessarily in that I need to celebrate the second like they would be having gone through the broker built that relationship for a couple months, who knows how long before they actually listed it, you know?

**Jason:** Yeah, I will say. Like off market is like the school of hard knocks. It's like, Oh, you want to learn how to buy a business? Like try off market. Like you're going to learn everything.

**Athena:** I do try to warn people about that. I'm like, you need us to help you through [00:59:00] it. You know, it's not, you don't want to do this alone. This is, this is a lot of work. 

**Jason:** Yeah. I think, you know, you go into this biz buying journey, people are like, Oh, off market's the best place to get deals. And it's like, it might be.

But you're gonna put in, like, six times the effort, right? Because, like, you're being a teacher, you're trying to negotiate at the same time. You try to treat them fairly, uh, you know, you try to, to me, understand the process of like cashflow and working capital and quality of earnings and like how seller finance works.

**Athena:** Yeah, that is, that is, you know, like if he definitely wants to sell and you can't get lending, that is something an ace up your sleeve for later if you really love that business, you know? 

**Jason:** Yeah, I was also thinking too, you know, if you've been in something for Now I've been doing software engineering for over 20 years.

Like after a while, that's kind of like part of your identity, right? You go to out places and they're like, what do you [01:00:00] do, Jason? I'm like, Oh, you know, I build software for living. They're like, Oh, really? What kind of like, what do you do? I feel like he might have in that same mindset, right? He's been doing this for 35 years.

Like, Oh, he's been a successful businessman for 35 years. He builds skylights. out of metal and plastic and glass, right? So I think there is some of that, right? Where his family may want him to retire, but his identity is wrapped up in this business. 

**Athena:** Yes. Um, it's a really good point. And actually something, especially with like boomers, Their identity is work, you know, so if you can give them paint a picture of like, how they're going to be useful after the sale.

So, because, like, for a lot of men that age, they literally, like, feel like they're going to die if they're not working, you know, facing death and they're like, I don't want to do that. Then that is [01:01:00] something that you can build into the conversation with them is like, how you they will be useful after the fact.

And you'd still love to call them and have them be a mentor and advise you as you go through this and, you know, working out something like that. Like, if you pick up on that, it's like, this person is being pushed by the family. So I need to like, get them visualizing what that's going to mean to spend time with the family while also making sure I help them feel.

Right. And like their, their identity isn't going to die with the sale. Like they still get to be a part of it, even if it's just like, Hey, can we work out something where you're like on the other side of the phone or we meet quarterly and talk through strategy or, you know, like, and they'll be like, Oh my God, I, I don't know if I told you guys this, but the, I told the team, the carwash owner that I was negotiating with.

Myself when I was searching for like months and months and months, and he just wrote me like he sold his car wash for 6 million, which is just like, [01:02:00] um, and he wrote me like a couple months after the sale and he's like, do you know anyone hiring? I need a job. I'm bored. Like, you just got a 6 million exit with no debt on like anything.

And he's like, I need a job, Athena. 

**Jason:** That's crazy. 

**Athena:** So, yeah, and but he came to me because I built that into our conversations. I was like, I want you as an advisor and, like, I would love to, like, get you involved and, like, talking to other business owners and, you know, or, like, entrepreneurs and, like, I was having to do some mentoring at the local university and stuff.

So it doesn't even need to be directly with you. You know, like, if you can give them. A reason for living after the sale when they, when they view no longer working is death. That is a beautiful thing that you can do for them because it makes them more excited about the transition and less apprehensive.

Like it's like, you know, I'm not going to die. I am going to have [01:03:00] utility and purpose after this. So, um, that's a good point and something to think about for him specifically. What might that look like for you? 

**Jason:** Yeah. Right. Right. Also mentioned too, right. Circle back with this person, you know, 90 days, six months, right?

Eventually he's going to want to get like a payday, right? Like if he truly does not want to give it to his kids, cause he feels like he's not going to be out like. Like the opportunity was here. Like we were more than halfway there. 

**Athena:** Yeah. They come back to you. A deal dies at least three times on like, and this is on market, off market.

A deal dies at least three times. So when you, when you're prepared for it and you're ready for it and you can kind of keep it along and keep, keep touching base, like, how are you doing? You know, um, it'll, it'll, it'll a lot of times come back and we've seen that so many times with, with deals that we've looked at and clients like the deals come back, you know, so 

**Jason:** not, it's not, it was still jarring.

It was still jarring, but uh, yeah, I'm back at it. We're going to make this [01:04:00] nice 

**Athena:** work, Jason. Well, um, great. It's so good to see you all. I love chatting about this stuff. Um, on Thursday, like I said, Nash is going to be coming talking about his auto transmission repair business. Um, he bought the real estate in addition to, uh, the business.

Um, he did not necessarily like, you know, he wasn't an auto mechanic because himself he was interested in auto and did a really great culture shift. So he's going to be joining us next week. Um, and then the following week, our very own Andrew is going to be talking about real estate. So, uh, we're going to be working out the specific talking points in terms of real estate in a deal.

What it actually means kind of breaking it down things to think about. Um, so we've got some good stuff lined up as always. The team is here for you. We're excited. There's a lot of movement happening and I think the big takeaway is just keep going, you know, like, it. It's going to get hard, push through it, keep going like it's not that it's not going to happen.

It's just that we [01:05:00] have to keep showing up and maybe extending our timeline or, or doing things that we didn't thought we were going to have to do as part of this process. So yes, Jason, just keep swimming, um, like swans, you know, we're going to look super calm, but below the water, it's like, Oh, just don't give up.

Um, amazing. Cool. So good to see you all. Uh, have a great, looks like sunny where everybody is. So enjoy the weather and we'll see you on Thursday with Nash Anderson. Have a great day. Jason's dog is so cute. Oh my God. Bye.
