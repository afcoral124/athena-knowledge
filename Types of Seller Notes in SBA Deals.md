# 1. Straight-Up Seller Note

- **Definition:** A loan from the seller to the buyer as part of the purchase price, repaid over time with agreed terms.
- **Key Features:**
    - Often subordinate to the SBA loan, meaning the SBA lender gets paid first if there are financial issues.
    - Typical interest rates range from 5% to 10%, depending on negotiation.
    - Amortization schedules vary (e.g., 3–15 years), often with interest-only payments in the early years.
- **Use Case:** Reduces the buyer’s need for external financing while spreading the seller’s payment over time.
    - DSCR must still work
- **Example:**
    - Purchase Price: $1M.
    - Buyer pays $900K upfront; seller provides a $100K note repaid over 5 years.

# 2. Seller Notes as Equity Injection

- **Definition:** A seller note that counts toward the SBA-required 10% equity injection if structured on **full standby** for at least two years.
- **Key Features:**
    - **Full Standby:** No principal payments are allowed during the first two years, although interest payments may be permitted.
    - Reduces the buyer’s upfront cash requirement.
    - Must be approved by the SBA lender and clearly documented.
- **Use Case:** Helps buyers with limited liquidity meet equity injection requirements and can increase buying power. Also can be used as reps & warranties (i.e. seller will have skin in the game)
- **Example:**
    - Project Cost: $1M.
    - Equity Injection Requirement: $100K.
    - Buyer provides $50K cash; seller provides a $50K note on full standby, meeting the 10% requirement.

# 3. Performance-Based Forgivable Seller Notes

- **Definition:** A seller note tied to achieving specific business performance milestones, with forgiveness provisions if those milestones are not met.
- **Key Features:**
    - Treated as a contingent liability, with forgiveness conditional on defined criteria (e.g., revenue retention, customer concentration, employee retention).
    - Must be explicitly labeled as a **forgivable performance-based note** to comply with SBA guidelines.
    - Lender approval is required to include these in the financing package.
    - For it to be on revenue targets, typically must have past performance that matches target to be able to avoid it appearing as an Earn Out (not allowed by SBA)
    - Performance based note must be of benefit to the buyer when used with SBA
- **Use Case:** Mitigates buyer risk by aligning payment obligations with business performance.
- **Example:**
    - $50K performance-based seller note forgiven if revenue drops by more than 20% in the first year after the acquisition.
