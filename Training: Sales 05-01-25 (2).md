0:00 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Perfect. So then, because I'm working on updating... Oh, interesting. Fathom's sending messages now. I need to get... Did you get set up on the premium version of Fathom?

0:20 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  I don't know. It's like creating stuff. I think so. I'm like, it's creating stuff in HubSpot, or like tasks and stuff in HubSpot.  So I would guess that, yeah. I just got this message, though.

0:31 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  It says, Fathom will take notes and summarize a meeting, reply summary to request a copy, get your own free Fathom note taker.  So, like, I don't like sharing notes with people, because it's like our proprietary information. So I don't ever, like, send people call recordings and stuff.  So your Fathom's, like, telling people things that it shouldn't. So we need to look at your settings.

0:54 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  Mine's specific.

0:55 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  What's that?

0:56 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  Is that mine specifically?

0:58 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, your Fathom note taker just... So you might need to go and look in your settings and turn off that, or it might be because you're on a free version and they're trying to market .  Let me send a message to Anka.

1:18 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, there's a bunch of tech stuff that's been  me off this morning. All meetings and auto-share. See, auto-record all meetings and auto-share nothing with attendees.  That's what it says.

1:32 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah. Is there any, like, are you in the Fathom settings on the web browser?

1:39 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  Yes, ma'am.

1:40 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay. Does it say anything about sending messages?

1:47 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  No. Oh, 20 days left and free view. So I'm in the free version.

1:57 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay.

1:58 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  Auto-record recording. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Thank

2:08 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Can you turn off your recording screen, or did you have that option? Why don't you share your screen so I can see what you're doing.
  SCREEN SHARING: Austin started screen sharing - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/289856662?timestamp=144.194969

2:26 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  So auto record all meetings and auto share nothing. Great.

2:30 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Scroll down for me. Okay, click the record notification banner. Turn that off. Great. Scroll down more. Okay, keep going.  No, turn that off. In-meeting chat interface. Stop. That's what it is. Now that should be good.

3:08 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  There's nothing to say, so it should update. I need to...

3:41 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  I'm just checking mine. That might be a new feature that they just... You didn't get a text from me, did you?

3:49 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  No, I haven't. I haven't. Not that I've seen anything.

3:54 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  It would be bad if they just turned on that feature and didn't tell you. don't But... I don't don't care.

4:00 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  I I Oh, they don't have it in mind.

4:03 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, so they add new features to, like, new accounts.

4:08 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  Oh, that makes sense.

4:12 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So there's all sorts of new  we have to catch, but I don't think... Yeah, okay, great. Okay, so then to prepare for Devin...
  SCREEN SHARING: Austin started screen sharing - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/289856662?timestamp=265.137752

4:27 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, I prepared for Devin, correct.

4:33 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay, I would like to talk through feedback first, though, and give you some context, because I think that will help you with your pitch.

4:40 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  Is that cool? Yeah, yeah, absolutely. I appreciate your feedback, Athena, especially where it's actionable and relevant. How does that look on your side?

4:49 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Looks perfect.

4:50 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  Okay, so I'm in the process of, like, the moral of the story is I don't have power... I went on my computer.  I went to download it this morning. It said I needed to update my OS. So now I went through the process to update my OS this morning, and then it wanted to restart, and then it failed.  So it's been a whole ordeal this morning. So I'm just going to have to pop in a little early and set that up, which isn't a big deal.

5:17 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay, cool. Yeah, so we should end at 9.30, I think.
  ACTION ITEM: Record video explaining rationale behind intro script questions and order - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/289856662?timestamp=319.9999

5:24 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  Is that? Yeah, yeah. I'll have a 30-minute gap, so I've got plenty of time.

5:28 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay, perfect. So let me just pull up my notes from yesterday, and then I just want to give you some – I was starting to record, and I might do this anyway, so it's like a training.  But just – I've updated the intro script, and I'm going to record just talking through it and, like, why I asked those questions and why I asked them in the order that I do and what I'm looking to get out of those answers.  So that you have a bit more context. Because, like, it's not just asking the questions. It's actually, like, we need specific information to understand if we can work with someone or not.  So after the Devon call, I'm like, I don't have enough information to actually know if I can do a search for her right now.

6:16 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  But I didn't want to jump in at all. So you'll have to ask some stuff to her today before you go in.

6:25 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Let me pull that up. So I'm going to go through introscript. I'll do a video at some point today.  So then you can watch it. And then we can use our training this afternoon to just talk about how the call with Devon went.  And then feedback from the R event. Because that one was a little tough. I'm sure you felt it was tough for you.  Like, those kinds of clients, like, those kinds of potential clients are rough. So I have some thoughts on that.  Like, don't know. I Okay, so on Devin, do you want the full feedback, or do you just want the questions that you should ask?

7:11 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  Up to you, Athena. Either way is fine.

7:15 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay, so at the beginning, you said a few things that I don't typically say. Like, I never make an assumption that they know who we are, or they've done research.

7:26 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  And you said, I'm sure you've done your research, right?

7:30 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  And it puts someone on the defensive immediately if they haven't. Like, we're not a well-known brand. People don't understand by-side advisory services.  Like, they're not really sure what they're getting into.

7:42 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  Maybe they watched, you know, my deal box video, but it doesn't explain what we do and how we work with people.

7:49 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So I'm just trying to lower the defenses in the intro calls rather than put them on the defense. So, you know, just, I try not to make assumptions.  know, you. They know who we are, what we do, or how we work, or how any of this works.  People that have done things like Acquisition Lab and that have done education and stuff are actually really great fits for us because we don't have to teach them this process.  So I'd compliment them on that and just be like, actually, you know, so when they have that kind of experience coming into it, they usually move much quicker than other people that come in and haven't done something like that before.  Searching full time is also always a red flag for me. Why do you think I think it's a red flag before I give you the answer?

8:47 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  I, this, well, my concern was, is like, is two to four vetted opportunities on a monthly basis going to be a high enough volume to make this leap worth your time?  Like, that was like the, my perceived friction. But educate me.

9:03 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah. So if someone's searching full time, there's a couple of things going on. One, like you need to dig into what the runway is.  Right. A lot of people are like, my job and I'm giving you six months. It's like, well, what if it takes two years?  Right. So it sounds like she's been really great with her money. So I don't think money is an issue with her at all.  Then the other thing is how they get kept busy. So we need to, like, work with you on understanding what those two to four opportunities actually are.  And before you say two to four, you need to explain what they are. Otherwise, people automatically are like, what the , like two deals?  Like, so you have to walk them through the whole process. That's why I always say, like, you know, so instead of, and we don't, it's not just a thousand listings.  Right. That doesn't sound very high. So it's thousands per client per month, like in the multi thousands per client per month that we're scanning.  And then we go through this whole deal process. And I want to get you set up with a team so they can actually take you through their step by step process.  So you can see the amount of work that goes into like every stage. We have HubSpot pipeline set up.  It's like a million stages long. So at every stage, they're like vetting, vetting, vetting, vetting, getting further along. So we are.  And the pain point for most people is scanning all the  listings, signing the NDAs. Oftentimes they like, you know, they'll request for information.  They won't even hear back from the broker. Then they sign the NDA. They don't get the Sims back. So then they have to chase the broker for the Sims like that in itself.  Just getting the information is a big pain in the  for people. Right. And a lot of times brokers want  They even release the SIM without having a phone conversation with them. So before they even know whether the deal is worth their time or not, they've just wasted a whole bunch of time.  So the team is doing all of that. Then they're reviewing the SIMs, the financials, and anything they see in there that they want to discuss and dig into further.  They're having a call with the broker to verify all of that and get good information before we even hand it over to them.  Then they do a write-up, a video. Have you seen a write-up?

11:30 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, just in your video.

11:32 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay, so we need to give you some links to write-up so you can actually go in, watch it, dig into it.  Like, you know, they get links to the broker calls, the team's doing a video walkthrough, they get the SIM and financials to everything and a top-line analysis of what we think and strategy for next steps.  So basically, like, when you explain all of that, and it's like, so you're not sifting thousands of listings, you're getting, like, deals that have, you know, we've sifted through thousands of listings to get.  Two to four that we think are viable and ready to move. And most of our clients now are making offers on the very first deals that we put in front of them.  So when you give all that context before the two to four, then it's like, well, how many deals are you modeling and making offers on per month, right?  Like, do you not think making two to four offers a month is, is a lot? And I also want you to anchor lower, right?  You're like, if I put with them, yeah, yeah, yeah. But again, he doesn't know what that eight means. So you got to remember that these people are used to during doing their own search.  With Devin, she said she's looked at 200 Sims. If she has, then her criteria is . Like, that is a lot, right?  My team's reviewing 12 to 20. Right. For like eight clients. So if she's genuinely gotten like, first of all, that kind of volume to get back 200 Sims in two months is insane.

13:13 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  No way.

13:13 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  I don't believe it. Right. So I've added some things back into the intro meeting. So I would dig into those numbers.  We were just a little confused about how many deals you looked at, because if you look at 200 Sims and you haven't found any that you liked, either you haven't actually looked at 200 or you're eliminating things pretty strictly.  Right. So if you're not having broker convos and digging into that, I'd be concerned that you're not spotting things that could be potential opportunities for you or your criteria.  You know, you're eliminating things without understanding why you're eliminating them.

13:57 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  I don't know if you heard at the end of that call, she walked in. Back a little bit. was like, under 200.  She was like, let's go look at last week. And she was like, I looked at six last week. It's like, even doing like, six times 12, you're at 72.  You know what I mean? If you're reviewing set or six Sims on a monthly or 72 is a  load.

14:19 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Like, so she should, and if she's not following up, having the next broker conversation, there's something going on, right?  And it's probably psychological. Like, she's probably scared to move the next step or she's eliminating things before giving it a fair shake.  So like, like there's something going on there.

14:42 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  So dig into those conversion metrics a little bit.

14:46 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, I'm gonna put some stuff on the intro meeting that I'm adding back in for you. Like, I've removed a bunch of stuff that I used to do because I've just done so many of these now.  But I think it will be helpful for you to have some information to dig into with. So I actually used to get them to be like, okay, tell me last 90 days, like how many listings have you looked at?  How many of those did you request information for? How many did you actually get SIMS back for? How many of those did you actually have broker conversations?  How many of those did you speak to the seller? How many of those did you put an offer? And then they realized like, you know, oh, I've never actually spoken to a seller before.  Right. Right. And it's like, okay, so you can kind of see where the breakdown is. And either they're looking at too much volume and eliminating everything, or they're not looking at enough volume.  They need to be looking at, like, actually our team look at thousands per month, but that's after eliminating from tens of thousands.

15:46 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  Yeah.

15:47 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  You know, it's like, it's because massage team filter it all to them before, before the team even review it.  So it's, it's a lot. For each client. So they're not doing the volume they need to do. Something too is like she didn't respond to any of the text messages.  So I would be like, hey, I tried to message you. Did you get my text messages? And just find out if we have the right number for her, what's going on there.  Right. So like, you know, oh, was trying to text you. didn't hear back from you. Like, did I have the wrong number?  I want them to know it's like a human on the other end of that. It's not just spam. So like when you asked Aravind if that was his mobile number, he was like, I've been texting you.  Like, he was very confused.

16:41 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, 100%. I saw that too.

16:43 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  But also if they're not responding to text, like why, you know, like, are they not getting the text or, you know, doing the wrong number?  I think you need to tell people more about the three to four year timeline. So. Like, you know, Sam Rosati and the SM Bash folks, like, the event, this is, the premier event in M&A, Athena just went to it, you know, two weeks ago, and they're telling people to extend their timeline to three to four years if they're doing this on their own.

17:18 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, that's easy.

17:19 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Cool. Okay. Remote-only businesses is very hard for us.

17:26 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  That's what I was going to ask you about. It's like, that was one component, both, like, back-to-back were remote-only, remote-only.

17:34 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So you need to dig into it. You need to ask more questions about it, right? And be like, hey, remote-only is super competitive.  Like, if you were open to physical locations, where would that be?

17:47 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  Okay.

17:48 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So that's why I'm saying I don't have enough information about her search to know if I can work with her.  So you need to cover that off first in this call and just be like, remote-only is super competitive. We can do it, but you're going to have to go.  Significantly less deal flow, it's going to be much more competitive and expensive. Like, are you open to physical location and places, right?

18:12 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  Talk to me. And maybe I'm just like looking at this through rose-colored glasses, but like you've got like Flippa, Empire Flippers, and Acquisition.com, and those are exclusively technology, remote-focused businesses.  But you're saying like on those businesses, they tend to be highly competitive and it's hard. And like, again, like looking at SaaS specifically, know not all of them are profitable.  So maybe just like help me understand kind of like why those deals are so competitive or why the volumes flow.

18:49 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Everybody wants to remote-building business.

18:52 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  That's right.

18:52 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Everybody wants to be a digital man and be able to work from anywhere and not have to go into an office.  And there's very limited, like that's three sides. Three sites to be able to find remote businesses, you know, like, so it's highly competitive because everybody wants a remote business.  And then also you've got the tech, big tech who buys my tiny companies to, you know, like, remove competition from the market.  so they just might not have thought of businesses that would be a good fit for them in their geography.  But if they only want remote businesses, I don't, you know, I would be honest with them, like, I'm not sure we'll be able to deliver you the kind of deal flow we like to see.  So you can have a coaching moment there and be like, look, you're, everybody wants a remote business, you know, everybody wants recurring revenue, everybody wants, you know, that dream.  Now, we'll obviously look for those kinds of businesses. But So I just want to manage your expectations that you're going to be on the lower end of that two per month, and it's going to be highly competitive to do something like that.  So if that sounds okay, then we can do that. But I think we should probably consider, you know, if there's any locations or businesses that, you know, could potentially be made remote.  So you can use the example, like with her, and like Kevin and Lindsay's testimonials are like perfect for her to think about, both like tech consulting backgrounds, that sort of thing.  So they bought a media agency, and they're converting it to a remote company, because the owners just didn't know how to do remote, but it's perfectly capable of being a remote business.

20:45 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  That's like a one to two year transition.

20:48 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So I would give those kinds of examples, like, well, you know, what about something that could potentially be, you know, semi remote or fully remote?

21:01 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  Like talking about like coming into the office a couple days a month or, you know, or like a couple days a week or a couple days a month, depending on what the structure's been built out within that organization.

21:13 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, like are there conditions that you would be willing to go to a location? If so, what locations would you be willing to do?  And then if somebody's living in California, I would say like, hey, California is probably one of the worst states for businesses.  Like, it's not a great state to own a business. So, you know, just just making you aware that there's a whole bunch of laws and regulations that cripple businesses, which is why nobody likes, you know, having a business there and they move to other states.  So just I would sense check that they understand what the business, small business regulations are in California. Something you said that I think you need to be careful  Careful about is, you said, I think you need to be careful with giving your opinions about what industries are good and not good.

22:12 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  Fair enough.

22:14 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  You said, I don't love SaaS without knowing whether she liked SaaS or not.

22:19 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, careful on industry school.

22:23 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Because like somebody is going to want to, they're on a call where they're getting qualified of whether they can work with us or not.  You know, so like you inject your opinion like that and they're like, this is their dream, right? Like they get to, that's the whole point of working with us is we're going to, we're the fairy godmother.  That's like, tell me everything you want and we'll see if we can make it happen for you. So. Yeah, like I tell the team this a lot.  When I have an opinion about an industry to make it very clear, it's my opinion, but there's like good things to it.  That's not the place to do. We'll it now. We'll do it as part of the onboarding process. But it makes sense, like, I felt her kind of, like, shut down a little bit on that one.  Really, it's like, tell me more about other tech businesses, other remote areas that you'd be interested in, and why, you know, she's got a background where she could, like, if she knows her stuff, then SaaS might be a perfect fit for her.  Like, when people say they want operators, I would ask why. Sometimes it's coming from a place that they don't feel like they're a good leader, or they don't want to lead.  Small business, too. When you're saying, like, have you had exposure to a small business? It's not just about the financials.  Like, it's the culture. It's the operation. Corporations, it's managing people, like, on a small level without HR departments and, you know, the corporate structures.  That's more of my concern than them understanding, like, the financials, like, and financials of small businesses are going to look very different.  But that question is more about what's your familiarity with what kind of work environment you're going to be getting yourself into.

24:26 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  Okay, yeah, that's helpful.

24:31 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, 200 Sims in one to two months is a ton. So how is she getting that many? How many broker in her conversations has she had?  Yeah, the demonstrating what we do before throwing out two to four. When you are asking about marriage? the I don't know.  Yeah. You Where do you think, or what do you think the purpose of that question is?

25:06 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  Understanding if, like, if that's going to create friction in that sales process, right? Like, making sure that, like, hey, if you have a spouse, do you have their support?  Do they actually know what you're doing? And, like, do they have buy-in and actually going out to buy a business?  Or, like, are you doing this behind your back? And then it's going to be a selling conversation that we have to have later.

25:28 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Right. So with men, you will know how to have that conversation. With women coming from you, they're going to be like, who the  are you asking me if I need permission?

25:40 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  Right? You have to be really careful about how you bring that up. Yeah, yeah.

25:47 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So, and I felt her get bristly, like, you know, like asking a single woman who's in her 40s whether she's married and has kids.  It's like, it's a not great thing. So another way of asking the question is like, hey, are you searching with anyone else?  Is there anyone involved in making this decision with you? Because like we work with couples a lot who do the search together.  So it's good to get us on the same page if that's going to be the case.

26:18 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  Cool. Yeah, that's a much softer way to ask that question.

26:21 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, that's why I was like, oh, I haven't given the context behind the questions and also with women.

26:26 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  I don't want to ask this question. Yeah, I literally feel it as I'm like reading it. I'm just like, I don't even want to ask this right now.

26:36 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  No, and that's the thing. It's like questions there for me to like, it's like, oh, I need to find out what's going on.  So I'll ask questions in different ways, depending on who it is. So yeah.

26:51 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  That call will be able to memorize eventually, Athena.

26:54 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, great.

26:56 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  Go ahead.

26:58 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  I've also changed the screen. So it's, again, taking hundreds of people through the acquisition process, sell and buy side.  So just hundreds of people, hundreds of buyers through the process. I'm very particular about making sure we're not misrepresenting ourselves.  So I've changed that. I've put together a new, like, script. Yeah, the rest is kind of general feedback about intros, so we can go into that later.

27:34 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  Okay.

27:35 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  With her... She was on... She had her shell up the whole time. We didn't really get to know the real Devin.  And that's what you want to kind of get to know through that process. You want to get them to, like, drop the shell a bit.  Mm-hmm. And she started opening up about, you know, the hospice and developmental volunteer work. And it's like, what got you into that?  Like, was there something that happened there? Also, I realized that the question wasn't in the intro meeting, but like, you know, like, hey, you know, I know you said you were the searching, but like, what made you decide, like, now is the right time to do this?  Like, what was the tipping point? You know, and then they'll be like, oh, this thing happened at work. You want to try to, like, get more, like, connection with them as to, like, their why and who they are as people, which makes the next part of the process, like, so much easier.  So just thinking of that, like, as you're going through the call, is like, is their shell still up, you know, and you can feel it, right?

28:51 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  Did you feel that from her? Oh, yeah, uh-huh. I felt it with Morgan, too, as well. Like, Arvin, not as much.  Like, he just was, like, illegal, a little... Egotistical, you know what I mean? Like, that's my opinion on Arvin.  But, like, he was, like, honest and transparent and gave us good data. And I think, like, Morgan did to a point as well.  But, like, you could tell that, like, I wasn't able to make that, like, really personal connection with him. Or, like, it was more like a data-driven conversation.  So I would agree that, like, that Oh, I didn't get that from him at all. Really? I thought there was a disconnect between him throwing out things he was passionate about and you acknowledging those.  That's fair.

29:30 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  You know, because you kept going to, like, autonomy and control. And he was talking about people, purpose, mission.

29:36 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  So I felt like he was very much, like, telling us who he was and what's important to him.

29:43 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So it's connecting with him on that level. And you'll get it, you know. Because this is a different sales process, I think, than probably other people have.  Because I care so much about, you know, who they are and why they're doing it. And them feeling like they have.  Thank you. You know, an advisor they can trust in this because this whole process is super overwhelming. You have a bunch of people telling you all the  you're doing wrong.  There's not really like a strong roadmap for someone to hold your hand through the process. It's like, you know, I'm capable of doing this, but like, I'm just feeling completely out of my depth and overwhelmed.  And I'm getting brokers like slamming the door in my face all the time. So there's this feeling that people like people feel like they need to prove that they know what they're doing right when they don't.  And that sucks. So it's like, um, with Morgan, like, it's awesome. You went through acquisition lab, great people to learn from, like, sounds like you're trying to get your reps in.  You know, what's not happening? Like, where is it? Like, what's stopping you from figuring this out on your own?

30:47 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  Because you're totally incapable of doing it. Right.

30:50 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So, yeah.

30:51 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  that's what we're talking about, like, talking more as a peer, as opposed to being like, you know, I'm like curious.  I'm like, I really would, it would be. It's helpful to like even walk through or just like flag it in a specific call you know it's like hey like here's how I would have responded because like I'm very good at emulation and like until I actually grab that concept and I think like part of it is just like like I'm not even focused on the emotions on the person on the other side of the screen for me because like I'm still like working on getting through that initial script you know what saying.  So I think that that's part of it but like that would be absolutely welcome and like you're not going to hurt my feelings of getting that at all.

31:38 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  No and I you know like I said I haven't trained sales people before but I don't think there are like other sales organizations or whatever like care about that or even teach that or is it you know it's not important to get back to the emotions like you know the money.

31:54 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  know it's not important to to my past two roles like the my managing director was like the Most condescending  you've ever met in your entire  life.  And he was like, yeah, bro. Like, he's like, you're being white. And like, I got that, like, consistently, consistent feedback working in IBU.  Like, you're being too nice. You need to have more teeth in conversation. Like, they want their banker to, like, understand what they're talking about and have a little more teeth.  And I'm like, dude, like, I'm pretty, like, cutting in how I talk to people. Like, I'm like, I don't understand what you're saying.  But that was, like, consistent feedback that I got there. And then same thing with, like, New Chip was, like, you need to establish yourself as a subject matter expert and have a little bit of bite when you're talking to people.  And not, like, make them understand that, like, you know more than they do. And, like, you're here to help them.  But, like, you have to establish that credibility, especially if you're talking to a founder that's, like, has been doing this for 10 years.  You know, it's like that more, like, soft touch approaching this as a peer, like, definitely isn't something. like, know, know, like, know, know,  Like, I've done consistently throughout my career, you know?

33:03 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, I mean, you know, I'm sure everybody has their preference, but, like, how did that work out for a new chip, you know?  Look, the thing I think we need to lean on, right, in what we do is source for people. And then we don't just, like, bat it over to them.  We help them once we find the business. So, like, you don't need to lean too heavily on what you don't know and, like, that aspect of it.  Because then we start getting into being by-side brokers and advisors, right? So, like, it's, like, it's not a good use of your time to sift through thousands of listings, Madam Devin, who has all that amazing experience.  Like, it's a better use of your time, skill set, and brain to be moving viable deals down, you know?  Like, and our team is going to, you know, what people offer. Do is like, and she's seeing it with the search fatigue is they'll put on blinders, they'll eliminate potentially hidden gems.  Like, it's a waste of  time. We're saving them time. So when it's like, ah, you know, like, I feel respected.  I am on the right path. It is just an enormous amount of work that I can't do on my own, you know, and they're going to help me with it.  And they're going to be by my side on the on the parts that, you know, I don't know what's coming next.  I don't know what I don't know. And it's like, you know, you can say, like, I know you'll be able to figure this out, right?  But do you want to steal our homework? Or do you want to spend, you know, months or years figuring it out on your own?  Like, we'll essentially just give you the roadmap. So you can follow that rather than having to do it on your own.  So just play to the this, we need people with strengths and skills, we want people going into business ownership that are capable business owners.  So if we come in, and we're like, we know more than you, should we even be taking on as  Clients, if they don't have the right skills to be a business owner and survive on their own, that doesn't feel good to me, you know?  So, yeah, I'm very much like, I'm also evaluating them in the call. Like, do I believe this person will be a good business owner?  You know, and if they have great skills, great background, great outlook, they've taken action, you know, they've taken action despite, like, fear, or they're just like, I just need the right kick, you know, the right roadmap, and I'll take the action, then awesome.  I don't need to dress them down, but I can coach them and make them aware of some areas maybe that they haven't thought of before.

35:47 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, that makes sense.

35:51 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So, yeah, you don't need to do that here. It's one of the things that has served me. Really well on the searcher community, one of our values is leave them better than you found them.  Whether someone's a client or not, want them to feel like every touch that they had with us was a good one, and they left with something worthwhile.  On our event, he didn't understand what we did, right? So that needed to be addressed kind of early on, because he came to us after I was talking about how to buy a Canadian business with private debt.  And he's like, I need help getting money. And I was like, I only do that for clients. And he's like, what do you do?

36:33 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  And I was like, here's a link. And then he filled out the form.

36:37 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So I don't know how much he read it or whatever, and just like filled out the form. But I don't ever offer introductions to my investor contacts.  I'll help them figure out how to structure it. But like,  no, am I making an introduction? If I don't think that, like, if I wouldn't invest in that person, I'm not making introductions to my contacts.

36:58 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  Right. Yeah, that makes sense.

37:00 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So you kind of like offered that out in the call too. So I was like, no, no, no, no.  Like we don't, we'll help people figure out how to do the funding aspect and how to get funding, but we won't make introductions to private debt or investors.  Lenders, absolutely.

37:18 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  That makes sense. I wasn't, I knew the investor component, but I wasn't aware on the private debt side. Because like my assumption is like, it's just an underwriting process the same way a bank would, you know.

37:29 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  I wouldn't feel, like I need to know more, it's still an investor, right? They're an investment group. And if I'm sending them people that they're like, I would never invest in this person, that burns that relationship for me.

37:45 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, 100%.

37:46 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So I don't offer it on the, like, you know, it's like when the appropriate time will make, will make lending introductions or whatever.  But like, he was on the call because like, he didn't have enough money to get a deal done. Like, why are you going out?  $7 million deals if you don't know how to get it done, you know?

38:06 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  Based on his IRA or, like, his 401k, know, like, he probably actually had enough money if the seller was willing to carry a fortune of that in a note to be able to, like, qualify for that opportunity without bringing in outside capital.  So you know that SBA changes, though, that the seller note can't be applied to equity injection anymore? Right, but he had $500,000 within that IRA and then an additional $130,000 cash.

38:32 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Was it an IRA or a 401k?

38:35 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  401k, 401k, you're right.

38:37 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah.

38:38 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  Can you not do, like, a self-directed IRA through Quest and then, like, have them invest in the LLC?

38:47 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  You can't be an active owner. It has to be a passive. So that's why the ROM strategy only works for 401ks and it's an investment into your own business.  That you can be the active operator in. But for IRAs, if you make the investment into a business, you cannot be an active owner of it.

39:10 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  That makes sense. That makes sense. Yeah, I follow.

39:14 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah. We'll dig into his a little bit later because I wrote down a bunch of notes. But, you know, I think the main takeaway from that is try to get an understanding of what they think we do before we dig into the call.  And also, I'll go through the whole intro script and what I ask at what point because he got stuck on the timeline.
  ACTION ITEM: Prep for Devin call - dig into full-time search timeline, remote-only business restrictions, conversion metrics from listings to broker convos - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/289856662?timestamp=2373.9999  And the point of that question wasn't to start digging into their timeline. was a different point to it. So I'll talk you through the kind of overall structure, why I do it that way and what I'm hoping to get out of that.

39:44 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, yeah, absolutely. And then just to confirm. So what I need to talk to Devin about is like searching full time.  What sort of runway and realistic expectations does she have around and like I'm going to frame. And that probably was like, hey, how quickly do we need to get this done?  And like, also maybe- No, no, no, no.

40:08 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  How long before you have to go back to work? Like, how long of a runway do you have? Because like, if you're saying how quickly do we need to get this done, you're insinuating we can do things quicker than we can and we can't.  So I don't want to plant that seed, right? So it's like, how, okay, you're doing this full time. Like, have you given yourself an amount of time before you have to go back to work?  What's that going do to your personal financial situation? You know, like, most people when they're searching full time, give themselves like six months, you know, and then they start getting desperate and crazy about things.  So it's like not a good client for us if they have unrealistic timeline expectations because they're watching their bank account dwindle.  Sounds like she has enough money in the bank, but that's not going to be an issue. But just like dig into the full time searching timeline, like  Hey, you know, like SM Bash, Sam Rizzotti and that crew, they're saying three to four years. If you're doing this on your own, like, do you have that?  Can you go three to four years? You know?

41:14 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, that's helpful. And then remote component.

41:18 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, like, are you, so if they're very, that's an industry restriction, in my opinion, right? So it's like, okay, let's talk more about remote businesses.  Like, if she's saying I would do MSPs, e-commerce, SaaS, you know, services, businesses, whatever, that might be enough, but I'd still have to go and check with the team.  I don't typically see people that just want remote only. It's like, I just don't feel good about the amount of deal flow we can potentially get to them at the size that she wants.  So you can get a bunch of tiny ones, you know, but the, the, like, 750 EBITDA range, like, strategics are coming in, right?  Like, it's, it's, well, and she's, so I would ask her, those 200 sims, did they all match that? Were they all remote businesses, the 750 EBITDA?  Like, where are you getting those, you know? And like, why, why weren't they good, right? 200 sims is a lot, you know?  And she's like, oh, it wasn't 200. it's like, okay, that's okay. Like, tell me how many sims have you actually looked at?  And then how many of those did you proceed to a broker conversation? And how many owners have you had a conversation with?  If she's not had any owner conversations yet, like, that's a skill gap that we can also help her fill.  But I'm just worried, like, and I would just be like, it sounds to me that you might be a little too tight on your criteria before you explore whether something's a worthwhile opportunity or not, which is what the team can do, right?  Like, we're not going to restrict things early, and you'll explain that through the process, but, like, it sounds like her funnel is too tight early on if she actually is getting that kind of volume through.  And then on the location, like, say, like, hey, there's businesses that can be, you know, made semi-remote or converted to remote businesses.  So, you know, Kevin on our website, he bought a media agency, and he's in the process of converting it to, and he has a tech background, right, tech sales background, and he's in the process of converting it to a remote business.  That process can take a year or two. So, like, are you open to those kinds of businesses? And the reason why I ask is because if you're just a remote only, I'm not sure we could get you the kind of deal flow that I'd be comfortable with taking you on as a client.  But are there certain situations that you'd be open to having something that had a physical location? Let her talk and then say, okay, if so, where, right?  Like, what locations would you consider? And then I, you know, and then if she's like, oh, California, or, you know, hopefully names off a couple places that she'd be willing to move or something like that.  Um, if she's stuck on her remote only, then with that amount of money, like do the full call, see where she's at.  I think she's, you've already got her backup about the two to four. So you're going to have to do a really good job of explaining what those mean and why it's not like, it's not just, she's thinking two to four Sims, right?  She's got 200 in her head that she's looking at.

44:40 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  Yeah. Yeah. That's helpful. That's helpful. And then anything else that you think would be important to cover in terms of like negative at the beginning of that call?

44:49 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  I wouldn't say negatives. I'd just be like, you know, we have concerns, want to chat through it and, you know, see how you feel about things, um, you know, to, before.  Or I like pull up the deck and start pitching you. Right. That's usually how I do it. And it's like concerns that our service might not be a great fit.

45:11 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  Yeah. But anything else you think we should entertain in that portion? No, my big thing is like, would she be open to more industries?

45:20 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  And sometimes they don't think big enough for themselves. So they've like, they've restricted the industry because that's what they've been told.  But, you know, you can say like part of our process is actually exploring you as a person getting, you know, skill sets, backgrounds, your interests.  So we could look at all these things that you're also passionate about and present you businesses maybe that you hadn't even thought of before.  I use the example of Lindsay. What was really important to them was being involved in the community and this dance studio came up for sale.  And I was like, oh my God, like there's only certain types of people that can handle dance moms and like Lindsay.  He's one of those people. So I got in touch with her and I was like, hey, did you dance at all growing up?  She's like, I was a competitive dancer. And I was like, oh my God. And it's like in the community, they have recurring revenue.  Parents just signed up for the entire school year. Like every year, the lady like raised the revenue. The business model was sound.  The deal ended up not working out because the broker misrepresented the SDE. Like she had a miscalculation of the SDE that was significant enough that it eliminated.  But Lindsay went and met the owner, loved her.

46:34 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  Like if the numbers had checked out, she probably would have bought that business.

46:38 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Did she put dance studios on her list? No, right. But it like had all the like the owner set up a solid structure and business.  Lindsay's skill set was like, you know, great for handling dance moms. She had a dance background, would have never thought of that.  So that's part of what we do is like we look at opportunities they might not have ever. And if we see there's a real strong opportunity for Devin to apply her skill set, or maybe there's something along the developmental disability, like a business in that, or stuff that she's passionate about, or these other service-based things, like advertising companies that have a physical location where the owners just haven't converted it to a remote business.  So, but we need to know where she'd be willing to relocate to, or have a physical business, or if she's even open to that.

47:38 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  And if she's not, you can just be like, look, I am happy to tell you about our services, but remote only is pretty tough at the level that you're looking at for SDE.

47:51 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So I'd need to go back and have a chat with the team to see if we feel like you're going to get the amount of deal flow that we feel good about.  You know, yeah, that makes sense. And then, like, covering off the two to four, dig into her numbers more before you get there.  And it's like, so are you talking to, like, two to four brokers and owners a month?

48:16 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, yeah. Probably not. Yeah, dig into those metrics. I think in that initial portion as well, I like, hey, talk to her about, like, what sort of volume are you doing?  Like, you mentioned 200. I just kind of reverse engineered the six that you gave me from last week. Like, that's about 72 over a few months.  know, like, are you, like, having conversations with the brokers or simply just getting the sins? Like, how many broker conversations have you had?  Have any of those actually progressed to getting in front of the business owner? And then, like, walking through that, and that'll make it a little more defensible when we get to that, like, two to four number where it's like, hey, look.  It's like two, I'm talking two to four highly better. There are opportunities where we've had that initial call with the broker, next steps from here, typically like reaching out, having a brief introduction with the broker, and then moving very quickly into a conversation with the owner prior to submitting an LOI, hopefully within the week, right?  So these are opportunities that you can expect to move forward on very, very quickly, like most of our clients do here.

49:22 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, and you can say like, you know, most of our clients are like, interested in taking action on the very first deals that we put in front of them.  And there's a lot of work when you have to do the financial modeling, you have to start getting your LOI together, you have to like think of the strategy and all the variables of it, you're consulting with us on like what needs to be in that you're talking with the broker to get more clarity, you know, checking that the lending can actually be worked.  Like, if you've never submitted an LOI, you don't like the, you know, the fire drill that you're going to go on, and we're putting two to four of those potentially in front, you're going to be busy, right?  And we're also going to give you homework, like, to get ready in the meantime. So the other thing with full-time searchers is the onboarding process, like, taking one to two months can bother them, right?

50:13 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  Because we're talking about, like, June versus start date, No.

50:18 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So if they sign up in May, then we need at least 30 days. We start searches on the first of every month.  So now we're looking at July 1st.

50:31 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  Okay.

50:32 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, so everyone in May is going to be looking at a July 1st. And then when we hit June, then they'll be looking at August 1st.  So you can use the end of the month as a kind of, like, get signed up. But it does put a lot of pressure on the team to try to do it in 30 days.  Can be done. But, like, at this point, no. Anka's off for her wedding. And she's the one that, like, handles this process.

50:58 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  So, like, it'd be July at this point. Yeah, that makes sense. makes sense.

51:01 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  But that's why I really emphasize, like, it's going to feel like slowing down, especially when you've been doing this.  But like, this is laying the foundation and programming the GPS. So like, you and us are very clear. And it will actually speed you up overall, because we're going to have like a really sound thesis that we're working off of for you.

51:24 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, that makes sense. Um, what else, Athena? I'm like, we probably don't have time to run through that call this morning, which is fine.  I went through the script. Yeah, the only two slides that I don't have built out yet are so I went and put in like, a couple of points on like all the team members listed there.  And then like, walking through kind of your origin story. I finished that I did the top component when we were talking about see Um...  Um... Basic transition. The origin story was the one that I didn't have done last night. One through four, when they're talking about like the temperature.

52:30 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  I'm to switch that to she. Oh, you said you haven't done this yet.

52:40 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  Oh, for the investment component, the one through four.

52:45 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Oh, no, I'm looking at origin story because you're going to be reading that. So, right?

52:51 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, most likely. have a pretty good understanding about actually hearing you go through that. So that changed everything for her.  So if you realize. Yeah, thought I got them all changed. I used the transcript and threw in the chat GPT and was like, build me a script for that component.  And then went and actually listened to deliver that to the name starts with an O.

53:19 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay, cool. Let me just read it real quick. Oh, cool. I love that. All right. No, I don't. I'm temporarily doing a delivery, so I don't want to set the expectation that I'm going to be the better contact person.

53:51 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  Oh, our founder and fearless leader just killed us. I'm like, that's redundant. We don't need that anyways.

55:00 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Thank you. Okay, where else did you need me to look? The investment.

55:42 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  Say that again.

55:44 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  That's what you needed me to. Oh, okay. Video walkthrough. Great.

55:50 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  The other one, one through four at the bottom was the one I wanted to ask you about.

55:55 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay, cool. Let me read your video walkthrough real quick.

55:59 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  Okay. read your Let read Let read

56:15 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Great. Great. Great. Great. Great. Okay.

56:58 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  I read through this while I watched. Thank That video, too, to make sure it, like, flowed and made sense.  Great.

57:12 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Wow. Yeah, I love it. I think there's still an opportunity here. Again, most people have no idea how buy-side advisory works.  So I think it's a good anchor point to explain, like, you know, typically what you're going to get is somebody who's going to charge you 5% to 10% of your deal price.

57:49 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  Where are you looking at this? Are you at the bottom talking about investment?

57:52 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, I just left you a comment on straightforward success feed.

57:59 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  So... Here's where I struggled, is two and three are very similar, and those were the ones that I wanted to talk to you about, because I'm like, when two is talking about a straightforward success fee, where now we have a success fee, but only kind of, you know what I'm saying?  It's like more of like professional services. So like, I just didn't know the best approach to take here. So like the first one, I tried to focus on like, complex and variable success fees, but then the next one is like kind of similar, because it's like, if you're charging a success fee, your interests aren't aligned.
  ACTION ITEM: Rework investment section in presentation - explain traditional buy-side advisor fees, SBA compliance, milestone-based structure, risk for first-time buyers - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/289856662?timestamp=3514.9999  So I was curious on your thoughts, like to this component specifically.

58:45 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah.

58:48 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  So what I focused on in the initial one is like SBA compliance, and then But they still need to understand how people normally charge  Yeah, that's fair.

59:03 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  You can say like, look, yeah, would say like, okay, traditionally, like if you're going to a buy side advisor, so a broker, someone that sources deals for you, they're going to be charging you a percentage of the deal size, which is typically like five to 10% of the deal size.  Now, we're over here like, why would you charge someone that you're helping buy a business because we want you to get the best business.  Now, with the recent SBA guideline changes, also, many of those people are no longer going to work with people that are using SBA funding because they don't believe their fees are going to be paid.  So we've made something that is SBA compliant, is, you know, lower price than anyone else in the market for something like this.  And then it allows you to like, Allows us to be able to help first-time buyers that are using SBA money.  So you kind of want them to think, like, no one else is going to work with you. Also, like, we're doing this out of integrity, and, like, it's lower than anyone else.  Like, you know, it is. Because they're charging 5% to 10%, and they're still going to want that money somehow.  So either you're going to have to come up with all that money out of pocket and not be able to put it in a loan.  Or they're not going to work with you because you can't do that. But even still, like, are our incentives aligned?  Like, I want you to get the best price. So I'm not going to advise you to buy bigger businesses or offer more money.  I'm also not going to treat you differently because you have a different buying power than my other clients.

1:00:49 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  So feel free to revisit that whole section.

1:00:52 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  The important points for me are, like, they know what they're paying up front. They understand how the other people charge.  So when they get hit with our fee, because they have no context for the price we're about to give them.  That's why I do it before I give them the price. So they're like, oh, , you know, I haven't, you can even throw out numbers.  So like, you know, that could be looking at like 300 to 500,000 that you're paying to another buy side advisor.  Right. So then they're like, holy . And then, and then they're relieved when they hear we're only a hundred.  So this section is needed to rework anyway. So this SOP guideline change gives us that. And then you can also say like, you know, we're milestone based.  Our, our fees are aligned with your incentives. So like brokers that work on success fee only, they don't care about whether the deal is a good fit for you.  They just want you to buy something. We don't do that. So our team's paid on the front end. And you can also say something about the risk with first buyers too.  Like 98% of first time buyers aren't going to close, you know? So we have a hundred percent success rate of getting people into.  And LOI before they end services doesn't mean they're going to close. We're not building a business off whether you're going to have the bravery to move through the final process.  We are going to put deals in front of you that you absolutely can close that are a match for you and help you get them under offer.  So there's a sheer amount of work that goes into that to make it happen. So you can rework that whole section and present it to me.

1:02:27 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  You don't have to keep it with those exact points. Four bullet points. Yeah, that's helpful. It'll probably be later on today.  One, I have to go to. I'm heading to the city to go to that event. It's probably like right after our call this afternoon.  So I'll do my best to get to it today. But yeah, that's helpful that I'm able to just like take some liberty there and like change what those bullets are.  Yeah, well, give me to sign it off first. Yeah, I hope you.

1:02:57 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  It needed a rework anyway. Like I think the important things is like. Like anchoring that other services are trying to get a shitload of money or, you know, we're not trying to screw them over.  We're not going to do a success fee because like they're likely it's going to be them is the reason it doesn't close, us.  So we're essentially a source and match company. We source deals. We will source deals. But it's on them to take the deal and run with it.  And we're there to support them through that process. But, you we can't make it. We can't buy the business for them.

1:03:31 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, that makes sense. And so the analogy I sometimes use is like, you know, the World Series of Poker, which you also we need to get you all the emails that are going out to people on the drip.  There's a like when somebody signs up on the forum. Has Anka shared that with you? I'm getting like HubSpot on contact.

1:03:51 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  The what?

1:03:52 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  I've seen them in like HubSpot. Like I've like scrolled through quite a few of the like leads that have come in yesterday and it's like looking at each of the individuals.  you And emails that you were sending out. But I haven't looked at a doc specifically, if that's what you're asking.

1:04:06 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah. So the point there is just to give them education. Each one of those is a deep dive on a different area.  So my hair is doing something crazy there. So you can start to learn how I think about deals and some analogies that I use and that sort of thing.  So just when you have some spare time, like start reading those. But the analogy that I've been using recently is like, you know, this whole business buying world is like the World Series of Poker.  Anyone can enter, right? And there's skill levels of all sizes. And you can either do this by yourself and keep playing through all the tables to try to get a shot at the final table.  Or when you work with someone like us, we're going to sit down at the final table. But at that final table, you still have to play the cards, right?  We can whisper in your ears, but you still have to play. And you're playing against professionals, people that know what they're doing, strategics, other buyers, you know, so competition is scary.  And like, with all the guidance that we give you, like, you still have to play that hand. But are you more likely to win sitting at that final table more times than having to start at the beginning of the tournament and try to play your way all the way through to the final table?

1:05:24 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, that makes sense. That makes sense.

1:05:26 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Um, okay, let me look at the rest of this. Yeah, this was the part that I missed out of the, um, but that seemed to help.  I like that.

1:05:41 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  I picked up on you doing that in the videos that you had me watch as, like, anchoring high. And, like, the other things I noticed that I didn't do yesterday is I didn't call out the video again, and I also, um, Yeah, I didn't call out the video again.
  ACTION ITEM: Share updated intro script with Austin - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/289856662?timestamp=3953.9999

1:05:59 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I'll need 90 minutes from you, and I'm going to send you a video with our thesis.  I want you to watch that before tomorrow. It'll make our conversation more productive. So I'm going to send you the new script that I'm working on.  I'll hopefully remember to add that in at the end. If I didn't, then just add that in. I always just say it, but it wasn't in the script, so that's my bad.  Oh, wait. Okay.

1:06:28 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  It's on the side. I should have just put it in there, but this was the first one I did.

1:06:33 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Oh, okay.

1:06:35 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  And I've got it in Word if you want me to just quickly copy and paste.

1:06:42 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  I'd say if you rather than we've.

1:06:52 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  If you, yeah, I got you.

1:06:55 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  We don't want to, we just want to make it really clear who does what, right?

1:07:00 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, the remaining $38,000 is due.

1:07:06 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Let's see. This ability to include in the loan, you often need to explain that before you go into price, because I can't tell you how many people do not understand equity injection or what that means.

1:07:23 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  The ability to include fee in the loan, yeah, up here. We built strong relationships with lenders and recognized that we provide.  Yeah, I'm like, essentially, these are, these costs act as a prepayment for the required down. So I try and be really specific and then add the cherry on top of, like, legal and accounting, and I didn't know if you'd love that component either.

1:07:49 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Uh, no, they, they need to do that on their own. Yeah. Like, you can, like, that is, so what I, what I do as a check-in is, like, do you understand sources and uses?  This project cost versus purchase price. A lot of people don't realize that there's a whole bunch of fees on top of the loan, right?  So I try to get an understanding of how much they understand that process, because the equity injection concept is going to fly right over their head if they don't understand what that means.  So, like...

1:08:24 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  Say that one more time. Sources and uses of project cost.

1:08:27 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Uh-huh. Do you understand what I mean when I say that?

1:08:32 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, yeah. Like, you're saying, like, the additional... Like, you can add sources and uses in the sense of, like, if you pay an accountant, that's considered, like, sources and uses, which is, like, towards the overall cost of the project.  So, like, you're not... Like, if you see a business that's $2 million, like, you have an SBA fee, you have attorney fees, you've got accounting fees, like, all of the fees associated with, like, actually getting this to the finish line.  That be counted towards your sources and uses.

1:09:00 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Thank you. Do a favor. Don't use accounting. I want you to either say QV or financial due diligence.

1:09:07 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  Cool. Yeah.

1:09:09 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Because accountants often have no idea that accountants don't know what they're doing. So just like I try to anchor them early with the right language so that when we're like, you need a QV provider and they're like, I said I could do like, no, but you said accountant, you know.  Um, so, yeah, but, um, sorry, I interrupted your flow.

1:09:29 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  Go ahead. But that's like essentially what sources and uses of a project or like in terms of like the project.

1:09:36 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah. Sources is where's the money coming from. Uses is what is the loan proceeds going towards. So sources is like equity injection of 10%.  Seller note, total loan payment. Sometimes there'll be investment money. That's a source of where the capital is coming from.  The use is what the overall loan is going to be used towards. So it'll be usually working capital, paying the seller, paying the project costs, paying the lawyer, paying the QV, paying us, paying your SBA fees.  And so I say usually estimate 5% of the deal as your project costs, in addition to what you pay us.

1:10:37 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  That makes sense.

1:10:41 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So do a check-in before you go into the price to see their understanding of how, and you don't need to be patronizing about it.  I know the SBA thing is super complicated. It's like, do you understand equity injection sources and uses, project costs, like that whole thing?  And they're like, they'll be like, I mean, don't worry. Like, it took... It a while to wrap my head around it.  It's complicated. But basically, I want you to understand before I tell you the price how it works. Because if they don't understand that they can add that back into the loan or apply it towards a down payment, they think they're $100,000 out of pocket, right?  So it's like you can add it into the loan and amortize it over the life of the loan.

1:11:21 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  But we can't add it into the loan.

1:11:23 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yes, you can.

1:11:24 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  The $30,000.

1:11:26 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  The $100,000 gets added to the loan. The $70,000 they've already paid comes off their equity injection.

1:11:33 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  Yeah. Okay. Yeah.

1:11:34 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So they have to put the full amount into the loan in order for the amount they've paid us to count towards their equity injection.

1:11:42 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  Yeah. So it's counting towards a down payment as opposed to being amortized over 10 years. Well, it doesn't matter.

1:11:48 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  No, it still will be amortized over 10 years, right? Because it's so, say the business is a million dollars.  And our overall fee, the $70,000 plus the $30,000.

1:12:00 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  It's $100,000. Their loan is now $1.1 million. I follow.

1:12:07 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  The bank says you need to pay us $110,000 as your equity injection, but you've already paid them $70,000, so give us $40,000.

1:12:15 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, that makes sense. I follow.

1:12:17 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, so the whole amount has to be added into the total project cost, so they will be paying interest on our fees, the total fees, but then it's a business expense versus an out-of-pocket cost that can't It be used for anything.

1:12:31 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  If they have enough money that it doesn't matter, okay, you don't have to add it back into the loan, but you can't treat it towards equity injection.  Yeah, that makes sense. And you do it with legal fees and QVPs, too, so they'll ask you for money up front before the loan closes, but if you're like, okay, I've paid $15,000 to the lawyer, I need to pay another $15,000, you're going to add $30,000 to the loan.  Yeah, that makes sense.

1:12:57 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  That makes sense. Cool. Okay, so yeah, just make sure that... Understand it before you jump into the price part.  And then, yeah, the way you've written that is perfectly fine.

1:13:11 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  Cool. And will we take, this is mainly for my knowledge, Athena. Yeah. Do we take the fee from the proceeds of the loan, or is that due at the signed agreement?

1:13:38 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So in order for us to be SBA compliant, we cannot set the milestone as contingent on the loan. So technically, it's owed to us whether they get the loan or not.  But we can be paid that 30K from the loan proceeds. So we'll say like, it's due to us at the time of signing.

1:14:00 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  But we will wait until the loan closes to be paid from you. But we can't put that in the agreement.

1:14:08 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Otherwise, it's not SBA compliant.

1:14:11 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, that makes sense. That makes sense. So they need to understand they're on the hook for it, whether the loan closes or not.  Yeah, I follow.

1:14:21 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  But if they're signing a purchase agreement, they've gotten through the underwriting stages and commitment letter and everything. So if they're signing a purchase agreement, there's a 99.9% chance the loan is closing at that point.

1:14:39 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  Yeah. Cool. Yeah, that's easy. That's easy. And thank you for all the feedback today and hopping on those calls and watching me give it the whole college try.

1:14:52 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  appreciate that. You're doing great. Yeah, like I feel comfortable. You're on, you know, even without me on there. So I'm sorry that you're doing an exploration call without me, but I think you're going to do great.  It might make it easier to just, like, go through the flow, and I think you'll learn things. And, you know, my biggest worry is, not worry, but just on the, you know, the point that your other bosses were condescending and that sort of thing.  Like, it would break my heart if people thought we were. So even if they're, like, okay, it's really expensive, a lot of them are, like, look, I completely see the value.  I think you're great. I've enjoyed the conversation. It's just, like, too much for me. I'm, like, that's cool. Like, I don't think anyone's ever left the sales conversation being, like, I mean, they might be a little, like, two to four, it's not enough, whatever.  But like, you know, they don't have enough experience to know and that's fine. And, you know, I didn't demonstrate the value, but like, you know, I'm talking to Elliot Holland, who's been doing this for 15 years, and he's like two to four qualified deals.  He's like Athena. Like, yeah, they just don't understand, right? They're first time buyers that have never done this. And the internet's telling them that they can do it in a couple months.  And they're like, wait, you do on market, like, but I need off market. That's the, you know, better deals are there.  then I keep putting off market deals in front of people, and they bottle it because they can't walk people through the process.  So, but Chris is about to make a $5 million offer on and off market if we worked for a year before we got it in front of him.  Like, it just takes time, you know? So.

1:16:53 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  I, I'm not too concerned for this, you know, like, that's, I'm like, I, it was the reason that I left Ivy, right?  It's like, I didn't enjoy that environment. And like, I'm like, dude, like, I like to like, have fun with what I'm doing on a day to day basis.  And like, I don't enjoy like, like, having to like, bring somebody down or like be condescending towards somebody. And like, it was like a major factor in why I left that role, Athena.  So like, I, it's not like, it's like, here's what I'll say. It's like, it's something that like, I'll probably have to focus on it.  And it would be extremely helpful to have coaching on. But like, I don't think it's like, something necessarily like, overly difficult to shift, right?

1:17:38 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Like, unlearning and then also learning my secret sauce for it, right? Like, I, um, one thing Ryan said, it was like, to the team once, he's like, you guys got to listen to Athena, because the way she talks to clients, like, I've never heard anyone talk to clients.  Yeah, I can't do it. But I've been In client servicing roles for 25 years, you know, I'm friends still.  Jim was like, I work for him. He wasn't necessarily a direct client, but I'm still friends for clients, you know, from 20 years ago.  Like I've just, there's a way to set boundaries and expectations and go into coaching mode where it's not like you're not a pushover, you know, like I manage people's expectations hard.  So that when things happen, it's like, I didn't, it's not that I didn't prepare them for how it is, like whether they listened or not, right?  So if you think of yourself as a coach and a consultant in these calls, right? Like, what does this person need?  What do they need to solve? What are they not seeing? How can I help them achieve their potential? Or how can I help them spot a blind spot?  That's kind of how I view it, right? Like, if this was a coaching call, and they... Could unlock their potential by choosing to make this decision to invest in themselves.  What do I need to do or say to get them to see that and feel like, okay, I'm  scared, but like, I'm ready, you know, and Peter, our newest client, like he was like, talked, we talked six months ago, and then he came back and he's like, he's like, Athena, love everything about this, but writing a 30k check.  And I was like, look, if you didn't pay a lot of money, you wouldn't be bought into this and you're not going to take it seriously.  So it's like, I'm doing you a favor because if I pay 30 grand for something, I'm making the most of it and I'm doing everything I need to do.  And then when he signed the agreement and sent the check, he's like, wrote us and he's like, I'm shaking right now.  I was like, I know it's scary. You made a big commitment in yourself and we got you, you know, like, that's the feeling that I want.  It's like, we were helping them, like, get over their fear and like, take the next step. And then. Do you know the hero's journey?

1:20:02 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  I'm like familiar with the concept, but like I haven't read the book now.

1:20:07 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  I mean, that changed marketing for me like overnight, right? Because like most brands or people position themselves as the hero.  And once you like, I picture myself like a fairy godmother, right? Like I need to help Cinderella. Or when I originally started using this analogy, was Star Wars.  And I'm like, I never watched Star Wars until a couple years ago. So whoever you identify with is like, who's the guide in a movie that helped the hero, you know, either prevent catastrophe or achieve their potential, right?  That's who we are in this process. And as salespeople too, because like sales isn't selling, it's solving a problem for someone.

1:20:47 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, 100%.

1:20:49 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So how, what do they need to like unlock in themselves to be able to, like, we know that this will solve their problem, but they don't see it yet.

1:20:56 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  So we have to guide them there. Yeah, I follow, I follow what you're saying. Yeah. Like I said, I'm definitely open to feedback.  I don't claim to know everything by any means and appreciate all the strong recommendations you've made so far. So like I said, it's well received on my side and not something that I'm necessarily concerned about, Athena.

1:21:20 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  I'm not either. think you'll, once you get comfortable with the script and the product, like you'll  nail it. And that's what I loved about your responses in the interview and like both the, you know, the text and like the way that you handled the objections.  Cause that's, that's where like, man, if it's in a coaching scenario and there's not money on the line, like I can do that.  You know, I'm really good at like asking the hard questions, but for whatever reason, just bottle it when it comes to sales or I don't know how to like, how to ask the questions to get them to arrive at the solution.  So like between your experience and superpowers and me just layering on some things. You know, special sauce in terms of how we do it.  Like, you're gonna  kill it. You already are.

1:22:05 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  Yeah. I'm like, again, like, to your point, like, sales is very nuanced, but like, you have to have that, like, initial base to be able to like, start customizing.  And like, really, I'm like, there's the concept of like, talking at someone talking to someone and then talking with someone.  And then like, in the beginning, like, you're, I'm like, I'm reading a script and very much talking at someone and not necessarily like talking to them specifically.  Eventually, I'll get to the point where it's like, hey, and like, fairly quickly, I think that half will happen is like, okay, now I'm able to talk to you specifically, and like, who you are as an individual and like, be able to customize this to like, the person on the other side of the screen for me.  And then the final stage, which I have, like, somewhat of a hard time with, especially with like, lengthy scripts like this is like, how do we make this like, we're talking with someone, right?  We're like, daring. Gauge throughout that entire sales deck, and it's like a meaningful conversation and not just like a one-sided monologue, and I think that's going be the harder component.

1:23:10 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, go get it, though. Just practice.

1:23:12 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, 100%.

1:23:14 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Nice. Okay, well, I'll leave you to it for the prep for Devin.

1:23:20 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  Send me a little note, if you don't mind, after. Let me know how it goes.

1:23:24 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  And then we'll catch up this afternoon and dive deeper into this stuff. I'll share the intro script in the meantime, if you get a chance to read through it before.
  ACTION ITEM: Script "Trusted by industry leaders" and "Get signed LOI results" slides + testimonials section - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/289856662?timestamp=5012.9999  I'm going to try to record a video talking through it, but I'll see where I get through today with my other stuff I've got going on.

1:23:39 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, I'm like, you've got a bunch of stuff on your plate, so don't worry about it. Maybe last question is, do you want me to script out the, because there's two slides that we have left that I don't have scripted.  Like, one's trusted by industry leaders, and then the second is get signed LOI results, and then the testimonials component.

1:24:00 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, might as well, just so, like, you're like, this is what I gathered from your videos, is this the right track?  So, yeah.

1:24:08 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  Cool, cool. Yeah, I'll try to have you back to today, Athena. Okay, awesome. Okay, thing in the morning, so.  Great. Perfect. Thanks, Austin. You too. Bye.
