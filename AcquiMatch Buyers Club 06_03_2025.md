# AcquiMatch Buyers Club 06/03/2025

[00:00:00] 

**Athena:** So I wanted to kick off Gil, if you're comfortable doing an update. 'cause I think it's interesting what you've been through and then we can talk through, uh, where you're at, if you don't mind sharing. I think it's good learnings for everybody too, like the different fees and comparing term sheets and stuff like that.

Um, I don't mind sharing 

**Gil:** how deep do want me to get, because that could be the entire hour. Yeah. 

**Athena:** So, um, so gill's under LOI, we knew that he went and did the site visit. I, I think actually talking through the, the moment that you had about questioning the, you know. The, the, what we talked about, like is, is this something that's overcomeable or not?

That was a pretty big moment and I think there's good learnings there. And then talking through getting the term sheets and managing that. Like you were speaking to four different lenders at some point. So all of that's really good [00:01:00] learnings because you're also doing a deal that has real estate in it.

So there's different things that are coming up in that term sheets, what the lenders are questioning, the relationships between the lenders and the broker and yourself and that sort of thing. So, uh, tell us a little bit first about like, you know, you had a, a moment where you were questioning like, is this a deal for me or not?

And is this challenge that I'm seeing overcomeable? Um, 'cause I think that's useful. 

**Gil:** Yeah. So, uh, I had a site visit. I went down to, uh, the office slash warehouse that, that, that's down, uh, right outside of Philly. It took me about. Two hours to get there and about two and a half hours to come back. Um, and that was challenging.

Uh, it was a hard drive. It was night, it was raining. It's, uh, the back roads in, uh, Pennsylvania until you hit the, until hit the highway. And during the, it was dark. It was, it was a mess. Um, and I was thinking, do I really wanna spend four and a half hours [00:02:00] on a car on a daily basis, um, doing this? And is it worth it?

Uh, I was, I didn't know the answer to that. Uh, speaking with Athena, she recommended that I actually find out more details as to why does the seller actually come to the office? What does she do in the office? And get a better. Job description for her. So I drove there again. Um, and on the second visit we sat down and I went through her daily tasks one by one by one by one.

Realized there is little to no reason for her to be there. Actually. Uh, everything she does can be done remotely. The entire operation is extremely paper-based and one of my backgrounds in it, in digitization, I can digitize it, uh, so I can have access and view into everything that's happening. Uh, but right now, the only reason she's actually needs to be there is when her [00:03:00] people ask her her opinion about things.

Like, Hey, can you take a look at this? Hey, can you take, can you take a look at that? Um, so. She tells me that they ask her those questions because they're not sure, but they always have the right answer. So the team there is really, really strong. Uh, and I believe that I can get, get away with initially being there every day, obviously during transition.

But after that, uh, meeting her, me, me meeting the team and on a daily basis virtually, uh, having one-on-ones virtually and then going down there maybe once or twice a week, and that's definitely doable. Um, there's also the cost of the tolls. It's a 20 something dollars in tolls and half a tank of gas and all these different things.

Uh, so that was the first hurdle that I had to overcome. Uh, and I think I talked about this, I think last week with your back against the wall, you know, what do you do? And, uh, we talked through, we talked [00:04:00] out and that that's what I did and worked. So I said, okay, next step, continue with the deal. So just 

**Athena:** if I can build on some of the cool things that came out of that and some of the, the solutions that Gil came up with.

Like, you know, he was like, I don't know, like this, and this feels like this deal isn't gonna work for me. And I was like, well, all things considered, like, is this the only thing giving you pause? Is it only the commute and everything else you love? And he's like, it's only the commute. And I was like, okay, so let's brainstorm some options to see if that's overcomeable.

And one of the, the solutions that he came up with, which I really like, is he is like, well, what if I'm in it for a year, a year and a half and I still, you know, doesn't look like it's something that can be done. Could I move the location? Like, I think that's a great solution. 'cause he is gonna own the property in the warehouse and it's like maybe the core team could move closer to him and the warehouse is there, you know, so thinking through the like, well what could make this work for me?

If there's only one thing [00:05:00] and it's not like fraud or the money, is it there, you know, something horrible about the deal and you're loving it otherwise, then is there a way to overcome it? So Gil came up with some great solutions there and, and also his background is, you know, building and running remote teams.

He knows how to have that kind of culture and to keep that alive and that sort of thing. So he is uniquely qualified to be able to do that with a team. They might really like having some hybrid work too. You know, maybe they don't feel like they need to come in every day and deal with paper folders. So, not that he's gonna change it initially on day one, but there's, there's opportunities there that are, are, you know, his skillset to be able to do those sorts of, of transitionary.

So 

**Gil:** I actually asked her point blank, uh, why didn't you ditch take the process? And she said that if she would've delayed the selling of the business another year, it would've been this summer's project. So it is [00:06:00] possible, and there is, uh, a want to do that, to do that amongst her team as well. Great. So looking forward to doing that.

Yeah. Awesome. Um, so then the next step, the next step is getting term sheets. Uh, the broker introduced me to two bankers. Um, one, they, they were both extremely responsive initially. Um, there was one, uh, from a bank called Berkshire. He was calling me two or three times a day. Asking me questions, um, going very, very deep into the numbers of the p and l, uh, going very deep into all the add-backs.

And, uh, I, I, I appreciated his input. He had a lot of really good input, really good questions and questions that if this deals falls through for some reason or other, I know that next time I go to do, to do a deal, I'll be much more well armed and know what to ask for before I go to the banks. [00:07:00] Okay. And that is having a very good understanding of exactly how the business runs, having, uh, the, uh, the cash flow from inception of a client all the way through the bank and, and, and paying everything, uh, and understanding every single add back to its nth degree and its paper trail.

Um, so those are things that, that I took with me from the conversations with him. Uh, after all the back and forth, he also asked for a lot of documentation from the sellers herself. She was very kind. She responded very quickly, and I got her all the documentation. Um, and eventually I ended up being, getting a term sheet from him.

Now, the other banker that the broker introduced me to, she has been pushing me and pushing me and pushing me, delaying a meeting with me, delaying a meeting with me. She finally got back to me, uh, yes, two days ago on Sunday night, said, am I here on Tuesday? I said, [00:08:00] yes. Last night at nine 30. She emails me, can you do Wednesday?

So she keeps on pushing this out. If she doesn't want my business, she doesn't want my business. I'm not gonna push it to, I'm, I'm, I'm not pushing her. I'm not, I'm not, I'm not reaching out to her, uh, uh, myself. Um, Athena introduced me to two, uh, bankers. Uh, one was with a bank called, uh, I've forgotten where Jared's from.

Uh, 

**Athena:** oh, first internet. 

**Gil:** First internet, okay. Uh, and then one from City National. Um, the, the guy from, uh, uh, this Jared guy, he asked for information initially, uh, that was very, very, very deep. He asked for a business plan before he even started talking to me, and I did not want to, I'm assuming a sample of what those business plans should look like.

I, I've seen these things before and it's not something that can be written in a, in, in half an hour or even a day. This, this takes a lot of thought. It takes, and I didn't wanna go down that rabbit hole if I can't get the [00:09:00] financing. So I didn't wanna put all that work in without knowing that I can actually get a term sheet.

So I worked with the other banker from, uh, city National Bank and, uh, going back and forth a few times, uh, again, questions about the add-backs. He got me a term sheet as well. Uh, looking at the two term sheets, they are similar, but different, you know, same, same, but different. Uh, one because there's real estate involved, then the loan is for a longer period than 10 years.

Uh, one's for 15 years, one's for 16 years. The interest rate is different back quarter of a percent. But that changes on a quarterly, which, which changes on a quarterly basis, uh, according to the prime, uh, according to the prime rate. Um, they, one, the, the, the banker from Berkshire asked me to Retrade the seller note.

He wanted a bigger seller note. Uh, initially, uh, not initially. He, he wants a bigger seller note basically because he wants to [00:10:00] circumvent a issue of customer concentration. I don't know how a non unforgivable seller note circumvent that, but that's what he wants, so. Okay. Um. There were a few other changes that went, went on, uh, with Athena's, uh, help, uh, redid the model, uh, turned the no change into one bank, change the, change the best case into another, into another, into another bank.

And compared the two, comparing the two, uh, the difference was not that great. Um, so I was trying to think, okay, which banker I wanna work with? Uh, and I finally came to the conclusion that I wanna work with the guy from City National. I came to the conclusion about, I'd say, four or five hours ago, and now I wanna move forward with him.

So I have a few open questions for you, Athena, uh, as you heard from my voice note on Slack. Yep. And, uh, yeah, that's about it. I, I can go into more details if you want me to. I'd be more than happy to. [00:11:00] 

**Athena:** Yeah. I, I, I think that's, um, good. And also you spoke to Live Oak on this one too, so 

**Gil:** I 

**Athena:** forgot about 

**Gil:** Yeah.

Live Oak also said, I spoke to Live Oak and they said, uh, no, because of the customer concentration, 

**Athena:** right. Which, uh, according to the seller, the customer concentration is like four different cost centers within one company. Yes. So there's like four different, like pos or, or responsible people for those budgets.

So somebody see that differently. My oak is pretty conservative when it comes to customer concentration service from the same company. Then they get, you know, uncomfortable with it. So the, I think this is a really good demonstration of like, why to talk to a bunch of different lenders. Also, Gil was paying, playing the brokers game, right?

By speaking to his lenders, which he started the process. Pre LOI Brokers can sometimes get weird if they don't, you know, if they're, if it looks like they're not gonna get their referral fee from the lender. Um, [00:12:00] so like keeping 'em on the hook and being like, yeah, of course I'll speak to your lenders and everything.

And, and as far as we're concerned, it's like we want y'all to work with the person that you feel is best suited for you. So then when you have two term term sheets where. It's pretty similar in terms of like overall costs for it. There's some, some elements of toy that I liked 'cause it gives you a better run at cash flow in the first couple months.

Also, he's, he's fine with your structure. That's not really like when the banker's trying to get you to retrade your seller note and stuff like that, that just before you even get a term sheet that's kind of complicating things like let's wait for the QV and a little bit more di diligence for them to do that.

Um, so yeah. It sounds like you've had a better working relationship with uni throughout this process as well. He is also familiar with us and, and he's a huge advocate of what we do and how we support buyers also. So like, there's not gonna be that conversation of how the fees fit in and that whole thing.

Like, and they've, we know that they've [00:13:00] closed with clients. They closed on, um, Lindsay's deal. Um, so. The questions were, when, when you get the term sheets, there's uh, like they'll make estimations of what the potential closing costs are gonna be. Now, when you bring in real estate, there's some things that come up, like, you know, potentially getting a valuation there.

An environmental study, that sort of thing. That's all additional out-of-pocket costs that you'll have to pay while buying the real estate. Um, but you can package it all into the loan. Um, so yeah, why don't you outline your, um, specific questions and we can talk through that. 'cause I, I think this is helpful for everybody to just hear this process of walking through it with the lender, the things that come up at various stages.

Also, every lender is completely different. Um, and one thing that Tooney does is he includes the business valuation, right? Like he does that early on to make sure that Yeah. So he, um, he does a vis business valuation early on [00:14:00] so that he knows that what he is offering can actually be funded because the SBA has in, in their SOP that a lender cannot lend more than the business is valued at.

So if the business valuation comes back a lot lower, the, the lender can't, and you're like, well, I wanna pay a higher purchase price. They can't do that. So, um, so that's another, another thing that they do. But yeah. What are, what are your specific questions on how to move forward at this point? 

**Gil:** So, uh, my questions are, because Tooney, uh, in his term sheet put in a lower amount for, uh, the closing costs.

And when I talked to him today, he agreed, yeah, that, that, that was too low. Um, and that's one thing, uh, do I ask for a new term sheet or do I sign this with a knowledge that, hey, it's gonna cost me more. We just don't know exactly how much, but I, I, but, but I know it's gonna cost me. 

**Athena:** Yeah. And 

**Gil:** the other thing that I didn't, that I did not talk to him about, because it just slipped my mind when he called me, [00:15:00] uh, called me back was the line of credit.

So is that part of the term sheet or is that a discussion that has to happen afterwards? 

**Athena:** Yeah. Good. Great questions and this is, this is like beneficial for everybody. So I personally, like whenever I'm signing to have the things that I expect to be in there so that you just have something like, and the term sheet, signing the term sheet is like no guarantee of the structure or funding or anything, right?

Not until you get that commitment letter. Are you like signing on the dotted line with the bank? Um, so my personal preference is if I'm signing something, I want everything to be in there that I am expecting to be in there. So when you guys do the financial model, like that's a really strong document to send to the lenders and show like, Hey, I'm not just like making this number up or looking at debt service coverage ratio.

Like here's how I calculated this. Here's all the projections that I have. So it gives them another vote of confidence, but also they can reflect the additional fees that you're [00:16:00] putting in there. So like for example, our model will automatically calculate 5% of your deal. As additional deal costs. Um, so you are arriving at that debt service coverage ratio by having, you know, our costs in there, the deal costs in there.

So as long as you show them that model and be like, this is how I'm calculating it, this is what I'm estimating for deal costs, uh, to include the acqui match fee. Um, this is, you know, how I'm structuring it. Here's a line of credit that I think it could handle. What do you think? Then they're like, oh wow, you've really done your work.

So what I would say is you want toy to verify that could you structure handle that additional amount of deal costs? 'cause it's gonna push the whole project cost up. So you wanna make sure that's okay. And then also say, you know, I would love at least a $250,000 line of credit. [00:17:00] Could I get more than that and still, you know, meet your parameters there.

You wanna kind of ask for as much as you possibly could get because you're not, you're not paying interest on it until you pull it down. But it's a pocket of money that's there and available to you if you need it, if shit hits a fan, or if you start going in the Jake, or which you will. Right? So Max, I think you can ask for line of credit is like 500.

Um, and they will usually outline it in the term sheet. So what they wanna look at, they'll have their own parameters for how they calculate debt service and that whole thing with the line of credit. So I, you know, put, when we were doing it, it looked like it could probably do two 50. So I would just send, add that in, send it to him and be like, you know, here's, here's what I was modeling.

I'd love at least two 50, but you know, if there's room for more, I'd love more. What do you think? And then also, here's the deal costs that I'm estimating. Do you think that's a robust enough number to cover everything that I'm potentially gonna be looking at? Um, [00:18:00] and uh, are you okay with that? Like do your, does it still work?

And then can we get the term sheet updated before I sign it? Yeah, I think that's just good practice. If you sign something, you kind of want it to be updated. And also then you're having that conversation up front, especially about line of credit. So that, 'cause they're gonna have to go to their, their team and have that conversation internally to also get that approved to you.

It's not just like a oh, easy thing to add in there. They're gonna have to re recalculate and make sure it works. And then also with all those deal costs, does that structure that he offered you, do those terms still work? If you have 5% in there, that should likely cover everything that you need. Um. So that's what I would say is like just go back to him with the model and say like, Hey, hoping for at least two 50, could we put more in there?

And everything still work and here's what it, you know, but like, I'd like to make sure that the estimated deal costs will still work with the terms that you put [00:19:00] together. Ask him if he thinks that it should be added in or not. You know, 

**Gil:** I can do that. Yeah. Um, I sent them the, the model already, it had 200 in it, it got two 50.

But I think that, you know, I, I, I can talk to 'em about two 50. That's not a problem. Um, 

**Athena:** I mean, say like, could I get 500? Like, should be like this, this business has a pretty long cash flow cycle. Like, you know, I think I'm, you know, we're, we're gonna be going through qv, making sure there's enough working capital, the whole thing.

But obviously like having that cushion makes me feel better. So like, what's the max that, that we could do? 

**Gil:** Yeah. 

**Athena:** Okay. 

**Gil:** Um, yeah, I can do that and, uh, see what he comes back with. 

**Athena:** Awesome. Yeah, on his term sheet too, for, for everybody's, uh, benefit, he offered three months interest only too, which helps with the first couple months of cash flow and everything.

So I think I, I like seeing that. Um, 'cause the first couple months will you, you just don't know what's gonna happen when you [00:20:00] get in there and what you need to pay and how long it's gonna take for cash to come, or, or if you get like, you know, there's the whole setting up new bank accounts and dah, dah, dah, dah.

And then you gotta get on the new vendor lists at these companies if you're doing an asset sale versus a keeping the same bank accounts. So you just never know what kind of disruptions you can have in the first couple months. So having a little bit, it's, you know, the interest only, um, interest is pretty high in the beginning anyway, so it's, it's, you know, the difference of not a huge amount of money monthly, but it, it helps.

So, um, any, any little help you can get in the beginning I think is a, a good thing. Um, 

**Gil:** yeah. Yeah. Most. Um, and the other thing was, 

**Athena:** uh, oh, I wanted to talk through the broker and the QV conversation that you were having. Was that what you wanted to talk about? 

**Gil:** No, the next point. Yeah. 

**Athena:** Yeah. Give us [00:21:00] a, just a quick synopsis on this.

Brokers. He is, he is like, he gets pretty like, mean brokery on GI regularly, it feels like. 

**Gil:** Um, he called me today, uh, because he didn't make our weekly meeting. Uh, so he just called me and, uh, I gave him an update about, Hey, I have term sheets. I'm looking in, I'm, I'm doing production modeling on them. I'll, I'll, I'll know later on this week.

Uh, I told him that I talked to my Q review provider. I talked to Chris. Um, and he said, and he said that, uh, he needs four weeks to do a QE. You know, it could be quicker, but he doesn't guarantee anything quicker. Uh, because the broker did ask me that beforehand, after I said that, the broker said, well, we're pretty firm the price, so whatever the QE comes up, we're gonna say we're gonna stick to this price.

And I said, well, let's see what the QV brings up first. If the books are clean and everything's good, we're good. [00:22:00] If not, we'll have to, we'll have a conversation and, uh, we'll take it from there. So that's how I left it with him. He said, okay. And, uh, yeah, move on, we'll move forward. 

**Athena:** That's, um, I think you, you, you said the right thing, right?

Like you're buying a, you know, it's like gonna be a $3 million personal guarantee kind of deal, right? And so. Brokers. It's either coming from one of two places. One, and I think this is him. I think he's very time sensitive because like brokers, when they set up whatever arrangement with the seller, they don't get paid until the deal closes.

So if they've been working on a deal for a really long time and they're starving and they haven't been fed, then they want the deal to close as quickly as possible so they can get paid. So I have a feeling just because he's so, like sense of urgency all the time and his like pushback on the amount of time for diligence and that whole thing, it's, it's probably that [00:23:00] pushing back on getting diligence though, it's like, well, what do you not want me to find?

And you said exactly the right thing. Like, if everything checks out, then we're good. Like, I'm doing this so I, you know, I know what I'm buying and I have confidence that I'm walking into something that's not gonna bankrupt me. That's it. Like, 

**Gil:** yeah. 

**Athena:** So I, I suspect it's a timing thing, and it usually is, and it's one of the many reasons I complain about the, the brokerage business model.

It's like, if you're only working for a success fee, then you're doing things like this and trying to rush along the process because you need to get paid for. Like, seller doesn't seem like she's in that massive of a rush. She just wants you in there for the busy season, which I've seen people in diligence.

If the diligence is taking longer and it's looking like everything's good and it's checking out, you just start going, doing the handover before you close. 

**Gil:** Yeah. Um, the busy season is her. She has two busy seasons, uh, February, March, April kind of [00:24:00] thing, and, uh, September, October kind of thing. So, uh, I ideally like to get there in August so I can be there for the busy season and I can get the profits from the busy season.

Uh, I don't wanna step get there in. You know, uh, October or at the end of October, all the AR goes to her and December's a dead is a, is a dead month, and I still have to pay, uh, Toni his, uh, his interest. 

**Athena:** Right? Um, so yeah, I mean, you, you got quite a bit of time, uh, before the busy season, but if for any reason it, it drags on, then I've just seen people do that where they arrange to start doing the handover.

And going in person while you're working through the details helps you build rapport, you know, have more confidence in the business, that whole thing. So, um, if, if that's the seller's main concern, is the busy season, that's a reasonable thing, and that can be overcome just by y'all [00:25:00] meeting more frequently.

Towards the end of it. If, if you're still waiting to like dot all the i's and cross all the T's and some of this stuff, some of those negotiations that you're gonna have to have, you probably wanna do that in person when it gets further down the line. Like if there's big swings in the working capital and or if there's big things that come up that you need to talk to her about.

So 

**Gil:** do I talk to her or do I talk to the broker or do I talk to both of 'em simultaneously? Is he, is he local to 

**Athena:** her? Yeah. Can he come and meet in person? 

**Peter:** Yeah. 

**Athena:** So it depends on when you get further down the, he might, he might trail off once there's a commitment letter, right? Once a Q of E comes back and there's a commitment letter and he's like, sure.

That, or he might stay actively involved through the end of seeing like different things happen with their involvement. Once they know it's gonna close, then it's like, okay, I can chill out a little bit. Um, so. On the, on the, the weekly meeting, you know, then I would say [00:26:00] like, I'd really like to come and discuss some of this stuff in person.

I just think it's better. Like, Mr. Broker, would you like to be there also? Yeah. And if he's like, I can't make it, then it's like, okay, well I, I, I wanna have this conversation in person. I don't wanna do this virtually because this is, this is a real, this is a really important discussion for all of us to have.

So you give them, give him a right of refusal, basically. 

**Gil:** Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Well that's of question that Wanna get to it? First of all, let's, uh, get this term sheet signed. 

**Athena:** Yay. That's super exciting, bill. 

**Gil:** Very excited. Are you 

**Athena:** excited? Multiple term sheets. So lenders have looked at it. We're good. We've overcome the, and, and, um, so the, all of you will go through this when you go through these deal processes, like something like, you know, for Gil it was a commute.

It's gonna be different for all of you. Something's gonna come up where it's gonna like the. Part of your brain that's like, don't do this. It's scary. We'll make it seem like. This is a big deal. So before you blow up deals, like come and have a chat with me or the [00:27:00] team, right? And we can, we can just be that, that mirror and like reflect things back at you and talk through things.

And like if it genuinely is a deal, like it's a dead deal. We don't want to like push you on it. But if it's something you love and it's something that can be overcome, we, I've seen this with every single client and every person I know that's gone through an acquisition. There's gonna be a moment where you like, and maybe multiple moments as you go through the process where it just feels like this is a deal killer, you know?

And, and oftentimes it's a deal adjustment versus a deal killer. So, um, yeah, feels really good at being open to, to brainstorming and that sort of thing. So that's what I'd say is like the resiliency and the problem solving is like, it's a good start to do it during this process because when you get into business ownership, you also have to do a lot of problem solving and, and finding solutions there too.

So, um. Cool. Thanks for sharing. Gil. Does anyone have questions for Gil about anything that he shared or any, anything you wanna double click [00:28:00] on? 

**Peter:** I have a, I have a quick question. 

**Athena:** Yeah. Um, 

**Peter:** and I guess it's related to customer concentration. Um, how are you designing around that? I guess I, I, I didn't really understand that whole piece and, um, 

**Gil:** the customer concentration happens with this.

Okay. She has this one large continent. One large client that constitutes, uh, in 20 24, 50 2% of her, of her revenue. Now it is, it's a software. It's a software group. And within that company there are sub uh, departments. There's a marketing department, there's an education department, there is a developing department, and they each have different pos that they send to her for work.

So, but when she bills, she bills the one client, she doesn't, but the pos themselves, and you can [00:29:00] see this in the account, in the, in the accounts, they have the different names on them. So they go to different people. That's number one. Number two, um, she also, uh, stores and warehouses, uh, the booths for the clients.

So they are not very quick to come and take. I'd say something about six or seven crates of things out of there and store it somewhere themselves. So there, there, there's a little bit of stickiness here and she just did a 100 by 100 booth for them. Uh, and uh, they just changed her logo three months ago, so everything is gonna change again now.

And she has all that work. So all that work's coming down and all the work is, is, is some of it's taking place already. So I am not that worried about the customer concentration. Uh, specifically in addition to that, she has done zero marketing. Everything she does is word of mouth and [00:30:00] my plan and those in my financial model as well is, uh, you know, 6, 7, 8, 9 months down the road once everything stabilizes and they can see how things are, hire a sales person to increase sales and then to dilute that percentage of the customer concentration.

**Peter:** Cool. Thanks for sharing. Go. 

**Athena:** Sure. Um, and then also Peter, I don't know if you're around for the start of this deal, but like the Gill's background is in it, and that's who this customer base is of this company. So he has a lot of like, I mean, decades of knowledge and also knows the end customer pretty deeply, and I imagine has a Rolodex of people he could potentially go out to too, because he was that person standing on the trade show floor back in the day.

So there, there's a nice strong like, uh, connector there from his background and, and his, you know, network and understanding them. And like I imagine he could be pretty pointed at [00:31:00] where he goes to once he understands the business in terms of who needs this. 

**Gil:** Yeah, just thinking about my LinkedIn, uh, contacts, I'm like, okay, I can, if, if I put a one post on LinkedIn, I can probably get a few sales already, you know?

**Athena:** Right. They're like, I'd rather work with Gill. Let's go. It's awesome. And the, the warehousing and storage, I think is, is, you know, I mean, I, I I'm sure everybody's come across a, like, self storage model and how sticky that is. And when people put stuff in storage, they do not wanna deal with getting it out.

Right. So not only does he do the work and do the event work for them, but they are storing and warehousing all of their stuff too. So the chances of them switching the suppliers, um, when they have all that stuff there, you know, it's like the, the same of like when you're, when you're in a storage container or when you're in a storage unit, like how often are you switching providers when you have stuff to store?

**Gil:** Right. 

**Athena:** Cool. Good. Good question, Peter. Um, [00:32:00] awesome. So, uh. Paul, I was gonna ask you if you had a chance to kind of review, there was a, a couple deal, or, sorry, before I do that, Gil, are you feeling complete? All your questions answered and next steps? 

**Gil:** Yeah, yeah. I know what I, I know what I'm gonna do. Uh, I need to text Toney.

He said that's the best way to reach him is text. So I'll ping him. Uh, maybe not today's five o'clock almost, but, uh, tomorrow, uh, morning and, 

**Athena:** uh, have another chat with him. That's a really good, like, that's a small thing that you just glossed over. But I think it's really important when you start engaging with people, lenders, QV providers, lawyers, et cetera, if you need timely answers from them.

I, I did this, you know, from a client servicing side, I was like, what's your preferred mode of communication? What's the easiest way to get ahold of you? Um, and then use their communication, because they might not be on top of their email, but like, super quick on text. So that's a great unlock that you just mentioned, Gill.

Like if you. To know that [00:33:00] like you, like a lender, you know that they're better at text message and you can just communicate on their, um, communication channel to get ahold of 'em. Like, Hey, I just emailed you something, right? Like, you don't need to send the whole email on text, but that's awesome. Great point.

Um, good. Okay. Keep us posted. We're excited for you. Cool. Thanks. Um, Polly, how are you doing? You had a bunch of deals to go through, so, um, and that was, so we changed the deal parameters a little bit, but you're still wanting to get the reps in, so how are you feeling about things right now? 

**Polly:** Um, I just, uh, I just got in touch with Luke and said to go ahead and move.

I had with the broker calls for that, um, e-commerce digital marketing company and also for the landscaping and you know, regardless if it's the right business for us, I think just. Having those calls with a broker and getting, you know, used to, to asking those series of questions, [00:34:00] which I've done with several brokers now at this point.

It's just such a great exercise to go through. So, um, I think, you know, we've made the decision that pretty much any deal that comes across our, our plate here, that we're gonna, you know, at least engage in that, that conversation with the broker. 'cause I don't think you can really, I mean, unless it's just something that is just, I don't, you know, which, you know, what our deal box is and so, you know, unless it's something that's just really not something we want to even engage in conversation with the broker about, I mean, I think it's just important to go ahead and have that broker call to see where, yeah.

So it's in good practice. So, um, yeah, so we'll those two deals will definitely move forward with, um. The, uh, Steve and I haven't had a chance to really talk about the digital [00:35:00] marketing company out of Fort Lauderdale yet, and, and we we're not feeling, um, not, not feeling super strong about that right now, but need to definitely revisit it so we can figure out if that's something that we want to proceed with.

So, um, we'll have a chance to go over that hopefully this evening. He's been buried in work since he got back yesterday or since we got back Sunday. He was very busy yesterday, but that is something we need to have a conversation with so we can see where the next steps are with that. 

**Athena:** Awesome. That's, um, I love the mindset on that because there's so much.

Like having those broker conversations, navigating the different questions that they have of you having to position yourself, how you ask those questions. Like it sets you up so much for success when you do get a deal that you're really interested in. So just take note, everyone, like, um, if we put a deal in front of you, we believe there's something there worth having the conversation.

And even [00:36:00] if you're kinda on the fence about it, having that conversation can either give you practice on how to have those conversations, or it might show you something that you, you didn't see in the writeup and you get excited about the deal. That happens quite a bit actually. So, um, you know, I, I, I love that.

Um, and then what was the second part? Oh, I was gonna say, so on Thursday. For Buyer's Club, we have, um, Denise Montenegro who bought a landscaping business here in Texas in Dallas, and her and her partner had such a wild ride with this business. They did everything right. They hired the SMB law group, like, and just all sorts of things happened afterwards.

Now, I haven't heard about this happening to everybody, but like the worst case scenario for them on a couple different points happened, right? The things we fear the most when we [00:37:00] take over a business happened to them and they stuck with it and they found solutions and got really like. You know, it's a happy, looks like a happy ending.

It's a start of a happy ending after all of that. So, um, I'd love all of you to join. They have been asked by Will to come on the podcast multiple times. They won't do it. Like, so this is a conversation you're gonna get that nobody else gets. Nash. Also, when we had him on, he wouldn't go on the podcast. So, um, you said landscaping, so I just wanted to plug that, I mean, it's landscaping specific with what they're doing and how they're resourcing that.

I think a lot of us are thinking about, like, I. Those sorts of businesses, the workforce, the administration changes, like all of those sorts of things. So you can ask those kinds of questions too, like tactically about landscaping, but also hearing from them on like, literally the worst things that we imagined happened to them.

And they [00:38:00] got through it and it, it is just an amazing story. So she's gonna be here on Thursday. I'm so excited for that conversation. Um, so yeah, I was, I was, since you're talking about a landscaping business, I wanted to make sure that I pulled that one out. So, um, exciting. Okay. Cool. Anything else we can help you with, Polly?

**Polly:** No, not right now. I'm just trying to get caught up. I'm sure we'll be talking to you tomorrow about. Uh, you know, all of this a little more in depth. I want to see how quickly I can get those broker calls set up with the two I just mentioned. 

**Athena:** So nice. Yes. Timeliness. Is that what we're working on now?

Getting things? Yep. Yes. Um, it, it, every day y'all, it gets more and more competitive out there. More and more people are finding out about business buying so that the quicker you can respond and jump on those opportunities when we send them to you, uh, the more chances of, of your success. We usually pick 'em up kind of early on.

Um, and then also the team's gonna start [00:39:00] chasing you a little bit more. So you're gonna hear more from us if, if it's taking you some time to respond to things. So I'm excited about that friend friendly chases, but we want your success. So that's why we're chasing. 

**Polly:** No, that's, that's a good thing. And, and now since we've just made the decision that really, you know, I just said to Steve today, I said, I think that we just.

We just move ahead with the first broker call no matter what it is. So I think that helps right there. Speed up the process. So then Luke can just say, okay, I'm just gonna go ahead and make the introduction. So great. 

**Athena:** I love that. Removing the decision fatigue and the decision debt too. So this was a concept that I learned actually from Leela.

Um. And it was a pretty profound realization for me, and I don't know if I've talked about it on these sessions yet, but uh, like every decision you're not making is basically building up debt. Debt, you know, so like you have all these decisions you need to make in your personal life, business career, whatever.

And the decisions, we [00:40:00] delayed delay. We're just building up this debt and that debt can just take up a whole bunch of our brain space because even when we're not making the decision, we're thinking about the decision we need to make. Thinking about the decision, thinking about the decision. And I think you all probably can think of a decision that you made that you deliberated on for a really long time.

And the second you made it, it was just like, ah, clarity. Now I can think about something else. So, um, removing. The, the potential for decision debt like that, right? Like you've just decision fatigue. Like, do we do this, do we not? I ha I've made all these decisions today. Now I'm looking at my deals. At the end of my work day, I'm tired, right?

That's smart Polly. And it's just like, okay, we're moving forward no matter what. That's gonna kick things into gear. We're gonna have the broker call on that broker call if we don't like it. Then the worst case scenario is we got experience in having these conversations and learning more about deals in a different industry.

But you're also then keeping your decision debt low so you're not building up that debt of all [00:41:00] the, the deals that you potentially need to make decisions on in addition to all of the other things in your life that you're probably doing. But I try to make this at least a weekly practice, where I list out all of the things that I'm delaying a decision on, and I just make a decision like, okay, we're doing it today.

You have an hour, we're doing it. Yeah. And you give yourself that kind of timing. It's just like we're plowing through, okay, we are figuring out a couch today. No more time, one hour max. That's it.

**Polly:** It gets it done. That's the way to, that's the way you gotta do it sometimes, most times. So, yeah. 

**Athena:** But it's, it's, it's actually like given, given me a lot more calm in my life. You know? You don't realize how much that stuff's just like rolling around in your head and you're thinking about it, thinking about it, thinking about it.

So just making a decision and moving forward, um, or removing. The need to make a decision is also awesome. It's just like, okay, if it's there, we're gonna have a broker call. Love it. Yeah. [00:42:00] Nice. Paul. Okay. Well you have to fill us in on how that that tactic is working in the future when, uh, when you're having all the broker calls also, I just wanna call out.

Uh, you know, um, Paul and Steve have really worked hard on, um, their comfort level with a lot of this stuff. Like, it was, it was, it was a big lift to go from analyzing a deal to having a broker call, to having a seller conversation. It was, it was new and they wanted to get it right and. They pushed through the concern that they were gonna, you know, not necessarily have the call go well and just did it.

And now Polly's at the point where she's like, I don't even need Steve. I'm doing it on my own. You know, and, and leaves a really great impression with the seller. So like they're, they're also dividing up their resources and timeliness really well too, and pushing through some of that. So, um, it's been amazing to watch you guys go on that journey and your confidence level is so much higher from when [00:43:00] you started.

And that's because you kept pushing through the fear and the concern and taking these steps. 

**Polly:** Yep. All new, but you know, just facing it head on, I guess is the best way to 

**Athena:** do it. Yeah. Yes, absolutely. Um, Justin, I'm curious, have you heard back from any of the two? Nothing I. 

**Justin (2):** Uh, yeah. Uh, actually after this I did, uh, get in touch with the broker for the roofing company.

Uh, finally he said he was on vacation or whatever. Anyway, he said, uh, to, uh, contact him this afternoon. So after, actually, after I hop off this, I'm gonna give him a call and hopefully he answers 

**Athena:** like a feedback. One, one way or another would be good. Like, I mean, 

**Justin (2):** at this point it's been weeks, so I can't imagine like, you know, it's good news necessarily, but we'll see.

We'll see. Either way I, I'll get feedback 

**Athena:** or the thing that he was like not responding, he was taking his time, responding. You didn't play out. And now he is like, okay, now I can [00:44:00] talk to Justin. That 

**Justin (2):** also could be, he was like back pocketing me while they were working something else. Yeah, we'll, uh, we'll, we'll find out.

We'll, I'll get to the bottom of it and then, uh, yeah, so that's, uh, I do have, I guess, potential update there, you know, pending that chat and then, yeah, nothing back from that onsite with the commercial electric yet. 

**Athena:** Okay, cool. Um, well I'm excited to hear the update about the roofing. I really did love that one for you.

Oh, this is Gamora. She's, uh, finding something over there that she's interested in. They have figured out the, these dogs, like I have this door that has a ball bearing on it, and like she could like, boop her head into it and like smash through the door. So I put a 15 pound kettlebell in the door and she's so strong.

She's booping through a 15 pound kettlebell, so I need to find something heavier to lock the door or I just let her come in and, and have a little guest appearance. So, um, but with the, um, the [00:45:00] roofing one, I, I, you know, on deals that you like. When there's, you know, the broker's kind of trying to play this game of like getting the highest price, but then the highest price comes with all these terms and conditions, then the deal can come back as long as you're persistent.

Yeah. And letting 'em know you're still interested in there. So Justin's been touching base, touching base, touching base, touching base. Seller loved Justin. Justin was an individual buyer, so his terms are gonna be sometimes more favorable to a buyer that doesn't want to stay in the business for years and years to come because most strategics or private equity are gonna ask the seller to re remain in the business for two to five years.

Whereas an individual buyer might have a lower purchase price, but they're gonna make sure that that business isn't torn up because it's not to their benefit to do so. And then also they want the seller out so they can be the business owner. So sometimes [00:46:00] our weaknesses end up being our strengths in these deals, and they're gonna, you know, walk the line with like the higher price, higher price, higher price.

And then the seller just gets to the point where like, that doesn't sound good. So they might entertain a lower purchase price with more favorable terms. So I guess the, the moral of that story is Justin's been doing a really good job of staying persistent, you know, not, not annoying them, but just friendly and persistent.

I think you're doing like a weekly kind of touch in, is that the cadence that you're on? 

**Gil:** Yeah. Yeah. 

**Athena:** So that's a good, good tool and toolkit for everybody. If there's a deal you love and you dunno whether it's under offer yet or completely off the table, then just weekly friendly check-ins and making a great impression from the start.

So that's also what Justin did. Seller loved him, could see him in the business, could see him taking over the business. So that keeps Justin in the seller's mind, which means the broker has to keep Justin warm because the seller prefers Justin over everybody [00:47:00] else. Did I summarize that accurately? Yeah, fingers crossed.

**Justin (2):** That's exactly what's happening. So, yeah. We'll, we'll find out. I'm very curious. 

**Athena:** Fantastic. And everybody's back from holiday. So deal flow is looking like it's, uh, again, last week was a, we, we think the brokers were all off, so maybe he was legitimately on vacation that whole time. We'll see. I can't wait to hear the update tomorrow.

**Justin (2):** Good. Could be, could be. 

**Athena:** Awesome. Um, and Lindsay, I saw you popped on. I know we have a conversation, uh, later. We can go into deep detail, but would, how would you, like, would you like to share a little bit about what's going on? I think it's a, a common thing that everybody faces when they're at this point.

Yeah. In the process. 

**Lindsay:** I joined 'cause I actually was like, you know what, I'll ask the group this question instead of leaving you to do all the answering Athena. But, um, so my husband and I are in the, we're putting together our first LOI, um, and using the calculator of course to help do that. But, [00:48:00] uh, I left, you know, Athena note that we're gonna talk about a little bit later, but I.

Where we're finding ourselves kind of getting stuck is like, we're like totally guessing and more specifically in the forecast assumptions, um, in those two boxes, like your, your forecasted revenue and then forecasted, was it CapEx, I think? Um, or maintenance. I forgot which one. Yeah. Um, and I'm like literally putting zero for like, just literally putting random numbers in and I don't know.

And like Dustin's laughing at me. He is like, it's so specific, but I'm like, it's not, it's really random, but I don't, I'm just curious how others, if you've gotten to this point, like if that calculation to what has been your methodology for best worst case and no change, um, what have you used to kind of figure out what, what numbers you should, what percentages you should put in there?

Um, because we do it. And then I kind of flip over to [00:49:00] the, uh, the summary. I forget the tab. Tab that's called, but the, you know, hey, what can, what can we make? And it's not really wowing me. And I'm like, please tell me, maybe there's something that I'm not entering right? Or maybe this just business is too small.

I don't know. But, um, just curious if, if y'all have had the same kind of feeling and if you've taken some approach or methodology for feeling more comfortable or confident in what you're putting in there.

Athe, I guess, you know, if this, I can jump in. I was, I was saying 

**Athena:** Peter nod his head, so I don't know if he was like commiserating or if he had any thoughts having, having gone through this before or Peter, what you would've done in retrospect now that you bought one and, and looking back, like how would you model it now on like best.

Best case scenario, worst case scenario, no change scenario. 

**Peter:** Well, I, I think if I can, if I can [00:50:00] remember it was something like best case would I, look, I laugh at these numbers now 'cause it's like the reality is 

**Lindsay:** total wh such departure, 

**Peter:** right? Um, but I think I was like, oh, you know, best case would be, you know, you know, 10 to 12% year over year growth for the next five years.

Uh, you know, worst case scenario would be, you know, you know, 10% in, you know, in year two. And then maintaining at that level, uh, for the rest of the time, oh my god, the worst. And then flat too. Whatever I. Okay. How about the world just ended? Like, uh, it's 30%, like down, like in that like just, you got, you know, there's just been so many things that were in reality, much more severe than what I ever would've modeled on the downside and the upside, like that I model reality has even come close to that.

So, you know, I, I just, uh, and that's like the part [00:51:00] that's hard because even, even on this next round, I'm like, all right, well, you know, it, it's still a guess. I think I'm better than I was seven years ago, but, you know, most likely I'm not. And so I should probably, you know, factor in like that, uh, um, that I'm not.

One thing I didn't do with much rigor though, was like, all right. How are you actually going, like, whatever it is you model out on the upside, it's like, how are you actually gonna get it done? Like, for real? And like how real is that? Like if you say, okay, I'm gonna get to 10 to 12% growth year over year, it's like, how's that gonna happen?

Well, oh yeah, I'm just gonna hire a star salesperson. Like, that's not fucking real. Like, that's like, that's, that's about as dreamy as the number you put down as the upside, right? So like that's kind of where I think you could, yes, you can put down whatever, number one, yes, it's a guess, but it's almost like, okay, what's the, what are the actions that you're confident sort of are aligned [00:52:00] with that, you know, number that you're putting down that's to the upside, which I think is, can be less of a guess Downside gets weird, man.

'cause like, and, and you know, even like you just talked about, you know, there's somebody coming on on Thursday who's like, we went to hell and back. All right. Like that's an downside. 

**Athena:** Yeah.

Um, so yeah, I'll, I'll, I'll, I'll layer onto what Peter said. Everything is a guess, right? Like, that's why startups, they're like, you know, it's hilarious when they go out and raise money and they're making this like, ridiculous guess. Um, so the, the, what we've put in the like forecast assumptions is just standard, is kind of like, that's.

Around about the, you know, where you can start looking at the no change is really the one you want to pay attention to. Like, if, if nothing changes in this business, and let's say you can keep revenue and expenses the same, what's, what's the [00:53:00] cash flow to you? That free cash flow number, does that look enticing enough and does the debt service work?

And then you can start messing around with the deal structure. That's the one I focus on the most is the no change scenario. That's where I start with, do the numbers make sense? Is it enticing enough? Is the debt service coverage ratio healthy enough? Um, do I feel like there's enough money there for both to pay for me and give me fat on the bone if I wanna make any reinvestments into the business?

Then from there, the best case, I usually kind of go light on that. So like, um, I was listening, I think it was Alex Hermo going on this rant about people's projections the other day, and he is like, I. Well, the s and p 500 on average grows by 3% a year. So you're gonna be better than the best, like 500 businesses.

So where, where you can model like a pretty insane, like best case is like, let's say the, the seller has contracts that they've locked in. Or on best case is where that's where I'm gonna model out a performance [00:54:00] based note and like, okay, well I'll say like, what if we hit 10% growth first two years and I give them a performance based note based on that.

But if we don't hit it, you know, then I know that, that everything still works there. But like a 3% growth is. Pretty standard, you know, best case, right? And that's just like super conservative, best case. But that's how I look at things. And then worst case, what you want to do there is you wanna model out what's, what's the worst case scenario your business can handle before you can't pay the bills before it goes below one.

So that one, you're, you're messing around with that to see like, well, what's the wiggle room in my no change? Okay, I've got a no change scenario. I'm happy with. Now let me look at what I, if, if, if there, you know, I'm happy with the no change and I keep everything the same, apart from my assumptions. What's the worst that can happen before I can't pay the bills [00:55:00] anymore.

That's what I use the worst case for, is like, once I've got a no change that I'm happy with, then I model it around that to see like, well, if, if I'm. If, if there was like a 5% drop in revenue, like I'm bankrupt, you know, then it's like, oh, that's a little bit tight. Um, then the other thing that I would say is like the answers in the past, you know, that's one of the benefits of buying a business that has past performance is you can look at like what their growth or or drop has been over the last couple years.

And ideally as you go through the process and due diligence, you get more of a timeline of documents that you can ask for to see what their trends are. So at this stage, it's really like in a no change scenario, does this deal work? Is the debt service coverage ratio healthy? And does it excite you enough with what's left over?

If nothing else changes in the business, then best case scenario, you can do 3% growth. But if the seller's like selling you on the potential of the business, [00:56:00] put that in and model it around a performance note. Like, well, what if that actually happens? And then worst case. Can the, what can the business handle before, before we can't pay the bills?

And how much of a cushion does that give me? You probably wanna see at least 10% drop, you know, like at least a 10% drop in revenue and you're still okay. Um, or that line of credit, you know, adding in a line of credit helps you have some cash to kind of weather the J curve. So I think in the model we built it at like 10% drop in first two years and then no change in the three years following that.

Um, so does that help answer your question a little bit? And we can go through in the specifics on the model, we'll get the numbers up and look at your deal specifically, but that's a roundabout, like generalities for the benefit of everybody, right? Like how I kind of look at the, the modeling and the forecasting and in what order and what I'm looking for at each of those.

**Lindsay:** Yeah. The s and p 500 example [00:57:00] is a really good. Marker to use for your best case. That makes perfect sense. And then, 

**Athena:** yeah, I mean if there's no performance known incentives in it, then just putting a 3% growth rate, which is, is standard. This is what I see. Like most of the investors and banks be like, okay with, they're like, that's reasonable, you know, to get a 3% growth rate so long as you're not in an industry that's dying, right, or you're not coming off the back of like a drop, drop, drop, drop, and there's no way to get it back there.

Then if, if you're on a drop at the seller at a high note in the future, then that's where I would be layering in a forgivable performance base note. That, well, let's get you back to where you did before. So long as the industry itself isn't dying, but you're, if you're in an industry that's like, not, I was listening, I'm listening to this like AI podcast right now, which is so industry, it's like an episode on ai, but like legal work is basically gonna be eliminated in, in several years with [00:58:00] ai.

So like thinking about like, well, is the overall industry something that's growing, dying, or staying the same? And then do my, you know, as long as it's staying the same or it's growing in some way, then you're not working against the market trends there. And 3% is safe. Cool. 

**Lindsay:** Thank 

**Athena:** you. No worries. Good question.

Great questions. Nice to see you here too. Um, awesome. Well, I hope everybody can join for Thursday. Denise is, uh. Like, not only is is her and her partner's story absolutely incredible, but Denise is just one of the best personalities I've come across in search. We don't, we don't get a ton of women in search too.

So like, she and I just, uh, definitely bonded these things. So she's a lot of fun. Um, great outlook, great mindset, but a lot of like real tactical. Information that you're [00:59:00] gonna get out of that conversation too. So I hope everybody can make it on Thursday, uh, live to give her some energy too. It's always nice when we see some faces kind of nodding at you while you're talking about things.

And then you'll get a chance to ask her all your questions too. So we'll leave plenty of time for that. Um, and yeah, think that's it for today. So thanks everyone. Always good to see you, love these discussions. Excited about how things are rolling. We'll see you on Thursday and then I'll see all of you for, uh, one-to-ones.

And Peter, we're gonna get those scheduled as soon as your first girl comes in too, so you'll get to see my face even more. Um, awesome. See you all soon. Have a great rest of your day. And Lindsay, I'll see you in a couple hours for an hour. Yeah.
