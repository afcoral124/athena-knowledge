# AcquiMatch Buyers Club 02/14/25

[00:00:00] 



**Athena:** Hello. Hello. Hi, Gil. How's it going in the dream? Yeah, we are. I was just on a call with a founder of like, a big brokerage company and he was saying, like, you know, happy energy. We can, we can trick ourselves into being happy. Well, so we got Justin. Hey, Justin, how's it going? Living the dream with this Austin weather.

Are you coming to work tonight? By the way, did you need a message for that? 

**Justin:** I can't, yeah, I can't make that one tonight, but, uh, I wish I could, hopefully in the next one. 

**Athena:** I think it's going to be cold, so stay warm. Amazing. Cool. I think we got a couple other people that are here. It looks like Polly might be here.

Uh, Joe, Destin, cool. Got a good group today. So this is, um, Thank you Going to be a fun 1, so I've been giving you all previews. Um, [00:01:00] and hopefully all of you are able to watch the 1st time that Chris joined us, which is a fantastic kind of look into financial due diligence. What is. The different stages of the deals that you go through and, like, what you should be looking at at those different stages, knowing that you have sometimes limited access to financials before you get to the point where you would order a report, which is something that Chris and his firm does.

But when. We're talking about the financial side and the due diligence side. There's so many layers to this and so many things to know. So I asked Chris if he could come back and actually show you under the hood on a QV report. So, we talked about kind of theory and the different stages and what you want to be looking for last time.

We went in depth about a lot of different conversations, but for you to actually see. What's this report going to look like, and what are all these different aspects, uh, going to be that are included in the report and why that matters. [00:02:00] So he's agreed to take us through a report and explain that. And then once we get through that, we're going to talk about, uh, you know, topics, which we can't talk about enough, which is work in progress, meaning.

For, uh, businesses that are charging for projects that they complete over time, you're going to be taking over the business at a point in time. So how do you determine what the seller keeps from the money that they charge that client for the project and what you keep to deliver whatever's left of that project?

It's called whip or work in progress and also working capital, which is something we can't talk about enough. Chris did some awesome. Uh, explanations of it in the last call and talked about how we can calculate that when we don't necessarily have, um, access to that. But we want to go a little bit more in depth today.

So, um, Chris has done an insane amount of he's he's completely the go to and well respected in this industry. His company also does. Um, [00:03:00] CFO bookkeeping financial support for after transition. So if anyone knows what it's like to look at the financials of business, he does. So thank you so much, Chris, for joining us again and giving us this tour of the report and talking about such fun and exciting topics like WIP and working capital.

We're happy to have you here. 

**Chris:** Yeah, thanks for having me back. I'm really excited to be back and chat with everyone again. 

**Athena:** Awesome. Well, cool. I'm going to hand it over to you because I think you, you're going to just take us through and give us a tour. I might jump in and ask some questions. Folks. Um, if you have questions that come up, you can do a little raised hand or, uh, you know, drop a comment.

Um, and we'll definitely leave time for questions at the end. So it doesn't have to necessarily be about the topics today. You can ask questions, all things, financial due diligence, or if we have some time, Chris has agreed to stay on a little bit later. I think you agreed, didn't you? A little bit later than the hour.

Yeah, 

**Athena:** great. Okay, cool. I'll put you on the spot there, but, um, you know, if we run a little [00:04:00] bit longer and you have deal specific questions too, so just be thinking about your questions as we go through it. It's fun to have a conversation, even though I will. Cool. Find ways to fill the airtime if y'all don't have questions.

So, um, Chris, over to you. 

**Chris:** Awesome. Well, thanks again. Um, again, my last call, I had a bunch of slides. This time we're a little more unstructured. It's going to be going through a report and then, uh, chatting on working capital. Um, so if you have, you know, definitely very casual today, if you've got any questions as I'm showing something, please interrupt me and, uh, I'd love to just answer them as they go.

All right. Well, I'll never see my screen there. Yeah, perfect. Okay. So here is a example report. Um, it's all anonymized. It's a fake company. Um, but I do want to put together a report that, uh, you can see and just see what one, um, from my firm actually would look like. Uh, so here, it's just a table of [00:05:00] contents page where you just have to kind of click the link so you can click around the, uh, the document.

Um, I'm going to start off as I go through, um, basically the same way I would go through it with a real client. We've we've done a project for, um, I like to start with the high points and the main things that we start with are our reconciliations. So I want to make sure, right? These, these statements, actually, this particular deal did have audited financials, but a lot of times we don't have audited financials with these, uh, with these SMB deals.

Um, so you want to make sure even with audited financials, audited financials, that everything that is being reported by the seller. Is tying out to source documents. Um, we see it pretty frequently where if you do the triangulation between the tax return and the bank statements and the books and records, and if they have audited or reviewed financials, you kind of triangling doing all those source information, you're going to find differences.

[00:06:00] And if you do start finding differences, um. It's an indicator that you need to dig deeper, and there could be some error that could definitely affect EBITDA. Um, one of the key ones you've probably heard of before is a proof of cash. So proof of cash is where we're tying the books and records to the bank statements.

Um, and so here is a proof of cash. Up here you'll see Where we're calculating what we call bank revenue and how we're getting to bank revenue Is we're taking all the deposits into their various bank accounts. Sorry, they take money they put in their bank account That's going to get recorded here. And then we want to take out any of those deposits that aren't actually revenue deposits So right they could deposit their money into the bank account because it's a contribution from the owner or it could be Um, a loan from, um, from a bank.

It could be, um, a transfer between two bank accounts like as we have here. And so we want to take any of those deposits that are not [00:07:00] revenue. So, for example, took revenue, took money from one bank account, moved it to another, created a deposit in another bank account. We don't want to. Calculating that as revenue.

So we subtract that out and that gets us to our bank basis revenue. We then want to compare that to what's actually happening in the books and records. Um, so we start off with book revenue and then we want to convert that to a cash basis. And the reason we do that is because if we're comparing to the bank statements, the bank statements by default are on a cash basis.

So we're gonna. Um, transition from an approval basis to a cash basis. In this case, uh, we are counting for is an account receivable. There could be other things in here that could be, um, uh, could be, could be reconciling items. Um, sales tax can sometimes be 1, but if you're just kind of simplifying it, we're taking out accounts receivable and that gets us to a cash basis of revenue.

And you can see this deal was very clean [00:08:00] and we have almost no variance every month. Our goal on a trailing 12 month period, um, when we're working with a client is we want to get to within maybe like 1, 2 percent is what we want to see on a trailing 12 month period is where we feel pretty confident that we're in within material range on the reconciliation of the bank statements.

And sometimes you will see, just by the nature of how these, some of these companies do their bookkeeping is you'll see maybe a positive of 40, 000 1 and then it reverses out the next month. And so it's just some of the timing of how they're doing some of their entries that month end, um, can cause an issue.

But, uh, the important thing is that in the 12 month period, you're within a material in this case. We do the exact same exercise on the expense side. So we take all the disbursements outta the bank account. We wanna account for any of those disbursements that weren't actually expenses for the business.

Um, so in this case, right transfers, right? That's not an [00:09:00] expense. Actually just moving money from one bank account to the other, um, owners draws right? Again, not expense. That's a balance sheet item. So just taking money outta the business. Um, so we account for that there. Again, if we had, like, a pay down on loans, um, or if we had capital expenditures, um, those might be some other reconciling items as well.

We then compare that to what's being recorded in the book

and and, um, um,

so we kind of have an account of all of that. Well, good. Yeah. Do we want. You want to convert that to a cash [00:10:00] basis. So, here we are accounting for changes in credit card liabilities. We also take out the creation expense. Um, any accrual, this wage accrual here and

5%

reconnect their bank account. And they reconnected on the wrong bank, at least that's the story we got. Um, they reconnected it on the wrong date, and they did a bunch of transactions twice that they shouldn't have done twice. And so they ended up overstating the revenue, which dripped directly down to EBITDA by 40, 000.

So that's why something like this can be so important, because All the time they're making messing up their books and you want to compare it to source documents. We've also found before where, uh, there was a business [00:11:00] that did all their transactions through stripe. Um, and if you use, if you used right before, you might know that you're allowed to take out, uh, loans against future receivables.

And they come through and through the bank feed, they look very similar to as if you just made revenue from that business and their bookkeeper just coded everything from Stripe with an auto rule and QuickBooks as revenue. And so they had like 130, 000 of revenue that was booked, but it was actually just a loan they were taking out.

And when we found this. The seller was pretty upset because they had actually paid taxes on about half of that. Um, so these issues come up all the time with bad bookkeeping. So comparing to the source documents, like bank statements, uh, it can be really, really important. Um, any questions on proof of cash?

This is kind of an important one that you might hear that buzzword a lot. So,[00:12:00] 

**Athena:** all right, that makes sense. And I'm going to, I'm going to like. Let's just define terms that I'm sure everybody knows, but when Chris is saying books, he means the, the profit and loss statement, right? Chris. 

**Chris:** Yeah, so they're bookkeeping their QuickBooks, their Xero file, you know, whatever that is. Yeah. 

**Athena:** Great.

Cool. Thank you. This is awesome. 

**Chris:** Right. Um, next reconciliation we'll do is we want to tie the tax return. Um, so I want to make sure that so the way I kind of like, think about the hierarchy, their bookkeeping, their, their QuickBooks file is the least reliable, right? They can put anything they want on there.

Um, tax returns is usually probably the next most reliable because usually if you're, this isn't always true, right? Right? I just gave you that example of someone overpaid their taxes. No idea. Um, because they overstayed their revenue. So it's not guaranteed. Um, but usually people are saying that they made less money on their taxes than they actually maybe did.

So it's a little bit more conservative than their books in a lot of cases. And then their bank [00:13:00] statements is pretty high level of credibility because. You know, you can't go deposit 100 in the chase and have them record as 200. Um, I'd be really rich if you could do that. Um, and so the tax return is just like another rung in the ladder of things we want to, uh, want to look at.

Um, now if you've looked at a business before, you've gotten tax returns, uh, you may find pretty quickly that it's very frequent that the books do not match the taxes at just that face value, right? Net income on the tax return often will not. Match net income, um, in the books and records. Um, Now that does not mean that things are wrong necessarily.

It means that you need to go in and understand how a tax return might be reported differently than, than a, a, a normal just bookkeeping is reported. So, some things that you might see different a lot are If the books are on an accrual basis and the taxes are on a [00:14:00] cash basis, that's going to be a reconciling item, right?

They might have differences in revenue because of that, um, and differences in expenses. Um, you might see differences in, for example here, PPP loans. This is a big one that might be reported differently in the tax return than how it is in the books. That could be a reconciling item. That's one you'll definitely see on a lot of businesses back in 21 and even 22.

Um, depreciation is often both differently between the books and the tax return. Um, there could be things with R& D credits that could be causing differences. There could be things with charitable contributions or the way that meals and, uh, uh, entertainment expenses get deducted. Um, so there could be like a whole, a whole list of items that could be reconciling items.

And this is something that we'll do in the QB processes. We'll go through, we'll match the two up and make sure that they do make sense. And occasionally we'll find large differences. Here's another example. I had a deal that died yesterday, uh, because there was a large variance between the books and the tax return [00:15:00] and, um, the seller essentially claimed that it was because they had been getting divorced and that they were relying on their tax return to try and, like, hide some money from their partner.

And, uh, they were not able to to true up some reconciliations and prove that they were telling the truth. And ultimately, the risk felt too big to the buyer. And they ended up walking away. Um, so, you know, it can definitely bring up flags. If you do have differences between, um, this deal had audit financials as well, which is.

Awesome. Everyone smile. You do get that anytime there's audited financials or there's reviewed financials. We will check them and we will Um reconcile them to the to the tax or to the books and records Um, this one was really easy. No reconcile items. They just matched up perfectly. I have another deal that i'm still working on the They're still working on closing.

Hopefully, they're closing in a few weeks, but, um, I feel a little guilty, but we got the account fired because [00:16:00] the reviewed financials were so far off from the books, um, and the taxes were so often that deal, too. Uh, but that does happen where just because they reviewed financials or just because I financials does not mean they're necessarily done.

Right. Uh, and they, they could be right. If you're auditing financials, that's means you're reporting them with gap. It doesn't mean that. Um, adjustments for, you know, huge large customer that's that's left the business or a one time events are properly recorded for it just means that Yes, this stuff actually, we think this stuff actually did happen.

It's much more of a balance sheet focused analysis than it is looking at, you know, looking at this more of like, this is a business, I'm now going to own this business. What is it going to look like with me as the owner of this company going into the future? Um, let me do a payroll rack. I guess we didn't another 1 that will often.

This 1 might have had all contractors or something, but another 1 that will reconcile is always [00:17:00] their payroll reports. Their payroll tax filings will compare those to the tax returns as well and make sure that, excuse me, the, uh, payroll tax returns will compare those to the books as well and make sure that they tie out.

There's no differences there. Um, any questions on those reconciliations. What is the 

**Athena:** importance of matching the payroll from the books to the taxes? What happens there? 

**Chris:** Yeah, so we want to know that, you know, they said they pay these people this much money. We want to know that that actually is being booked into the books properly.

Um, payroll journal entries, especially not connecting their payroll properly with their books and records. It could be doing their payroll journals, um, improperly for, you know, one reason or another, not capturing everything. So we just want to make sure that's all getting captured. We have had a couple deals where there was some reconciling items and like some back and forth.

Never, I don't think I've ever filled a deal [00:18:00] from payroll issues. Uh, we have flagged payroll issues before with, um, like, is this are the, you know, everyone's being paid as a contractor, but are these really contractors and then brought that up as a potential red flag where these people really all are actually employees and you're probably going to need to transition them post close and on sometimes you'll find that they're gonna be like, well, they're all undocumented and they're not going to be able to be employees, which.

Brings a lot of risk to you as a buyer. So you want to be aware of that. Um, or, uh, maybe everyone's just going to be upset, right? They're going to change it. They're doing their taxes. You don't want to do it that way, or it'll just cost you more. As a business owner. Now, you have to pay those employer payroll taxes by putting them on on payroll.

Um, so there could be a whole litany on of areas that come across. They can come across there as well.

[00:19:00] Um, the next, uh, big report is the actual QA itself. So, here is where we tie out all of our adjustments. Um, everyone lays out their reports a little bit differently. Um, this 1, we. Excuse me, the way that we normally let them out is we'll lay out, uh, reported revenue and any adjustments that were proposed by management.

If we disagree with their adjustments, we'll list them down below as. Management adjustment reversals, and we have all of our own adjustments, whether it be normalization adjustments or recategorization or, um, or proforma adjustments. And here we just had management adjustments and normalization adjustments.

It's going to give you kind of a flavor. Again, it's kind of a simpler deal, but give you a flavor of some of the adjustments that would be in there and how we're verifying them. Um, this deal there had travel expenses. You can tell there was a lot. So this was right off the bat was a big red flag and was a big, [00:20:00] uh.

Big focus of our analysis on this deal. Um, the owner had a ton of travel expenses from where they lived to where the business was, which was about 2000 miles away. Um, and. That's essentially why the travel expenses got so high, is that he moved away from the business, decided he was now going to be an absentee owner, but then figured out that he wasn't actually able to be an absentee owner.

Uh, so he was, all these expenses were Delta flights and hotels and whatever, going back and forth between his home and the business. Um, and our client, and you could see we had backup, and I'll show you where we found the backup. We found backup for all these expenses and were able to find what vendor it was for.

We understood that, okay, these are tickets from this state to the state, uh, these are hotels here. Um, all this makes sense to us and so we agreed with it and we also knew that our buyer client [00:21:00] lived right next to the business and wasn't going to have these same expenses to incur, uh, so we were able to get really comfortable with adding back, um, adding back those expenses.

Um, I'm going to go down to some of the ones that we, we found that the seller, uh, that the seller had not included. Um, so grant income, they had received a grant from the states, from the state, and they had just recorded as revenue. And that to us was a one time event. So we did back that out, and that was between about 30, 000.

Um, they had some iPad purchases. This is something where they had. Uh, their tax accountant had made some journal entries at year end that was like a little bit different than maybe you would do it on GAP financials. So there's a small adjustment to account for how they're doing that properly. We do see that somewhat frequently, like maybe they book, you know, like all of, uh, [00:22:00] I don't know, all of a certain type of expense they'll do at year end.

Like depreciation is always a big one. Sometimes you'll see at year end they split out payroll all at once at the end of the year. Um, or throughout the year it's just all in one line item and then at year end they break it out. All in month of December between payroll taxes and benefits and, and wages.

Um, and so sometimes we'll make an adjustment to smooth that out through the whole year so that the finance will just make more sense. Um, and then we wanna put in a salary to replace the seller. So the seller had a compensation we wanted to add in compensation for our buyer client to get to a, uh, EBITDA calc.

Um, so they had, you know, they're paying us of like 60. We felt like 100 was a more fair salary, uh, for a, um, the CEO of a company of this size. Um, and then accruing for bonuses. So a lot of these companies do they want to won't accrue for bonuses. This is a relatively small one, but sometimes it can be significant.

Um, on a larger business, they might have, you know, 100, [00:23:00] 000 in bonuses that they pay out every, uh, um, every December. If you're analyzing that deal in. October, they may have accrued none of that on their, their P and L. And if they had done that properly, obviously, they should be adding significant expenses to the books.

Um, and so you want to make sure you're accounting for that. Um, as far as 

**Athena:** I'm curious, what are the common rejected ad backs that you see out and or. Maybe we'll start with that 1, then I have another question on ad backs before we move on to other sections. So, what are the common facts that you see people trying to add back in that you end up rejecting?

**Chris:** Yeah, I mean, it's, it's kind of all over the place. Sometimes they'll try and add back some, some things they say are like personal or 1 time that. [00:24:00] They're not verifiable. Um, for example, this morning we were working on a deal where they had, um, they had added back some expenses for employees that they said were like one time bonuses that they'll need to be given again.

It's like, well, we're not going to come into this business and not give bonuses to employees. Like, that's not a legitimate add back. Um, we've, we see sometimes, like, they'll say, hey, we did Marketing thing that was a one time thing. It didn't work. I do it again. Well, a marketing, um, uh, plan is part of being a business owner, right?

You feel about the time. So, like, we're not gonna we're not gonna add that back. Um, I had a deal last week we were meeting with the, the client on and, uh, they had added back, um, there's two people exiting the business for the sale. There's the, the son [00:25:00] and the owner himself and the son was basically doing all the sales and they're both exiting the business.

They added back both of their salaries. And so obviously, like, the owner's working 10 hours a day, and then the son, even if he wasn't working a ton, he's still a key part of the business. Like, we can't add back that whole salary. We have to replace that salary. So that, that's when that comes up as well.

Sometime along that same line of employees, something we find Fairly, uh, not regular, but every once in a while, uh, if we are doing, like, we'll do this analysis of staff turnover and, uh, every once in a while you'll find like a gap in a certain position. Um, we had a deal where there was a, it was a manufacturing company.

They had a quality assurance manager. They having a really hard time filling that role, and the position was empty for like six months. So we baked that salary into those six months. Now you show you that 30,000, you know, dollars or that $50,000. That would have been spent had you been fully staffed. [00:26:00] Um, I kind of got on a tangent there, but 

**Athena:** no, I, I think that's like, that was 1 of the things on 1 of the deals we worked on that you caught that I thought was so clever.

Right? It's like, oh, the employee costs were less than, like, no, actually, you were, you were understaffed. You needed. To have, like, that was a seat. So, um, you know, these are the things that. Person is team, or they do this day in and day out and we would think to to dig into a little bit deeper on those sorts of things.

Um, on the on the flip side of the, what do you normally reject? What. Add backs, surprise people that you confirm that are valid. 

**Chris:** Um, I guess surprise people. Um, I mean, some of these, some of these things like, like this travel one, I think, because it's like some of these personal like expenses, um, as long as we can tie them all the way back to the general ledger, uh, we can usually get comfortable with them as long and in [00:27:00] most cases, as long as it makes sense, right?

If they have all these expenses and they're going to Hargis every day and. Uh, you know, like, we can usually get comfortable with the fact that, alright, that's That's them just spending money on themselves as long as we can tie it to the P& L. That's the key thing is that every once in a while we'll get an owner where they'll say, and I kind of believe them, right?

Like conceptually they say like, Hey, I, I spend, you know, if I go on vacation, I run it through the business. Or, um, if I, uh, you know, go out to ELL, I'll run it through the business. So like, I think you should add back 10 grand and it's just like a flat number and they're like, here's the piece of paper with 10 grand right now.

But if I can't like trace that transaction all the way back to how it actually feeds in the financial statements, There's there's it's not gonna get by a bank and I can't feel comfortable It's legitimate like I have to be able to tie it to here's where it hit in the bank account Here's all the way where it went financial statements here.

I was coded [00:28:00] properly something actually i've seen some This is another one from just this morning. That's top of mind, but we had a deal with the seller added back um a bunch of Tax payments, and they also added back a bunch of loan payments. Well, those didn't hit the P& L. We traced them, and they were booked properly where they hit the balance sheet.

So there were distributions for taxes, and they were like a, uh, The principal payments on the loan. So those don't actually end up ever end up hitting the P& L. So adding that back, you're duplicating that. So anything like that, we want to just make sure we're tracing it to the actual general ledger, seeing where does it actually flow, like what is the entry that's actually made, and then we could feel comfortable with, all right, conceptually, do we agree with this?

Is there support? Okay, well, we'll either add Really, the reject or accept it from there. So 

**Athena:** it's fascinating. 

**Chris:** All these adjustments here that we're just talking about, like, we, we make [00:29:00] sure that we have full support for them. So, like, all the automobile expenses, we pulled them all out. We here's exactly where they hit the transaction, the date, how it flowed in the bank account and the generator.

So we make sure that everything that we're including. Um, I think I took out some of the details just for the example report, but we want to make sure that everything in there has, uh, has support for it and that we can, you know, we'll feel comfortable with, uh, with including it. And there are some cases too, it'll depend on your bank.

Um, there's some banks that I know that, like, a personal expenses, like, if you, if that seller pays personal expenses, I don't care, like, they don't care if it was their phone. Or meals or whatever, like if they ran it through the business, there's some banks that are conservative and they will not accept it.

And so you need to make sure that your DSCR works. With those things not accepted. Um, but there's other banks that that will accept some of those.

**Athena:** That's a really good point. And when I don't want to gloss over. So can you [00:30:00] pull that 1 out? Explain what you mean with some banks. You're talking about SBA vendors when you go to actually get lending and you're presenting them with the backs and how you're determining, you know, your purchase price and what the S.

C. E. is. And like, you've got these ad backs, which is helping you get there. So explain what you said a little bit more so people can wrap their heads around, like, even if, if we believe this to be an ad back, you're going to be faced with sometimes that the banks won't agree with that. Right? So can you give us a little more color on that?

Because I think it's super important and valid. 

**Chris:** Yeah. Yeah. So every bank has a different appetite, right? There's different deals. They like, there's different things they'll accept. Some of them will accept if there's enough verification, like if you do get a Q of E, they'll accept it. And there's some third party that's looked at it.

Um, some of them are just kind of a blanket thing, like, you know, we're writing the easy deals. We're writing the ones that are right down the fairway, that make sense. Um, those are the only ones that we're going to write. [00:31:00] Um, so you, That's one of the benefits of working with a, like an SBA loan broker in some cases where you can bring your deal to someone that knows a lot of banks and knows the appetite of a lot of banks, uh, and they can say, okay, well, this type of deal, you're going to need to go to this person, or, you know, we could probably go to, you know, this person's credit box works really well over this type of deal.

Cause like sometimes there's weird things too. Like I know SBA lenders that do a lot of deals that they hate real estate. Right. Like they don't want any real estate on the deal while there's other banks. That love real estate, right? They want real estate. They feel like, Oh, there's a hard asset. Uh, that makes me feel a lot more comfortable.

Um, there's some banks that they won't touch. Um, landscaping, you know, they got burned once on or burned a couple of times on landscaping deals. Other banks that are totally fine lending on it. So, um, I want to get an idea of for the type of business that you're trying to buy who are the lenders that have the [00:32:00] appetite for that type of deal.

**Athena:** This is awesome. Please carry on 

**Chris:** awesome. Okay. Um, so that's QB tab and I've talked about how we tie all of our adjustments. Um, we didn't recast the financials. We want to be able to show you like month by month. Um, here's what the business would look like with those adjustments in line. Um, so we do show all that, uh, go back.

**Athena:** Can you just also explain again? I know we touched on this last time, but like, now that they're seeing it, like, what are recast financials and how do you come up with those? 

**Chris:** Yeah, so that's a great question. Actually, let me go back here. So if we're looking at. This tab here, this is like what you might look at what if you got access to the QuickBooks or something from the sales side.

Um, this is all their, all their [00:33:00] account numbers, all their, uh, all their transactions monthly. Let me have all that information from the seller, um, then you're going to have some adjustments and oftentimes the way it's represented is listed down below. Right? You have all these adjustments listed down below.

And sometimes it's obvious where those adjustments go, right? Like, it might be a 1 for 1 where I added back 300 bucks here. There's also going to be a line of up here for 300 bucks. And so it's really easy to see. Um, Okay. Sometimes it's not. And so we go through and actually tie it to the specific line item.

We know exactly where it is. And then when we recast the financials, we will show all those adjustments in line. So you'll see, here's what the P& L would look like, had all those adjustments. Already been adjusted, like, actually in the financials themselves versus having to see here is what was originally the financials.

And then here's the adjustments down below. You're seeing it all all at face value up here. So if I go back to the [00:34:00] QB tab right here, you can see. So we're at. 244 in this deal, 244, um, in the last 12 months EBITDA, and then you see like, like this recast view of the P& L. We're also at 244. So all these expenses are already adjusted and already have the adjustments right, uh, right in those expense line items, um, uh, for those adjustments.

Does 

**Athena:** that make sense? Yeah, not only are you. Adjusting them, but like, aren't you rebuilding them after you verified like a bank statements too? So it's like a full comprehensive. Almost audit or verification of the books, rather than just being like, okay, we're going to take their books and add these things into it.

Like, you're rebuilding. The books essentially, right? 

**Chris:** Yeah, it's it's not an audit. It's a little different than audit, but, uh, yeah, we are, we're going to in depth analysis doing [00:35:00] a lot of those. Testing procedures that you might do in an audit do often get looked at, but it is on the CPA. So I have to make sure you guys know it's not an audit.

Yeah, sorry. I'm using 

**Athena:** the wrong word. So, uh, your CPAs are, um. You know, you're licensed and you're a fiduciary, right? Like, all those things. So it's important. Chris uses the right words, even if I might use the wrong ones. It's not audited.

**Chris:** Yeah, um, I'm going to jump to actually, you know, let's talk about working capital. So working capital again, this one a little simpler, but I think it makes it easy to look at. So when we talk about working capital, um, working capital at its face is all current assets minus current liabilities. Right, so when we're doing a deal, we will start with all the current assets and we'll list out all the current liabilities.

And then we have just your reported [00:36:00] working capital. Um, we'll then make adjustments to that to remove any, um, any definitional adjustments to work capital. Definitional adjustments would be removing things like debt, um, removing things like, like the bank accounts and cash. Um, we would be removing. Okay.

Um, any debt, like items, um, would also get removed. Um, this one didn't really have too much outside of the definitional items to remove, but then we also might make adjustments to the financials that we're finding just because there's, there might be an error. Uh, for example, we've, we've had deals where, um, they added a bunch of invoices to their books, but they never actually match the payment properly with those invoices.

So the balance of accounts receivable is astronomical. Um, and so then we had to go back in and back out all the. Not real accounts [00:37:00] receivable. And so there was an adjustment both to Revenue on the QV tab for the EBITDA calculation. And then there was also an adjustment to working capital to accurately represent the current assets.

Um, then we get down to recast. Uh, networking capital again, this was a simpler deal. Often you're gonna be left with accounts receivable if there's accounts payable and then, uh, uh, inventory kind of like the 3 main ones, but there also could be things like, um, you know, payroll liabilities, cost, nexus of billing, billing, nexus of costs.

Those can also be, uh, showing up on here. In this case, we just have a are pretty simple and, um, but you can see, Okay. We will track out monthly with the working capital figure looks like what's actually making up that working capital figure. Um, again, simpler deal, um, and we can use this once we have a recast view of the main components of working capital, we're going to calculate the [00:38:00] cash conversion cycle.

And so all this is really important as you're trying to figure out what you should be asking for from the seller, um, from a, uh, working capital perspective. Um, in this case, we calculated that the day sales outstanding was 30 days, which means that you work today. On average, uh, you're gonna take you 30 or 31 days to receive money from your customers.

Um, on those invoices,

I probably lost over that. Maybe too much. Is there more questions? Um, 

**Athena:** Yeah, so I think, um, in terms of what makes that so, um, some folks get a little bit confused in terms of, like, oh, why are we not counting the cash in the account or the debts that they have and that sort of thing. So, like, if you were to explain what you're including in this calculation and why right?

And I, I know we've defined this for folks. We talked about it last time, but, like I said, it's, [00:39:00] it, it's always worth just revisiting it from a different angle every time. So. 

**Chris:** Yeah, yeah. So working capital, we're trying to figure out, like, what is the operating cash flow look like in this particular business?

And so how much cash someone has on their balance sheet, um, doesn't really have a bearing on on how the business is, right? Because I can keep a million dollars in my balance sheet, or I can keep it. Right. So 200, 000 in my balance sheet doesn't necessarily change how much cash I needed to run this business.

Um, it might just be the appetite of the owner. So if someone keeps more cash on their balance sheet, like you don't necessarily punish them for that. Um, 

**Athena:** Nor are you entitled to their cash. 

**Chris:** What's that? 

**Athena:** Nor are you entitled to their cash if they've stocked a lot away. 

**Chris:** Exactly. However, if they are. I've seen this before.

This is something you might, you might run into if they're really slow to get paid or they [00:40:00] pay people really quickly. Uh, that's that's their problem. Um, like, you're not going to come in and now, like, that's the way the business has been run. Um. That's your upside to go in and now fix that thing. But if they, if they pay people and or get paid by people in 60 days, they say, uh, you could get paid in 45 if you were better at invoicing.

Well, the business currently isn't good at invoicing. So now I'm going to come in and fix that. I'm not going to take less work and capital in the deal because of some advantage. It's like, right. You buy a rental property. You don't pay as if rents had already been raised, right? You don't pay the value of that property as if rents were already been raised.

So that's. That's the whole reason you're buying the property is you get to raise rents and you get the upside of doing that and take that risk. Um, I've seen it also like a lot of these small businesses don't have a good policy or good, um, processes for accounts payable. That's probably the side you'll see it more frequently on where they pay everything right when it comes in, right?

It's [00:41:00] the owner, they do it themselves. They don't have a outsourced firm that can handle accounts receivable or excuse me, accounts payable. Um, so everything gets paid. As soon as it comes in the door, which hurts their work capital, right? Because they, they pay everyone right away and they get paid in 30 days.

So. That means less cash or more cash is being tied up and there's less cash actually sitting in the bank account. Right. So 

**Athena:** just rephrase that to make sure we got that concept. Okay. When, when some people could get paid earlier, but they're not necessarily following up or chasing those payments. So when we're looking at these reports, it's based on what they've done.

Not the efficiencies that you're going to make, right? So somebody could get paid in 30 days, but they're taking 60 days to get paid. You're going to base the working capital number with the seller based on how they performed. Right? So, like, like you said, that's their problem equally. They have payment terms.[00:42:00] 

With vendors or suppliers, that's like, 30 days, but they're paying immediately. That's also affecting their cash flow by doing that, because they're taking 2 months to get paid, but they're paying people immediately. So, you're going to base your capital based on the working practices that they've done, but also something for you to bear in mind is, is this an area of improvement?

Like, are they just slacking on. You know, making sure they're being paid in a timely manner and or are they paying people to quickly when when the payment terms are extended? So it might be an area of opportunity, but not necessarily 1 that you need to give the owner less of a work capital requirement because they've just not.

Been on top of this. Did I restate that correctly, Chris? 

**Chris:** Yeah. Yeah, you nailed it. Yep Yeah, exactly. I say like maybe the one caveat like everything has its exceptions, right? Like If maybe there's been a you might make a pro forma [00:43:00] adjustment if like six months ago They renegotiated with customers and now they have new contracts in place that show All right for the last six months.

We actually have been getting paid in five days So looking at the trailing 12 months is not fair. We're going to make an adjustment to show the business a little bit differently um, that might be one where you're gonna show that but you don't want to just Change everything on day one of the business.

Like we've used the example of vendors getting paid, right? If vendors are used to getting paid in three days by this guy, you're not going to come in and now just pay everyone in 45 days and make everyone. You're going to, you're shaking up enough things. You don't want to get vendors mad at you too.

**Athena:** Yeah, exactly. Like first 90 days, at least you change absolutely nothing, you know, because you don't know why things are the way that they are and or who's going to piss off if you change things. And you haven't been there long enough to figure it out. So, absolutely vendors are used to getting paid day 1 and there's a new owner that comes in and it's like, dragging their feet, not paying them time, like, you know, [00:44:00] establish the relationship before and like that.

So, the other thing I, I heard this at an event in Miami, I was curious if this is also your experience, but a guy was talking about doing and he's like, we know we've gotten the working capital amount. Correct. When both parties are a little bit disappointed, 

**Chris:** that's probably fair. I mean, I'd say most of my work.

Like, where I get involved on just, you know, we're doing the report and we're analyzing the financials and we give our figures on eBay, everything like that. Usually I won't get many follow up questions on our adjustments. Like, I don't get that many, but I almost always. Have to talk to all parties about working capital like that's always ends up being a negotiation and a bit of a dog fight um And yeah, I would say at the end of the day with any good negotiation a lot of people walk away a little Little upset.

So yeah [00:45:00] 

**Athena:** You don't, you don't want to completely screw over the seller too, right? Like, if you're asking for considerably more than you, you actually need is fair, then you're kind of taking away from, 

you 

**Athena:** know, their earnings in a sense, but you also don't want to leave yourself in a place where you show up day 1, you're paying those vendors day 1, right?

As soon as you get those invoices for 30 days, sometimes 60 days before you get paid, right? And, like, if you haven't accounted for that, that in your deal, then guess what? You just paid for a business. We're also going to have to come up with 2 months of expenses on top of what you paid for the business to be able to run it for the 1st, couple of months while you wait for your payment to come through.

**Chris:** Yeah, exactly. And, and two, in that negotiation, you kind of want to think about like, is this enough to kill the deal? Like, we had a deal recently. They're still working on closing, but we did the QV a while back. And, uh, we calculated like [00:46:00] 625 or something like that as our working capital calculation. They started off at 17, 000.

So it was like, all right, well, this is a problem. Um, it definitely isn't 17, 000. Like we might go off a little bit. We're definitely not in the same ballpark. Eventually, they got up to there at like 570. And it was like, all right, well now we're like close and they ended up, they split the difference, they're about 600.

So yeah, you don't need to get every dollar necessarily, but you definitely want to make sure that you're comfortable with the dollar you're getting and that you have, you're going to be able to fund operations post close. 

**Athena:** Yeah, wow. 17, 000 to 700, 000 is a big jump and that would bankrupt you for sure.

You take that business over and agree to 17, 000, you know, and on a deal that we worked on that we saw, like, the original working capital estimate. You know, it was 1 thing and then as, because the negotiations took a really long time and things [00:47:00] changed and the business was doing exceptionally well. So, because of that, the working capital requirements doubled.

During the course of negotiations, so even more important to do this, like, you know, you're, you're kind of. Later in the deal, but also shoring that up, you know, do you look at this again? If things take a really long time, like. 

**Chris:** Yeah, yeah. And that's, uh, that's actually a really great point to bring up. Um, so I have here a list of the end, like, 12 months, 6 months, 3 months, depending on the business, you might use one of those 3 or you might even use a different method.

Um, if a business is growing, right? Like the one you just mentioned, uh, the business is growing. Typically working capital is also growing, right? If it takes you 60 days to get paid and, uh, you have 3 million revenue, you got like half a million bucks in working capital, I think someone could check me, but I think that's close, close enough, pretend it's right.[00:48:00] 

Um, and if you double the business and now you're doing 6 million in revenue, you now need a million dollars of working capital, right? So that the business has grown. So if you have a business that's growing quickly. Oftentimes using a shorter time frame for that average is more applicable. So using a six month or a three month average is going to be more of the right figure to use.

Um, if it's a business that is, uh, pretty steady state, often a 12 month average is, is going to work just fine. Or a six months, 12 or six months is going to work just fine. If it's a really seasonal business, you might weight the months more heavily. where this is actually active. So if you're talking about like, you know, the classic example of like a costume manufacturer and seller, right?

Their working capital is really strange because they're having to build all of it, all their inventory throughout the year. Then they turn that inventory into accounts receivable all in October and November. And then. [00:49:00] All of a sudden, they collect all the cash and the working capital goes through the floor.

Um, so you might, if you were looking at that business, you would probably weight really heavily in your calculation. Those months where the business is very active, you know, around that like October time frame, and you wouldn't, you would discount the months where the business isn't really active, um, in your calculation.

So. Depending on the business, you might look at that that calculation. 

**Athena:** Yeah, great point. Right? Seasonality also is super important. So, any of the businesses that y'all are looking at where there is seasonality. Even more of a reason to get a report like this, so that Chris and his team can point that out to you where there is an analogy or where you need to consider when you're taking over the business and working capital requirements on seasonality.

Um, but equally, I, I. Imagine having a report like this to go back to the seller versus. Me just saying, I need more working capital probably has a lot more of a positive impact [00:50:00] on actually being able to get there. Like, in the case where it was, they agreed 17, 000 and they got to 600, you know, like, just having you in the report make a big difference there.

**Chris:** Oh, yeah, I mean, I, I love a deal like that because, I mean, the ROI and my fees is like, pretty freaking good when you make 700 grand in the deal. Um, that's relatively common. Like if you are in negotiation and then you are able to show like here's here's how we calculated it and here's all the support for how we calculated and the detailed analysis of it.

Um, I'd say where I've seen that happen most most frequently, we're able to get the other side to agree is if initially the seller. Does their own calculation, or maybe the seller and the broker do their own calculation of working capital. Um, and then we do ours, and then they go back, and like, they're off, and then maybe they bring their accountant into it, that, you know, understands it a little better, and how it's calculated, and then kind of come to Jesus moment, and, [00:51:00] um, then we get a lot closer.

Uh, that's how I, I see that going pretty frequently, is, uh, like the seller might keep. This is actually one we were working on recently. Um, the seller, the seller might keep a hundred grand in bank account, right? And they think that's all you need to run this business. You need a hundred thousand dollars to run this business.

But they discount the fact that they have built up this account receivable balance of who knows how much money, which means they have money continually coming in every day to replenish that hundred thousand dollars. So yeah, they only need 100 grand in because that kind of like keeps them from the ebbs and flows, but they're also getting deposited in the bank account every single day.

If it takes you, if you have 30 day terms with people, or you have 60 day terms or whatever it is, um, if, if you buy that business on day one with no accounts receivable, That means you have to fund that business until money comes in the door, which is going to be that either 30 days, 60 days, which is a pretty [00:52:00] long time.

And you don't want to be like Indiana Jones, like coming under the, uh, you know, the, the, the trap door as it's falling down and like barely get in, like. If the business needs 300 grand, um, you don't want to like 300 grand to fund the business for a month. You don't want to only have 300, 000 there. Uh, you want to have some buffer with your line of credit and getting the right working capital from the seller.

Um, and so that you feel comfortable that you're, you're going to be able to get through to where money actually has come in the door. 

**Athena:** Yeah, I love the analogy. That's great. That's a good analogy that we should all use. I like using real. Analogies, we can Robert, especially when a lot of folks are working with off market.

Opportunities where there's not a broker there to kind of explain it to the seller. So the ways that we can just, like, humanize and use these little concepts, like, I don't want to be like Indiana Jones. You know, I love that. Cool. I keep interrupting. I think this is great. [00:53:00] So, uh, I'll let you carry on. If there was more you wanted to show here.

**Chris:** Well, those are the high points I was hit on and then I usually just. Kind of run through all the tabs, so just kind of, I'll just, uh, I'll just do that quick. Again, if you have any questions, just feel free to interrupt. This is kind of a whole report, what it ends up looking like. They're usually around, oh, what's this one?

Like 38 pages, like 30 to 40 pages at a time. Um, but a lot of it's stuff. Those ones we went through are the most important. So we have a glossary and always put in like key findings. So anything that we. Kind of like what I just talked about. Um, I'll always make notes of that in a key findings tab so you can reference and you have some, some color to everything that you're looking at.

So it's all just not, not just all numbers. Uh, we have the actual PNL recast. Um, we always like summarizing the accounts as well. So something we'll do. So it's a little bit easier to digest, a little bit easier to look at, um, versus seeing like a long, some of these businesses, it's ridiculous, their chart of accounts, they might have like a hundred accounts and it's really hard to [00:54:00] visualize and look at.

So we like to make it a little bit easier to digest, um, all of our reconciliations, um, bridging EBITDA, that's always one I think is really nice to look at too. So, right, when we look at the cutie tab, go back for a 2nd, uh, even a change your beer, maybe that's 76, 000 dollars. I went up to 1 90 and came down.

It went up to 3 18 and came down to 2 44. Why did that happen? Um, so, like, the bridge of the years, so that 1 90 in 2022, it went up to 18 and 2023. Um, what were the drivers of the differences? So the green bar here is showing an increased EBITDA. So gross profit was a big driver of the increase. Um, and then, you know, gray bar, there are reduction EBITDA.

So here, if you have, uh, like insurance, so insurance costs increased by 15. 1, 000, which, you know, increased expenses, you know, negatively impact EBITDA. So I [00:55:00] always like to bridge and show, um, you know, Alright, EBITDA, it's easier to remember why. Uh, current year trading. This is what we like to show as well.

So through this point in the year. Uh, what does this year look like versus prior years through the same year? So, versus just looking at like a 12 month period all the time, um, through the 1st, 6 months of the year through the 1st. 9 months of the year, whatever, uh, what did, what did the business look like?

So, in this case, we're looking at through September of 2024 versus through September 2023, just trying to a lot of times we're doing trying to gain insights into, um, all right. Well, revenues up year to date. Versus last year, uh, cost of goods sold or we look at the same thing on this next tab. We're looking at year to date to the first nine months.

What does the last three months typically look like? So maybe it's a business where all their EBITDA comes the last three months of the year. I'm like, okay, well, that's interesting. It can maybe, um, cause you to want to dive deeper and, uh, and [00:56:00] look a little more into the company. Seasonality. So I always track seasonality.

What does revenue look like throughout the year in this business? This one was pretty flat. Um, but sometimes you will see on that chart, um, pretty big swings throughout the year. I'm just tracking growth and revenue over time, um, zooming in on gross profit. So I had mentioned that gross profit and that EBITDA bridge was a big driver of the change year over year.

All right. Well, why did gross profit change? Um, in some cases it's because they sell more, right? Gross profit could increase if your gross profit percentage is always the same, but you sell more, right? Your gross profit. Total dollar amount goes up, or you can sell the same amount, but your cost can be lower.

And that will also increase, uh, increase gross profit. So we want to map out here how much of it was because they sold more. How much of gross profit increase is because, uh, their margin was higher or higher. I think with this, [00:57:00] Um, you know, they were just growing the business. They were selling more. That's why the volume effects was higher.

They're more customers. Um, but then Martin's got squeezed, uh, as they had to, um, um, make new hires. So, uh, zoom in on operating expenses, staff turnover. This one's always fun to look at. Uh, what does turnover look like in this business? This was a business in particular where um, Uh where there's a ton of turnover so you can see like in 2023 Uh in the same year, they hired 17 people and lost 17 people all in the same year Um, so again now it's a flag Hey, if i'm gonna run this business, i'm basically gonna be running an hr department I need to be bringing people in all the time.

It also could indicate something about This one I think is kind of industry, um, but it could be something about the industry. And it also could just say something about the business itself where maybe the owners are jerk. Maybe, uh, it's not run well. Um, it's it can sometimes [00:58:00] cause you to dig deeper into.

All right. But why, why, uh, why do I need to keep hiring people in order to stay staffed? I think this was really low age work and it's pretty, pretty tough work. And it was a home care business, pretty typical in that industry. I'll blow you to figures. Talk about the Q and E. Here's the recast financials we discussed all of our support for our adjustments working capital.

We talked about in the cash conversion cycle. We talked about proof of cash and then some more source documents. So, yeah, that's, um, that's a pretty good idea of what a few of you would look like. 

**Athena:** This is so cool and I imagine for a lot of you, this is the 1st time you're seeing something like this and I hope it gives you.

A bit of confidence on how thorough this process is going to be before you actually, you know, purchase a business that you have a team like Chris's to go through everything and point out, like, what's [00:59:00] normal with, you know, and also what what's something to be concerned about. So, I think, you know, what might be something that somebody sees as a red flag, you see it all the time and you're actually, this is this is normal.

Right? And 1 of the things I wanted to ask you about is, like. How often do you see, you know, somebody's looking at the for a business up until October. And then they get the year end and it's like, oh, my God, December, what happened? You know, like, how normal is that? The, the, the end of year, like, last month of the year, whatever their financial period is, is, is, you know, there, there might be, like, big swings in there, but actually that's normal because people are shoring up their books and end of year stuff before.

**Chris:** Yeah, we see that fairly regularly where they get a lot of entries in all at the end of the year and you'll see a lot of funky stuff happen, both good and bad. Sometimes December looks horrible, like I talked about with bonuses, right? Like maybe they don't pay bonuses until December and then all of a sudden they throw a [01:00:00] hundred grand in expenses and you're like, wait, what?

Like I was expecting even it'd be this number for the year. Um, but you didn't tell me this was going to happen. Um, We'll also see a lot with like, I think I talked a lot about last time was revenue recognition is often an issue with these businesses. Um, they might be. Either pushing out, getting paid from people because they want to push their tax bill in the next year.

We've seen that December always is this, uh, really low month. Um, and then January is like a really high month because every year they're, like, delaying receipts. Uh, so that, that can happen. Or occasionally it's the opposite where Uh, maybe it's a seasonal business. They fill their jobs up in like October, beginning November, and then the checks start coming in over the next couple of weeks, uh, through the end of the year.

And then, you know, if they're doing a cash accounting, they're not properly doing their revenue recognition. All of a sudden, like all this revenue gets dumped in the [01:01:00] books at the end of the year. So that happens too. Uh, so yeah, you will see that and going through and understanding why that's happening and how maybe it should have been done properly can be really important and usually leads to some adjustments.

**Athena:** Yeah, and that's the key word. There is adjustments, not necessarily a deal breaker. You know, what a lot of people don't understand is that running the books as a small business owner is a full time job, you know, but if they don't have a full time person on it, and even when they do, as you gave the example of the bookkeeper that booked 100 grand as revenue, which was actually alone, um, you know, there's not not.

There's a lot of things that it wasn't that they were trying to do fraud or it's just like they're running their business rather than trying to keep audited financials going on. It may be an adjustment, but it's not necessarily a deal breaker. And I think for folks that are used to rigid financials, audited financials, maybe they come from P.

E. or corporate backgrounds. That can be 1 of the hardest things for them to get comfortable [01:02:00] with. So, you know, having a report like this and somebody like yourself that. You know, sees this all day long, and you can tell them like, hey, this is an adjustment. It's not necessarily the owner doing something that was fraudulent or bad or, you know, a deal breaker.

Like, do you have a lot of those kinds of conversations? 

**Chris:** Um, I'd say, like, we're usually coming in below reported just frankly, um, are some cases where we find something where. We can get comfortable with it, uh, like those travel things, those travel expenses, for example, like that's one that at face value, as soon as I looked at the deal, I'm like, what do you mean?

Like, he's adding back a hundred, like almost a hundred thousand dollars in 2023 for travel. And once we went in, we verified it, we were able to get comfortable with it. Um, but I'd say on the whole, we usually end up coming in below. It's just how far below are we going to be? Um, I usually tell [01:03:00] people, like, when you write your LOI, uh, you should be comfortable that EBITDA is going to be, you know, 10 percent lighter than, than what you're assuming it is when you write your LOI, because you don't want to be in a situation where the deal is so tight.

That my report comes back 5 percent light and now you're going to retrade, which is going to make everybody really mad at you, right? Because retreating is really, you know, they're like, okay, you're like, 10 grand. Like, well, let's get this deal done. Um, so feel comfortable that. Your, you know, your deal still works and you're not like so stressed to what you're offering that, uh, even if you are a little bit light on the unit of figure, um, at, uh, you won't need to retrain.

Maybe you still use that as leverage to negotiate something else for the deal, uh, more working capital or a longer transition period that's unpaid or more reps and warranties, whatever, you know, bigger seller. No, I'm something that's not that number that they get to talk about the golf course, right?

That's the most. emotional thing to them is the, [01:04:00] the number that the, you know, the big number of the purchase price. Um, but then obviously if it does get outside of that, that range of, you know, you're outside of that 10 percent and start getting 20, 30, even more percentage, obviously then you start to start thinking about is this worth retrading or going a long way.

**Athena:** I'm curious how y'all treat Uh, advanced tax strategies or how SBA looks at 'em, like for example, Augusta, do you come across businesses where owners are using the Augusta rule and how does SBA feel about that as an aback? 

**Chris:** Yeah, I mean, the Augusta rule, like at the end of the day, it usually doesn't mount to very big dollar amount.

Um, like for example, see you guys, those that don't know are you can rent your, rent your home 14 days a year. Um, without having to pay taxes on that rental income. Um, so if you rent it to your business, honestly, I don't see it too frequently where people are actually doing this, but if, if they do rent their [01:05:00] home to their business for 14 days a year, they can then, uh, deduct that rental payment on the business taxes, but then don't have to report that income to themselves personally.

Um, like, unless you're living in, like, the right area, or like, you have a really expensive house, like, how much can you really rent your house out for a day? Like reasonably, um, maybe a thousand bucks, like if it's like the right place, maybe a few hundred. So, you know, 14 days a year, let's say it is a thousand.

That's probably pretty high for most homes in most areas. I know my home in Little Wisconsin is, I ain't getting a thousand bucks a day for it. Yeah. You know, that's going to be 14 grand a year, which, you know, something like that wouldn't be, uh, Super relevant, but we definitely see things from a tax perspective.

I'd say the biggest stuff that comes up are Like things like R& D credits something we usually have to look into ERC credits has been a big one obviously over the past few years with [01:06:00] COVID Sales tax is always a big one too. Like are they properly collecting on and remitting sales tax? That could always be a pretty big deal killer if they're not doing that properly Because that, even in an asset sale, that liability will follow you as a buyer.

**Athena:** That was a perfect segue because I was going to, you were touching on taxes earlier when we were going through the report. If they haven't been paying taxes property, sales tax, or even business tax, even in an asset sale. They can still be liable, correct? 

**Chris:** And then an asset sale, like the sales tax, yes.

Income taxes, that's going to stick with the owner, and an asset sale will stick with the, um, the owner, or the seller, that's their problem. In a stock sale, though, you know, you could have more issues. 

**Athena:** Even at a C Corp level, if they weren't [01:07:00] 

**Chris:** If it's an asset sale, like, you're right. It's a totally new entity, right?

You don't own that 

**Athena:** liability. Yeah. Great. Okay, cool. Um, so, uh, something we didn't touch on yet, but I would love to talk about is with what is it like, you know, maybe this business didn't have that in their report, but like, um, you know, how do you address that? And why is it important for people to pay attention to?

First of all, 

**Athena:** what, what is it in your own words? I've explained it, but I think it's always good to hear another definition. Yeah. So 

**Chris:** with work in process, right? Um, I actually can kind of bundle this all under what we call debt like items. So, when you buy businesses, you probably know you're buying it cash, free, debt free.

In most cases, um, however, there could be some debts that aren't traditional debts that you could be buying. Um, for example, WIP. So the seller has been paid [01:08:00] for some work and that work is still in process. And so now you have to come in and finish that work. So you're basically buying the liability of having to complete that work.

And if the seller has already been paid for that work that was completed, then you need to be compensated for that liability that you're Right. Um, and so that's, work process would fall under that category. Another one, a business similar to the one we just looked at, I just did another deal on it. It had a bunch of, um, it was a home care business.

They had a bunch of, like, security deposits for all their, their customers, like, have to pay these deposits in. And then when, if they leave, everything's good, they get paid back. Well, that's a, a liability. That money have, eventually has to get paid back. So you, as a buyer, you come in, you need to figure out what is that, Reconcile figure for that debt like item that you're then going to collect that cash that when the time does come to give that back.

**Athena:** Right. If you're a property [01:09:00] management company and you like charge tenants for a pet deposit, you know, and so all of those pet deposits were charged before you're there, but if the tenant leaves, you're required to pay it back if their pet didn't destroy the place. To use a very simple term, right? Um, so this comes up with project based work and manufacturing too.

So I know that can get a little bit dicey when trying to determine if you're midway through a project. So how do you approach that? 

**Chris:** Yeah, so a business, the way they should do their accounting, right? And this ties into revenue recognition as well. The way they should do their accounting and they should track every month.

Here's all our projects. Here's our budget for that project. Here's how much we've actually spent on that project. And that allows us to gauge what percentage through that project we are, right? We budgeted to spend 100 grand. We've spent 60 so far. We're 60 percent done. Um, and then you got to compare that to how much they've been paid.

So maybe that same project, they, the budget, what they were going to get [01:10:00] paid for that budget is 200 grand. So they're 60 percent done with that project. They should have recognized 120, 000 in revenue. But maybe they haven't been paid 120, 000 yet. Maybe they've been paid 150, 000. So now there's 30, 000 that's sitting in, um, unearned revenue.

You know, you might consider that like whip or, you know, that's showing up in the balance sheet in different ways with these companies. Um, but you as the buyer. Um, it's if that revenue is not earned yet, but it's been given to the seller, right? That that work in process revenue has been enough work hasn't been done yet.

The seller has already received that cash. You don't want them running off of that cash. So you want to look at all those open projects at closing. We'll usually calculate them in the, in the QB process. We'll do it at that time. But you also want to true up at the day of closing. Right? Here's everything that's in process.

Here's how much has been spent. Here's how much, uh, the budget is for it. Um, and here's what money is going to go to the seller and here's what [01:11:00] money is going to go to me as the buyer.

**Athena:** Um, so for anybody that had, like, if you're getting paid for something that takes a while to deliver, that's something really important to look at. Not necessarily something you negotiate pre LOI. It's like, you want, you want Chris and his team to kind of go through it in detail and give you some evidence, you know, and like, like some, some thought processes around it.

Um, you know, you 

**Chris:** do just want to make sure that the, like. That the seller doesn't understand it, though, like, at least conceptually, like, yes, with open projects. And that it's different than working capital, right? Like working capital is one conversation, and when we calculate working capital, we remove cash, debt, and debt like items.

So it's a separate, separate, um, piece of the equation. Uh, so you want to figure out what is that WIP figure, and make sure that the [01:12:00] seller does understand at least conceptually, I have to give the cash that I've received for work I haven't done to you. Um, now, It's not always cash, sometimes it's just a reduction in purchase price, but with this deal size, a lot of times it is cash because Steve is a buyer.

Maybe aren't capitalized enough to just like take the hit of just having a lower, uh, purchase price of the deal if you want the cash to fund that on the projects. 

**Athena:** Amazing. This has been so cool. At least I've been fascinated and enjoyed every minute. I don't know how other people feel about QBs, but I think it's fascinating.

And the stuff that Chris does and also like what I love about this, like, yes, it is a another deal expense, but my God, like having that kind of confidence and. Team looking through all of the numbers in a way that, like, most of us don't have that kind of sophisticated financial. Analysis ability, you know, so that, like, peace of mind.

Like, if there's nothing wrong in the report, [01:13:00] that peace of mind is worth, worth it, right? Even if nothing changes, the peace of mind that what you're buying is what you were told, you know, I, I, I, I talk about this a lot, you know, it's like, you can skip this, but like the, the, the, you shouldn't, right? It's, it's an expense and the peace of mind is worth it.

And then even in the example, like you said, best case scenario is Chris is going to find a whole bunch of. Adjustments that, you know, saves you from bankruptcy gets a much better deal. You know. Saves you money or, you know, a lot of times they'll find things that the seller won't realize is like an extra money for you to write and you don't have to tell them that it's like extra ad box or extra things in there.

That is to your advantage. Once you take over the business. So, um, when you hire someone like Chris, you know, they're, they're working for you. Um, 1 thing [01:14:00] I was going to ask you actually, is, uh, you know, does it always necessarily order QV? But it sounds like they're happy with your report and maybe it's yet another, another vote of confidence in the deal when working with an SBA lender if, if getting a report from you.

**Chris:** Yeah, so SBA, um, doesn't always require a QV and sale. Most of the time I say they're not requiring one, it's the buyer that wants one for their own, uh, peace of mind and processes. Um, SBA underwrites heavily to the tax return. That's the most important thing for most SBA underwriting processes. Um, And yeah, I mean, obviously I'm biased, right?

But the texture oftentimes is not telling the whole story. Um, and so that's why I think a QB is going much beyond what a bank is actually doing in their processes. Um, Yeah, 

**Athena:** so this is a situational thing, but and, you know, in your experience, I know how I would kind of [01:15:00] advise negotiating it. But, like, let's say you're looking, it's very early on.

You haven't established a relationship. You notice that. There's an ad back for advertising or marketing and, you know, likely that's going to be an adjustment. Like, do you see people having success negotiating that up front or, or, you know, getting into a deal and then, like, having a report and being like, Hey, this really isn't a justifiable expense here and then retraining.

**Chris:** Yeah. Um, I'd say like, if you're looking at a SIM and you see stuff that immediately pumps out or jumps out as like. This, this seems like it wouldn't be legitimate. Um, I think it's a good idea to at least ask the question, like, what, you know, what was the thought process behind this back and ask that at this time?

It's going to save you deal costs. Like, if it is something that's just. I don't agree. We're gonna have to adjust that figure and do it now. Um, and then if they're like, yeah, that's, [01:16:00] I don't agree. And I'm not going to sell it at that price. Um, well, then, you know, you can lose didn't spend any money on anything.

I'll give you can do that. Some of that sniffing around their proposed ad backs. Um, before getting under a lie, you know, just saves you time and headache for sure. 

**Athena:** How often do you see burgers? Adding things back to try to, like, boost the numbers, knowing that it's probably going to be knocked back down.

**Chris:** Yeah, this is actually something I see. Very frequently if there's a sell side QOV and so This is sell side QOVs are more common on Larger deals than they are on smaller deals like SBA side deals, but you do see them But the way you think about it like a sell side QOV costs more than a buy side typically So if you're getting a sell side QOV even on a small deal like a you know, five ten million dollar deal You probably spent forty grand on it.

So they just [01:17:00] spent 40, 000 Making their financials look as good as possible and that doesn't necessarily mean that Everything in there is, is legitimate, right? Like, you have to go through those adjustments and, and really scrutinize them even more because you're now going up to bat against someone who is, you have someone on the other side of the table who's done hundreds of deals versus you, like, you're not just going against a seller who's doing their first deal.

You're going up against a firm that does hundreds of deals and, and has a CPA and has their team or whatever. Um, So it becomes that much more important when they've had a sell side report on some of my biggest adjustments have been when they were in the sell side, uh, QV done and there's been times when I'm going through it and I'm like, so what was like the thought process behind it?

And the guy where he just says, like, well, I didn't expect you to accept everything, you know, like, like those tell you, like, you know, they don't, um, you know, [01:18:00] they're kind of 

**Athena:** adding it back and hoping that some unsavvy buyer doesn't catch it. 

**Chris:** Yeah, because, I mean, their job, like, their job is to. Represent the seller and they're not it's stuff that might be on the margin, right?

Like I'm on the buyer side a lot of time, but we do, we didn't sell side projects to, but most of our projects on the buy side and I'm, I'm biased towards buyer. So, like, it was something the edge, I'm going to look at it and say. We're, we're going to throw this out, like we're not going to include this or we're going to adjust down for this reason, that thing that we found, um, the seller, the sell side QE provider, and do the opposite, right?

They want to make it look as good as possible. They want to kind of be more biased towards the sell side. Um, and that's just the way that it's going to go. And then you kind of battle and, and, and meet in the middle. Um, with brokers, you do see that. I'd say the bigger problem with brokers oftentimes is that they're not diving into anything.

Right, they're taking tax return, if you're [01:19:00] lucky, or they're just taking the books and they're like, all right, meals, uh, salary, um, you know, seller, is there anything else you can think of? And the seller's like, oh, advertising, you know, whatever, right? And they just list out a couple of things and then they'll write it down and add it back.

Some will dig a little bit deeper, but it's usually like it's pretty surface level on a lot of the times when you're getting brokers to add things back. Um, and so I'd say that's, there's some brokers that might be like really hunting for, uh, ad backs and trying to throw things on there that aren't, I think, but a lot of times it's just like more, it's not even laziness.

It's just not their job, right? It's not their job to like verify every single thing. That the, uh, that the seller tells them, um, it's kind of taking it at face value. What does the tax return say? Does it make sense to me? Okay, let's put it in the report. It 

**Athena:** should be their job.

Oh, this has been great. [01:20:00] Chris, I've been hogging the mic as usual. So if anybody has any questions, even if it's like, specific to a deal that you saw, or something that you've seen, um, feel free to jump in. While while we're waiting for y'all to think of questions, if you have them, Chris, can you think of any I love hearing the kind of like horror stories or, like, the things that you're just like wild because you have a lot of any come to mind that are fun to share and also a word of caution or happiness.

Maybe. 

**Chris:** Um, yeah, I mean, I think like the most horror story that keeps coming to, like, back of my mind is maybe like six months ago or so. I might have even told this story last time, but we had a guy that, uh Came to us, was recommended to get a QV from a lender that we work with a lot. Um, we started the process for QV, seller decided he didn't want to do one, so he pushed back on the buyer and said, Don't get one, you don't need one, um, you can use my lender, [01:21:00] uh, this deal's gonna be fine, um, trust me bro.

And the, uh, buyer decided, okay, I'm gonna save the money, I'm not gonna do one. Um, and six weeks into the, after owning the business, he, uh, called me up and said, I'm going to go bankrupt. Um, actually, that was even worse. He didn't even know what a PG really was, but when he signed it, he thought he was going to lose a million bucks and then found out later, like, I had to be able to tell him, like, you're going to lose your house and your car and everything.

Um. So, definitely, if someone's pushing back on like having you not do diligence, right, like, that's a pretty big flag. Anytime there's being cagey about it, I got a deal that died, the same one that died yesterday I was talking about earlier. Um, it was like this whole thing about this difference in the tax return in the books, we were asking about it, it was over a month.

We were pushing on it and they're just like Katie dodging, wouldn't answer, couldn't connect with the accountant, have to have a lawyer in the conversation, like all this weird stuff. And eventually [01:22:00] if, if, if they're just being weird about things, like you don't want to take that risk. And, uh, that's ultimately why our client ended up walking away.

Cause it's just someone's not being open upfront with you. Uh, yeah, it means there's probably hiding something that, that you don't want to uncover after you, you know. 

**Athena:** Very well to end it on a lighter note percentage of your deals. Would you say that was actually like fraud versus errors, you know, like, like human errors versus fraud?

**Chris:** Yeah, yeah. And I, there's a, I'd say there's some people with space to use the fraud term pretty loosely of like every time. And I don't like ultimately like. Right. Like they're, they, they know, right. They know that if they get a higher number on that, you get a competition, they get paid more. So I do think that some of like the fear around it, like is maybe justified where you do need to make sure that you [01:23:00] understand this business and don't give the seller, don't let them just slide by with everything.

Like, Oh, uh, like, like this is important. Like these financials need to be right. Um, but I do think a lot of it. What you find is just, you know, they're, they're screwing things up because they don't know how to do accounting. Like, if they wanted to do things, like, especially on like working capital, like if they wanted to get pulled a little over your eyes on working capital, like I don't think they know where to start in a lot of cases, um, because it is not sophisticated enough.

Um, but you still have to be on the lookout and you definitely want to verify those errors that they're making because those errors, even if they're making them innocently, could be Hundreds of thousands, if not more in enterprise value. Um, and so whether committing fraud or not, like you definitely verify, I'd say of the deals we do, maybe, uh, somewhere in the 60 to 70 percent end up closing.

So, like, you know, 40 30 percent the deals end up [01:24:00] dying for one reason or another. Um, of those that are like, Um, I think the seller is sketchy and doing something maybe, you know, that they shouldn't be doing. And they know that they shouldn't be doing it. Uh, it's hard to put a number to it. Um, cause sometimes you don't know and you find something like, are you, are you scummy?

Like that loan payment, like, did he know that like, you know, it was, what's 

**Athena:** your, what's your gut though? Like how many are actually sketchy? I don't, 

**Chris:** I don't know. I mean, I'm just too trusting, maybe five, 10 percent maybe, you know, actually trying to do something where they know what they're doing is wrong.

But at the core, like they all, they all know if they put a dollar even on, they get 4 back. They all know that. Yeah. So like, you talk about like my bias versus sell side QB providers bias, like, you know, we might like, here's the truth. And then like, we're like, right on the outside of it, seller is like [01:25:00] bias.

In their direction as advice that you can get, right? Because it just that's the way that they're going to tell. Um, and so you just have to be aware of that, that even if something's on the edge, it's falling. They want it to fall in their direction and they're going to spin it in their direction. 

Yeah, 

**Chris:** and yeah, of course, I 

**Athena:** think it's important like, so, you know.

There's a lot of distrust, you know, there's a lot of noise out there, like, brokers are, you know, liars and sellers are, you know, everyone's a liar. And it's like, I think there's an important distinction between, like, error, which. You still want something like you to catch that error. So you don't end up putting yourself in a situation where versus like, legit sketchy.

They're trying to hide something for you. And in the middle there, it's somebody trying to get a good deal. We're all negotiating. I want to get rewarded. Like, that's understandable. You know, as long as it's not completely out of integrity, like, hiding things from you [01:26:00] to get a better situation. Um, you know, or intentionally lying or whatever.

So that's why I wanted to tease the part. It's, it's, you know, you being on the buy side where you're biased towards the buyer saying like 5 to 10 percent of sellers are like sketchy. So, that's like 90 percent that are trying to get a good deal and make errors, you know, like, we're humans running accounting in a small business is not an easy thing to do.

Um, but. That's why making sure, like, the bank's not going to, there's some communities and stuff, which some people here belong to, where they're saying the bank's going to do diligence for you, you don't need a QV, and I think that's categorically wrong. I will always, always, always tell all of you to get a QV before you purchase, because Chris is going to be able to.

Or, you know, whomever you use, we love Chris because we know he does amazing work, but to catch those errors so that you don't end up putting yourself in the seat of something where you're not going to have enough money to make [01:27:00] ends meet, or it's not what you believe it was and, you know, your return isn't going to be the same.

So, having that peace of mind that this is coming down the track before you purchase the business. Should make y'all feel good, but also, you know, um, small percentage are going to be trying to commit fraud or flat out. Why do you want it to end on a happier? No, this is amazing. Chris, as always love, uh, you spending time and taking people through this.

I hope this was beneficial for all of you that joined us today and are going to be. Ticking into the replay to actually see what this report looks like and hear even more about the financial due diligence process as you, you know, make, which is 1 of the biggest, serious, most, you know, impactful life purchases that you might make as you go through this.

So, um. We'll be [01:28:00] putting the recording up on the, um, uh, platform for you all again with Chris's details. So when you're getting to the point where you want to start talking to him, like, assigned or maybe just before, um, they are great to talk to and engage with as you're going through this process. Um, I think we're actually going to have, did we confirm Mathias next week?

Mathias is going to be coming through and talking. Um, he's an SBA broker. Actually, that's how we found Chris. Uh, so they work together in a bunch of deals, but Mathias is one of the. Kind of best known and most effective brokers out there. So he's gonna be coming and talking next week. Um, we also have our friend who I'm just finalizing times with him, but, um, he's 1 and a half years into a 6Million dollar acquisition and he's going to be talking through his experience as well.

So, Chris, really appreciate you as always. Thank you so much. Anything else you want to say before we sign off. 

**Chris:** No, thanks so [01:29:00] much for having me. This is great. Well, uh, yeah, welcome. Welcome to reach out. If anyone's got any questions afterwards, happy to be resource for you guys. 

**Athena:** Amazing. Thanks so much. Chris.

Appreciate it. And have a great rest of your day and weekends. Everybody. 

**Chris:** Bye.
