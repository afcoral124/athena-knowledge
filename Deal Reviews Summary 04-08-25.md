  I mean, I knew you're there, but I haven't mentioned it. So where in Mexico are you? You're in Mexico City?

0:05 - Luke Gillespie
  Mexico City, yes.

0:07 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  When did you get there?

0:09 - Luke Gillespie
  Saturday, Saturday night.

0:11 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  How does it go in?

0:12 - Luke Gillespie
  It's great. It's really cool. I'm happy to be here, like I was telling the team before, but I haven't really done anything.  I've just been moving in and getting all the essentials, like bed sheets and soap and pillows.

0:23 - David R
  I was on David.

0:24 - Luke Gillespie
  I think I found a shared office and a gym that I'm going to go check out after my broker call today.  I'm going to sign those up. Hopefully, I don't want to be stuck in my room. So I'm just these two days in my room.  Hopefully, by tomorrow, I'll be working in office.

0:37 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  But I don't know about life.

0:39 - Luke Gillespie
  Here go.

0:40 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  I know it's so exciting.

0:42 - Luke Gillespie
  I can't wait. I have a local friend here. I'm going to see one of my best friends. Actually, he's a pro-tenant.  He played a tournament on Sunday here in Mexico City, so I went and got to watch him play. it's been good so far.

0:55 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Awesome. Well, I know that well. into a place and having to get everything set up so you can work, you know, but you tend to get it into a pretty like dialed in process.  my God, I travel with so much stuff, you know, everything that I need. So like even going to Dallas for a couple days, it was a big huge suitcase, you know, I was like, I need my whole work set up and you know, my protein powder, all my supplements, because when you live on the road, you know, you need those things to like take care of yourself, as opposed to like somebody's just going on vacation, I'd be like, I can leave that out.

1:30 - Luke Gillespie
  it's like a whole different, my boyfriend thinks I'm crazy when I go down there with like a huge suitcase for two days.

1:37 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  But yeah, yeah, that's cool. Well, it's like stuff. And I haven't had a social catch up with you for a second.

1:47 - David R
  How's life with me? Oh, it's good. Everything's good, right? I'm just, I don't do much like I just live in my life with my wife.  we have a dog so we just take care of the dog.

2:04 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay, I didn't know you were married so there we go, what's your wife's name?

2:10 - David R
  It's it's her in English in Spanish is Paola.

2:14 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Paola, amazing how long have you been married?

2:18 - David R
  Three years now.

2:19 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Wow, that's cool. Does Paola work?

2:24 - David R
  Take a no she works, she works at a pharmaceutical company. What is called? It's a French company.

2:32 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, she works there.

2:35 - David R
  She works in supply chain.

2:37 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  That's awesome.

2:38 - David R
  does a lot of stuff in logistics and so many things.

2:43 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Amazing. And what kind of dog?

2:48 - David R
  We have a coca spaniel. Yeah, it's so cute. I actually wanted a bigger dog. wife was like, no, I don't like big dogs.  has to be a small one. Okay. Okay, that's I agree with Paula.

3:04 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  My boyfriend and I are moving into a house on Monday. And he's got two huge dogs. They're huge to me like my whole life.  I grew up with little like teacup noodles, you know, one point I had a miniature poodle who was 15 pounds and that was like the largest dog I ever had.  So these ones are like 80, 90 pound beasts.

3:26 - David R
  Yeah, nice. That's the kind of dog that I wanted to do. So we're going to the boy.

3:35 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  I can get you all to come to success and hang out with my dogs. Our first purchase together, which he didn't have a choice about was one of those robot vacuum cleaner.

3:50 - Luke Gillespie
  But they're they're mops now too, which I didn't realize.

3:54 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Like, yeah, they've got like combination vacuum cleaner mop. And he's like, I didn't realize it was so expensive. Like, I'm telling you, this is gonna save so many fights.

4:03 - David R
  Like, I do not want hair anywhere, right?

4:07 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  He's got like, every time I go to his house, I'm just covered with my hair.

4:10 - Luke Gillespie
  he's like, we just washed yesterday.

4:12 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  I'm like, no, you didn't. Seriously, like, they shed that much.

4:16 - David R
  We actually have one of these robots. We got like two months ago, and it's just amazing. It's the best, the best choice that you can make.  Like, it's just what you need to get, really.

4:27 - Luke Gillespie
  It's amazing.

4:27 - David R
  It works really, really well.

4:30 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  If you were playing floors, it just makes the whole house feel clean, you know? Yeah, exactly, yeah. And also, I like, I don't like walking around, and like, like, you know, my socks were just getting that pet hair in there.

4:41 - David R
  And it was like ruining my clothes. Like, yeah, so we had a lot of discussions about, like, no dogs in the bed.  Like, anyway.

4:50 - Luke Gillespie
  You want to see my mom? So you get these Clorox wipes. them on the floor. And you step and you just  running around your food because we can have this one small room so it's no, no point in getting a mballs actually really clever i use student of my apartment and college because it was mostly carpet the apartment but the kitchen was one little square room of heartless floor so no point in getting a moment, just get some Clorox wipes, step on it, just dribble around like I used to play soccer, but just this time it's with wipes on my feet instead of dribbling the soccer ball.

5:36 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Like the college version of a Swiffer a Mop. That's right. I make mops like that. It looks like no, I'm just gonna step on some Clorox wipes and get it done.

5:48 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah, that's awesome. I love it, I'm so middle-wollist.

5:53 - David R
  That's so funny.

5:55 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Well, cool. So, yeah. wanted to talk about a few things going on with the client, so see where we can get to with that.  And then, you know, any deals or anything that you guys wanted to talk through today, I have Ryan this week.  So, you know, if there's any deals you want to talk through, Luke, or things that you guys are going through, I know Oka is doing the daily meeting with you, so I cannot emphasize enough how important it is.  I know it's tedious to do the tracking and stuff like that, but we're at that stage in the business where it's like going to be really hard for us to move forward without getting clean data.  So, like, please work with her to, you know, keep it as clean as possible. It helps us with the clients.  It helps me with hiring decisions. It helps with figuring out stuff in the business. It's just like, and I know it sucks, but it helps so much.  So, thank you in advance for helping us through that, because we, We've never been at a point where we could get clean data, now we can, so.

7:03 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah, that's good. I know the value of it, and hopefully we'll get it automated soon, so we won't have to manual track everything.

7:11 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, I mean, there's stages that you do anyway, so like it takes an input for it to know that an action has happened.  Yeah. So there's only so much automation we can make. Like, I like it is like a little like I checked my box on this part of the.  You know, and everything that you guys have done, I did myself, right? So like the deal pipeline and it's like, okay, I had a broker call and now I need to like market broker completed like that to me was like checking the box that like I completed the task.  So it's like, I just made it a part of the task, you know, it didn't feel complete. And then for me, I don't like going into the pipeline and seeing things undone and things that I didn't do.  So like I look at the pipeline every day. Sales pipeline and hub spot. guess what, guess who gets to like mark all the things that I did in the sale.  pipeline because if I don't know where a client's at or what they're what they've done, so it's like how is the pipeline going to know if I had a call with someone, you know, or how is the pipeline going to know if somebody submitted an ally?

8:15 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah, exactly.

8:18 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So some stuff has to be us, but if you like reframe it is like this is me completing a task, then hopefully that helps, you know.

8:27 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah, exactly.

8:29 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Cool. Okay, so let me just pull out my list really quick about what we needed to go off. Alright, um, like I said, Chris said something in Slack, I told Luke to bring it up.

8:44 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah, well, I know what that was in reference to. Yeah, of course. I wrote down a short list as well for things I wanted to talk about.

8:50 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  I just put right. Well, why don't why don't you take us through your list and then I just want to make sure we're covering off client stuff.  Just candidly, I am really struggling trying to fit 10 client meetings into my work week and because I'm in back-to-back meetings, I don't see the channels and I'm still struggling to catch up with like all the deals on everybody's plate.  I kind of got the information a little bit late. just to let you know, I'm trying, but I appreciate y'all kind of helping us through this because we want everybody to take a vacation.  Yeah, I know.

9:28 - Luke Gillespie
  Anka told me I shouldn't be flagging things in the channel more for you, so I'm going to wear to her to flag TV exactly.

9:35 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, I unfortunately, because I'm in the meetings, I get notified on everything in Slack, so I only go in there like if somebody tells me to.  So Anka's got the, there's one app messaging thing that I leave open because that's where she tells me like, this is important, good deal with it now.  So unless I get a message from her, I just kind of review Slack when I get a moment, which leaves me.  it's like never. So if there's anything like super urgent, then yeah, like tagging me is guaranteed. I won't see it until whenever open up Slack.  So if it's something that's like urgent, getting on get involved is a good move.

10:13 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah, exactly. All right. I'm trying to take more of the client communications on Slack. So you don't have to do as much work under your overload with Ryan missing.

10:22 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  But okay, I also like, I want to, you know, if it's if it's a if if it's something you haven't encountered yet, and it's like the matter of a deal getting done or an all while you're getting submitted, I absolutely want to be involved.  But it's just like in order to keep my head in whatever I'm doing, I kind of have to manage it that way.  So that's why I leave that channel open with her, because she can she can decide whether something's like super urgent or not and get a hold of me to deal with it because I'll I'll make time if I need to like with Gil.  He's like, can I talk to you about this deal? like, is this like competitive time sensitive? Oh, it can wait until Friday.  Great. If not, I will make my evening time available. for clients, you know, the time you will see the similar deals that you like get involved with, like, especially on market competitive ones, like, yeah, move  quick, you know, so like us not responding to a client quickly is the matter of them, like losing a deal sometimes.

11:16 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah, exactly. Yep. True.

11:21 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Cool. Well, why don't you go through your list?

11:24 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah, sorry.

11:25 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  if you guys don't mind, I'm going to eat my lunch while while we do this to go ahead.

11:32 - Luke Gillespie
  So I was I was looking at the fathom notes of the call you did with Jason today, I believe, and it sounds like because when I think about AA and BH, they're definitely done and JB, I mean, we got him the perfect opportunity and he's he's done.  So there's no chance for those three, but it sounds like from the call today, Jason, if we really wow him and get him some good deals, he's pretty open to staying on and continuing.

11:53 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yep.

11:54 - Luke Gillespie
  Okay. Yeah, I was going to bring that up to the team tomorrow morning to try to wild Jason this  one. Okay. And then that CM deal that I'll go ahead and mentioned. It was a roofing company and he just messaged here.
  ACTION ITEM: Expand Jason's deal search criteria. Incl. 3-4hr radius, relocatable biz, strong systems/processes. Add Savannah + other city Anka will provide. - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/270847222?timestamp=726.9999

12:08 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Pause. Yes.

12:09 - Luke Gillespie
  On Jason. We're expanding his deal box.

12:17 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Geography. So he's like, I feel like there should be more deals. And I was like, well, the only lever we can pull to get you more deals to geography.  Because like, correct me if I'm wrong, but he has a pretty tight geography. So it's been dependent on that.  So I got him to agree to look at businesses like three to four hours away from where he's at.  If there is the potential for them to be relocated, strong like systems and processes in place that if he wasn't there all the time that it would be okay.  So these are going to be larger deals, right? With the potential that it could possibly be relocated in the future.  So if it's a business that's not dependent on the location, it just happened.

13:00 - David R
  happens to be there. Okay. Then we can consider it.

13:04 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  But see if that helps. Obviously, David, you're going to be the one most impacted with that, with like seeing if that helps us get more good quality deals.
  ACTION ITEM: Expand Jason's deal search. Look at entire state, region. Consider deals w/o specific location listed. Use Kumo for broader search. - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/270847222?timestamp=797.9999  Do you have any questions about those specifics and like what you should be looking at? Is that pretty clear in terms of how to look at businesses far away from him?

13:28 - David R
  Sorry, I guess I'm just going to look at the map and try to expand his search around his location.  And then I can go ahead and visit myself and try to find something that matches this criteria.

13:44 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Great. then he mentioned Savannah and another city in that. So Anka can get you the names of it in the replay.  Yeah, she shouldn't have shared that one with you guys. So I didn't know. what she did. Um, where is she with that Luke?

14:03 - Luke Gillespie
  No, the call knows that Eda does in the client channels for every call.

14:07 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Oh, okay. Um, right. Got it. Okay. Um, so yeah, there's specific cities that he mentioned. Um, then, you know, something that was like, like what Lindsay and Kevin are doing with their media business as like, the owners insisted that it can't be a remote business, but they're just like old school, right?

14:31 - Luke Gillespie
  Like, it's immediate business.

14:33 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  They can do it remotely. So they, you know, Kevin's been temporary, living down there and then like in the commuting, like in between the weeks and stuff like that, but Jason's like, I don't want to be home with my family every day or like, you know, not gone a long time.  So I just really needs to have those characteristics that it's like, this could be done anywhere, but the just chose to do it there.  So kind of thinking about like Andrew's business that he's going after, the owners happen to live in Canada. like, the business is American customers and American employees, which was with bonkers, but the guy just happened to live in Canada.  So I often feel like we're missing a trick on the deal flow side because say somebody is like an online business in, don't know, Montana, their family friend is going to recommend that they go speak to the local business broker in Montana, local business broker in Montana is going to list it as a Montana business, even though it's a remote business.  So I'll plant that seed and I'm sure you're already thinking about it, but I just keep thinking like what are we missing because we're not looking across the US for these opportunities, like these brokers that just are  at marketing and  don't realize how severely they're limiting the potential buyers because they're listing it as a city or a county or redacting the location altogether.  And this was just confirmed by the the brokers at this event. That often it's the request of the seller to keep the location private.  So even like if Jason's looking at Atlanta, are we looking at all of Georgia, you know, because the seller might not want to be identified.  it's more of a rhetorical question. Maybe you guys are always already doing this, but it's something on my mind a lot that I wonder if we're missing opportunities because we're doing what everybody else is doing, just looking at exactly what we're looking for, location wise.

16:49 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah.

16:53 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  What do you think David?

16:56 - David R
  Yeah, I mean, we usually have like some deals. in the not client location much and sometimes they say like relocatable or online businesses and what I try to do is try to match these deals with different clients depending on you know the type of business so we have something there but probably there are some more business around America around us that we are missing so yeah those are only coming in when somebody doesn't put a location on right it just happens in live our channels but like us actually making like extending the search criteria to be all of Georgia you know even though we know they're looking at Atlanta because the broker might have just put George on there a lot of times also like benchmark does this all the time they're like in the southeast of the US like they won't even identify the state so what how are we incorporating that into our search that we're not like missing these business

18:00 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  is because we're being so specific on the geolocation.

18:11 - David R
  Yeah, I think we might have to ask, you know, don't archive those businesses, but push it and try to ask the broker what is the specific location of this, you know?  So we don't lose track of those businesses, we don't lose it. Because just because they don't say the specific location.  And actually, I've seen some businesses like that, like, if I don't find the exact location, I put some notes for the look, and I say like to confirm exact location in Florida, for example, because there are some businesses that say Florida, but they don't say the exact location.  So this is something I'm doing right now, like, I don't, you know, skip, obviously, just because they don't say the specific location, try to push even more if they are good businesses.  Like, I see they have, you know, high cash flow and they're, know, good industry. I tried to push it and then we try to find out what is the exact location for this specific business.

19:12 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, but correct me if I'm wrong, we might be filtering them out before they even hit our inbox correct because of the search criteria that we set up in the search parameters.

19:23 - David R
  Yeah, maybe, maybe some of them, yeah.

19:26 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So like, are we doing statewide searches for every single client also or regional, like how do you even account for regional, right?  benchmark always says like southeast or northwest, like they don't even give a state. So if we're thinking about that and the deal team's only importing deals that hit the inbox.  Yeah, so if unless we've got them scraping all of the broker sites, which, you know, ideally they're doing that too.  I don't know if that's happening, but I feel like we might be missing potentially really great opportunities because we're limiting our deal flow with the search parameters that we set.  We're not even getting a look at it because we weeded it out before it even hits the inbox.

20:15 - David R
  Yeah, maybe. I mean, for some clients, I also have the state. So I think, for example, for Jason, I also, I do have Georgia in East Coast, be it by sale.  So we don't miss anything in Georgia, especially for him because the deal flow for him has been really low recently.  when I expanded searches, I tried to add your Georgia and counties and different type of searches. So I don't miss good deals just because we're meeting the searches.  Are we still using Kumo too? Yeah, was love.

20:58 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay. Oh, um, awesome. So let's get Jason's criteria expanded ASAP. See if we can nail it with a couple other really great deals this month.  Otherwise, um, you know, he's potentially ending services. So he hasn't told the end of the month, at least for the notice that he's given.

21:19 - David R
  So we want to know how you know, absolutely.

21:25 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  All right, Luke. Cool. What's next? And just you know, you know, I interact with Brian all the time. So, and you too.  So after each client pause, let me be back.

21:38 - Luke Gillespie
  Okay. Um, the CM thing, the CM deal that I mentioned to you, it's a deal. He just sent a message in the slide channel saying that the broker is saying SP is likely not an option.  So CM's kind of, uh, it out right now, but I was thinking you might want to hop on a call with their message and tell them there's other options, right?  There's other ways. Don't just automatically, uh,

23:00 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  is it?

23:01 - Luke Gillespie
  It's in Colorado and I didn't read it.

23:04 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  It's what is it? It's a roof and company.

23:07 - Luke Gillespie
  They do like right when the hail destroys roofs in Colorado, they replace the roofs.

23:13 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay. And when you spoke to the broker, did you ask what SBA lender didn't approve it?

23:22 - Luke Gillespie
  I didn't ask Wishlender no, but he did go into detail for like from minutes talking about the whole explanation now that I had back to being recognized.

23:30 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay. So somebody can help me and Ryan Luke in the upfront getting more details about that.

23:40 - Luke Gillespie
  There's 4,000 SBA lenders. 4,000.

23:45 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Right. So oftentimes, and this is what our buyers do. It's like sometimes what we do. A lender will say no and we make an assumption it's an SBA when actually it's a lender now.

23:58 - Luke Gillespie
  Exactly.

23:59 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah. And you understand. Stand the difference between those two.

24:01 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah, because every lender varies, you know, they're all SDA lenders, they have different types of risk different in the shoes.

24:09 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Right, so when you're on the broker call that can help the buyer and us, like rather than us sending the buyer to go and get that information.  If they're not pre-qualled, can you be like, can you give me a little bit more details about that? what specifically or like, do you know what lender said that, like wasn't an SBA thing or a lender thing?  If the broker doesn't know, then it could be a lender thing, right?

24:32 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah, exactly.

24:34 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So just digging a little bit more into like, what about it? What ad-backs were not agreed upon? So it's like, well, if the guy's adding questionable ad-backs back, nobody's gonna buy at that purchase price, if nobody agrees with that ad-backs.

24:49 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah, exactly.

24:52 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  what ad-back, yeah, like did you get the information on the ad-backs? Or does Chris have that, do you know?

25:00 - Luke Gillespie
  I'm looking here, I think I'm sure I asked about it on the call and he vocabally didn't have much details.  Oh, this is it. Yeah. Okay. remember. So this owner is apparently paying himself sales commissions. And in 2024, it was 622 K at that sales commissions.  And, uh, that's a nine in that six hundred twenty degree out of the nine hundred twenty five SDE. Um, I, I, I would need to re listen to the call to hear the brokers words.  just have the right up hold in front of me. reading the notes. wrote down. But yeah, I definitely would have asked about that.  Because yeah, I've never seen really sales commissions being used as an ad back. Maybe I have rarely a couple of times actually, but that much is.

25:54 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  There can be validated that it's owner income though. Like, how does it matter what he's paying himself? Um, exactly.

26:01 - Luke Gillespie
  And that's why I'm saying I don't want Chris to be giving up too easy, like, because you never know, maybe this broker passed it by one, one lender, the most conservative risk of risk lender.

26:10 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  And these are the ads. How time sensitive is this? there a lower competition on it?

26:19 - Luke Gillespie
  Uh, so the broker claimed they already had a couple of LIs in hand, but they were both contingent on those SBA problems.  So it looks like those LIs and we can use SBA as well. And now he's telling Chris, yeah, SBA is likely not going to be an option.  So.

26:37 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  We have time. Is it because we didn't record it on his taxes? Is that the problem? Um, I don't remember.

26:45 - Luke Gillespie
  We didn't get tax returns.

26:47 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  All I was told was just, yeah, they're not recognizing so many that. I don't have those specifics. Okay. question for you.  Are you asking for tax returns on these broker falls?

26:58 - Luke Gillespie
  Not always know a lot of. The deal files already include them, sometimes they don't, and I don't ask them.

27:04 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay, can you please start asking about that too? Because why do you think I'm asking for the tax returns, or why do you think that's important?

27:14 - Luke Gillespie
  So we can verify the numbers and know that the broker isn't bullshitting us?

27:19 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Well, it's not just bullshitting, like what's necessary to get financials.

27:22 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah, SBA, you need the tax returns.

27:24 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Exactly. So if what they're saying is there, it needs to be on the tax returns. If it's not on the tax returns, they're not going to get the price that they want.  just adding to your list to ask if you can get tax returns, or especially since we're now in April, just like have they done their 2024?  Where are they out with that? Have a couple of friendly questions about the tax returns. But you can say, hey, our buyers like to  quick with getting financing sorted out. So our tax returns available. So then it's almost like to their benefit, right?  It's like, hey, we've got, you know, you've already seen the prequel from my book, we've got really great lenders.  So providers like to move fast and like, you know, be able to give you confidence they can get it financed.  So like, if they haven't already provided tax returns, like then you can say like that, like, you know, you have the tax returns available, last year's tax returns.  And they're like, no, they haven't done it. you can be like, gosh, that must be frustrating for you. But you get asked it all the time.  Like, when do you think they're going to be done with it? Like getting all the information helps the clients because they're going to have to ask for it anyway.

28:40 - Luke Gillespie
  Like that is a, so what are we trying to do?

28:43 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  trying to get people under offer and closing, right? How can we do that quicker? Right? Yeah, asking all the questions that they don't necessarily know to ask and or like might forget to ask.  And it's sooner we can do that and get more of that stuff covered off the more we can prep them for.  Hey, they haven't done the 2024 tax returns. So that's something that you're going to have to like, you know, get from them immediately because the SBA is probably going to want that.

29:10 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah, yeah, exactly, got it.

29:15 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So for this, this message on section, I leave that for you to respond and maybe she has no call with him or, um, we've already, oh , he missed his call yesterday.

29:26 - Luke Gillespie
  That's what it's like, um, he, he said he was in a buyers club session because uncle was like, Hey, can you guys, you guys want to talk about things on buyers club?  He said he'll join Thursdays. And this, this brokers telling Chris, we would need some indication by the end of the week, even just at a high level price structure, how the deal will be fine is, how are you thinking about financing deal after speaking with them, the sellers, I'm assuming SBA is likely out for this one is what the brokers saying.

30:00 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay um I will try to give it a look today so just so you guys know tomorrow um I'm in interviews all morning and then I'm going to speak at the executive MBA program in the afternoon so I'm pretty much out tomorrow um so as much as you guys can chat amongst yourselves uncle will be online tomorrow too like just like what do you think about this we're a holding pattern or so do you see what I'm doing every time a client say something I'm like how time sensitive is it competitive so that I can make a decision on like do I move things around do I cancel something do I tell them to wait etc etc so like gauging the urgency is really helpful too yeah exactly in this one it's it's probably not that urgent I mean the broker saying end week but like the financing is going to be an issue in some way so if Chris can join fires club then we can talk about it because it's going to be useful for everybody to hear so um leave it with us  if you're like, how we kind of think about things. And then also, if you guys can, you're seeing a client ask a question that you don't know the answer to, then either.  And then like, hey, what's the kind of time sensitivity on this? Like, has a broker told you? Not a time and we'll, we'll, you know, follow up with thing.  So you can always send a holding message, ask for information that will help you. And again, you know, I'm going to ask that.  Right. So really get that information up front. So then you can be like, Hey, Athena, they got us a minute off for tomorrow.  And I'm like, Oh, . Okay. Let me not eat dinner and talk to them instead. Yeah.

31:41 - Luke Gillespie
  Got it. No, I get what you're saying. I'll think about that before sliding anything to you mentioned the urgency of it.

31:48 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah. So like you have more, you have way more details about these deals than I do. And you can kind of like age it and or go back to the client be like, Hey, I'm going to chat with Athena in the meantime.  Can you tell me like to the broker to, know, so like ask the question and you can say like, I'm actioning this.  We've seen it. We're doing something about it. Give me some more info. And then I can get you like an answer.

32:11 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah, you don't have to give the answer in that regard.

32:13 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  But it feels good as a client and go, okay, cool. And you're collecting the information that you know I'm going to ask you anyway.

32:20 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah, exactly. Got it. All right. So I'm going to see the message to you and be ready next time.  Okay. Next, I want to talk about the BH message that I know you noticed. Yeah.

32:32 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yes, you're right.

32:33 - Luke Gillespie
  We never let any clients go 24 without any message being responded. We always respond promptly. Just that one was just happened this once because this happened before where I present a write up and a loom video to BH.  And he literally just does not read the right. He doesn't click on any of the links and he starts asking questions in the Slack channel that is clearly detailed in the write up in the video.  Like last time it was, it was so bad he was asking questions and was probably

33:00 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  within the first two minutes of the Loom video. So Ryan, like, what am I supposed to do with this guy, right?

33:05 - Luke Gillespie
  He's just asking questions that are already in the video. And so Ryan had instructed me, um, just, just tell him, hey, I did my best to cover all this in the Loom video and write out, please review those.  And if you have any additional questions, schedule call with Ryan, and he can address them, right? So that was what Ryan said, get him on a call at top of Ryan, because else he's going to be, I'm going to be going back and forth, spending all my time on Slack, messaging him, answering questions that have already been answered in the write up.  So he kind of did this again with this deal. It looks like he actually dug into this deal more than the other one.  It was an e-commerce company that sells car parts and because Brian's really into cars and automotive mechanic industry. So we thought, maybe this would be a good deal from, so we put it in front of him.  It's a website closed with his deal. It's an e-commerce company. But the warehouse is located in Ohio. And the first thing he says is, this looks like an awesome company, but I can't move to Ohio.  And so then I did the one response like, hey, Ryan, it's an e-commerce company. company, the warehouse is just located in Ohio, you can operate a remotely from anywhere.  And then he said, Oh, I was reading in the reviews that the owner is actually there, they're seeing him in person.  And so, yeah, then I just, I just left it, I was going to bring it up to you to see if you want to schedule a call with him because he's kind of the same situation as before with Brian.
  ACTION ITEM: Draft resp to BH re e-commerce deal. Acknowledge research, push for broker call to verify assumptions. Send to Athena for approval. - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/270847222?timestamp=2052.9999  So that's where we're at with that. You have any thoughts, concerns?

34:23 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Is that your best solution that I should get on a call with him?

34:28 - Luke Gillespie
  That, that was Ryan's best solution from last time we did it. I guess I could direct him again and respond again to him.  No, it's a verified e-commerce company. Please review the right up in the Loom video. And if you still have additional questions, then you could get on a call with him or Ryan is.

34:51 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So, is he is he in fact correct that people have wrote reviews about meeting with the person, the owner in person?

34:59 - Luke Gillespie
  I found a Google review. on that when I looked it up on Google and I saw reviews saying that like they brought their cars in and got it fixed.  But I was not mentioning the sim or the broker call at all. I'm from the broker calling the sim, it was all about selling these car parts.

35:14 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah. Okay, so he brought something out that you did not in fact address in the write up.

35:20 - Luke Gillespie
  Exactly. Yeah.

35:22 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay, so that's a little bit of a different conversation than Brian's not reading the write up, isn't it?

35:27 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah, I see. I know he did dig into this one more than other ones.

35:31 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yes. Okay, so he's doing what you ask him to do and he read the reviews and it said that there was like a physical presence by the owner.  So I don't think that's fair to him and since to say that he's not reading the write-ups and use that as like get on a call with Athena.

35:47 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah.

35:48 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Right. Can you see where I'm pointing that out?

35:51 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah, I get what you're saying. But I mean, I did say in a little video that the warehouse is in Ohio and then it isn't an e-commerce company and he was still reading like over.  I can't move to aye, I can't to aye.

36:02 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  But he has a good point. Why is it that the owner is getting name checked on Google reviews when people brought their, like, went and physically visited him?

36:17 - Luke Gillespie
  I would have the same question if I saw that.

36:24 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So that's not Brian not reading the reviews and complaining about something that's Brian pointing out something that is legitimately a concern that we did not address on the writeout by the sounds of it.  Sounds like we don't have an answer for it.

36:42 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah, I mean, it wasn't mentioned the same at all in the broker call, right? a website closer to what I would have just assumed it was automatically all of these e-commerce sales.  Like, if this wasn't mentioned at all in the same.

36:57 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  OK, so what is the usual thing?

37:00 - Luke Gillespie
  next step when we send a write up to somebody to introduce them to the broker to do a broker call for what what purpose so they can ask additional questions learn about the business yeah so with Brian's Ryan's and my very limited time yeah is this a situation that calls for either of us getting on a call no okay what do you think the next like how what how can we solve this problem introduce him to the broker to ask that question but how would you how would you respond to Brian right like how would be client servicing Luke respond to Brian I'll say good catch Brian that wasn't mentioned in the write-up or the broker call it all from our understanding was a straightforward e-commerce company I saw the the reviews you're mentioning that's interesting should I do you want to be introduced to the brokers you do a call of them and and ask about that well no you need to sign on the business

38:00 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  right like he's he's discounting it. So like what what do we what did we talk about like a week or two ago like we don't let clients cancel the deals right?

38:13 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah. So what do they need to do when they have concerns? We should push back on them respectfully.

38:23 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  But like what do we tell them to do when they when they're making assumptions about businesses?

38:29 - Luke Gillespie
  To wait to verify and put you get on the call to broker and ask them to verify the details.  Right. And what's every client going to do when they look at every single deal? Look at the Google reviews.

38:42 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Not just that but in general what are they going to do? They're going to find reasons to not move forward with it, right?  Yeah. So what's your job? What's Ryan's job? It's all of our jobs when they inevitably will find a reason not to move forward with it but we know it's in their best interest to move forward with it.

39:00 - Luke Gillespie
  Why? Because they would be better off as business owners and we need to find solutions to their problems that they're coming up with.

39:07 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Why is it important for them to get on these calls?

39:11 - Luke Gillespie
  Because then they will find out sometimes that some of their concerns weren't really valid and it wasn't that big of a concern and they'll get more information, they'll feel more comfortable and confident about the deal.

39:23 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah and overall why is it better for them to get on more calls?

39:27 - Luke Gillespie
  They also get more experience so they get closer, at the end of the day it gets closer to the closing of the deal.

39:33 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah so even though you've written Brian off, I understand why, he is doing what you asked him to do.  He did research on business. He found something that was in fact a concern, a valid one, which is good right but now it's like okay what does he need to do?  You've made an assumption so how Would you, if you had a Ryan or Athena on, how would you respond to him?

40:08 - Luke Gillespie
  I would push back and say, well, that's a good catch. As I said, right? It wasn't presented to us, but let's have you hop on a broken call to be able to ask that question.  Because I've seen Brian do it. got Jason Justin to flip around and do a broken call really easily. So he's pushed back on them respectfully and get them to a broken call.

40:27 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Right. So let me give you some language. I want you to write it up and then send it to me to sign off.  But like the more that you can block and tackle the clients, like the more time it saves for Ryan, how I do that, it's a really good skill to learn, right?  strongly, but gently managing clients. And it's a lifelong skill and I still don't get it right after 24 years, you know, but I've got a lot of experience handling clients.  So it's like paper. And I'm so glad you researched the business. Sounds like there's an interest there. We were reassured by the broker that this is a remote business.  So in this instance, we always like clients to verify assumptions because maybe the owner asked the local friends to leave good Google reviews, is often a play that owners will make.  So we have a good relationship with this broker. They only sell remote online businesses. If you like the business and you don't need to be in Ohio, is it something you would want to move forward?  If so, I would recommend we get you on a burger call so you can verify all those questions. And in the meantime, why don't you send us all of your other concerns and questions and we can help you with a, what do we do when clients get on a burger calls?

41:59 - Luke Gillespie
  I'll try questions. Exactly cool.

42:02 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So see how that feels different. Yeah, you're not using up me and Ryan's time for a conversation we don't need to have on the call.  We're rewarding and acknowledging the fact that he's taking the steps that we wanted him to do. We're also putting the work back on him, but not letting him off the hook.  Like you're coming up with something that in our conversations, this was not an issue. So we don't recommend that you completely discount it.

42:29 - Luke Gillespie
  We recommend you have a conversation and ask the broker that very valid question. Yeah.

42:39 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Um, I have high expectations of you, but I have full faith that you can live out to those expectations.  That's why I give you hard feedback and really coming from a place of like knowing your potential. So I hope it feels that.

42:53 - Luke Gillespie
  Thanks. I appreciate it. I know.

42:56 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  This is good for you. more that you guys can learn this stuff too. guess what? that creates opportunities for you to take stuff off me and Ryan's plate, right?  And that's that's advancement. So if you get into the head of, how would Ryan or Athena deal with this rather than like me put it back on their plate to handle it?

43:15 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah, exactly.

43:18 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Creates opportunities, right? more you kind of like, me like take this on and figure this out. And you don't have to like send it directly to them, but like you having a stab at the message and being like, hey Athena, was thinking of responding this way.  do you think? Like  awesome. know, and you can do that with Ryan too. So, you know, the more that you're like, it's like, gosh, Luke's doing really great.  Like I should just have him do more client-facing stuff, you know, see, like when you like kind of help, it's helpful to take that kind of like thinking through the next steps off of our plate, because we have to think through like, well, how do I respond and how do I, I'm going to do the cost per write-up, just  so you guys can see how ridiculously expensive a write-up is to this business. And when you see that number, I doubt you're going to let them.  Changed my mind, you know, like, so there's something I realized that S and BASH, was like, I don't know if I even want to see what that number is, but I think it would be useful for all of us because I bet you we're going to train them a lot differently when we see it.

44:30 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah, it's true. It's true. being interested.

44:33 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  How many people, how many man hours it took to get that write-up of, don't you dare bat that back without a very valid, absolute disqualification.  Right, I don't want to deal with Like, no, sir, like, you don't even know how bad it is, you get on that call.

44:51 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah, true, but I mean, I guess that maybe the clients aren't valuing how much one write-up costs if it costs them about $2,500.

45:00 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  for right up in the back of that quickly, but it's because, you know, we we are in service to them, but guiding them and leading them.  So we need to be the leaders, right? Like, yeah. Um, okay, I got to jump off because I've got Stephen Polly.  Anything else urgent that y'all wanted to get through today?

45:23 - Luke Gillespie
  No, I got to jump off to I send you those questions for the window and door company that Anka requested of Negan's in the deal channel.

45:30 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Thank you. Okay, cool.

45:32 - Luke Gillespie
  Um, other than that, I had a few other things.

45:35 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Oh, wait, where are the? Oh, you did the questions on Slack. Okay.

45:40 - Luke Gillespie
  And then what was this list you just sent? Let me make sure I didn't miss anything. In the Zoom channel, that was just my, uh, my agenda.  I wanted to talk about just a few things.

45:49 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Oh, yeah. voicemail. Did you write that up for me?

45:53 - Luke Gillespie
  Oh, yeah, I sent on the script like last week.

45:57 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Oh, okay. Then I just haven't had a chance to see it. Thank you. I'll read you that monthly write up progress.  Anything important there that you wanted to chat with.
  ACTION ITEM: Instruct Gill to send questions re software/IT deal to team first for review before emailing broker. - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/270847222?timestamp=2770.9999

46:12 - Luke Gillespie
  Oh, I was just going to give you an update. Maybe just for our last minute, a gill message back on that deal where the broker's not doing broker calls, gill just said update.  Okay, send me the deal files and he said email me any questions. So gill is encourage him to email all the questions he has and also probably adding a little note of selling himself to the broker about his IT experience and why he'd be a good fit for this software and IT company.

46:41 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, I think it's good to get him to take action but tell him like send the questions here first.  Like even though you're not like physically getting on the call with Athena, we're still all here reviewing and can support and feedback.  So yeah, like if he's feeling uncomfortable or like wants some support in terms of what questions to ask, like send them here.  Do a video or a voice note and we'll all review it and like feedback, you know, in the meantime.

47:05 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah, sounds good. Okay. I'll do that. I gotta jump on this call.

47:09 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Cool. Me too. Great work, guys. I'll see you soon.

47:13 - Luke Gillespie
  Bye. Okay.

47:13 - David R
  Thank you. Bye, bye.
