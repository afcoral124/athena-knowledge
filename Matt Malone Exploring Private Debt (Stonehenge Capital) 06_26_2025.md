# AcquiMatch Buyers Club 06/26/2025

[00:00:00] 

**Athena:** Hello. Hello. Welcome. Welcome. Hey Gil. Hey to see you. I think Polly might be here too. Yeah. Polly over in Atlanta. Gil is out of New York. Might have a few more trickle in as we go through this, but welcome, um, to Buyers Club today. I'm so excited. I've been wanting to bring this conversation to everybody forever.

Um, Matt is somebody that was really meaningful in my journey when I was like originally searching and thought I was gonna go the independent sponsor route. And I found out about this whole world of private debt and SBIC and, and all of this stuff. And I, I went to the independent sponsor conference and was trying manically to try to get appointments 'cause there was some glitch that I couldn't schedule meetings.

And, um, Matt and I ended up connecting afterwards and [00:01:00] he's just been a real amazing breath of fresh air, super supportive, really great at helping me kind of understand the landscape. And so quite a few of you might want to, um, use this. Option on the deals that you're looking at. So I thought, who better to, um, you know, help us kind of understand this and somebody that helped me understand it and has been supportive of me throughout this journey.

So Matt, so excited to have you here and thank you so much for your time. 

**Matt:** Um, I really don't think of private credit as exciting as you make it, but I hope we can make it somewhat as exciting as that. You do a really good job, so appreciate. 

**Athena:** I, I think the headline, right? Like no pg, that's like, that's the thing that gets everybody super excited, but you know, capital has costs, so we're gonna, we're gonna go through that and talk about what are the trade-offs when you're not getting a PG and you're working someone with you.

So I think it's super exciting, but that's the kind of nerd that I am. Like you should have seen how excited I am when I was, when we [00:02:00] launched our new financial modeling template. I'm like, is this not the coolest thing you've ever seen? People are like, 

**Matt:** I do get excited about that kind of stuff. That's for sure.

So 

**Athena:** me too. Awesome. Well, um, if you could, you know, kick us off, maybe tell us a bit about yourself, your background, and just top line, what does Stonehenge do? And then we'll, we'll start to break into the specifics after that. 

**Matt:** Yeah. And I might even start out and say, I'm here to be a resource for all you guys, whether it's with Stonehenge money or not.

Feel free to call on me after this meeting. You can find me just about anywhere. My email's out there, phone, I can give that to you. Um, but I'm here to help, uh, at the end of the day. And if I can, if I can do that, then that's a success. And so just know that I'm pretty informal, I'm pretty easygoing. And here to help the group, uh, whether it's today or six months from now, it's, it's perfectly okay.

So, um, [00:03:00] gosh, I've been with, uh, Stonehenge, uh, capital for 10 years. We've been around for 26 years. Uh, we spun out of Bank one. Uh, some of you guys might remember Bank One. Um, most of the crowd that I talked to never looks at me like I'm cross-eyed 'cause they don't remember Bank one. But, um, spun out of bank 1 26 years ago.

Uh, we've been, uh, making what I'd call growth capital investments, uh, since that time. And how do we define growth capital? Um, it's really. For us, we're investing out of a couple of different buckets. We have an SBIC fund that, uh, Athena, uh, alluded to, SBIC fund. We can demystify that for you guys if you'd like.

Um, pretty easy. Um, that's a, uh, kind of a senior stretch debt investment. So we take senior debt risk and mezzanine debt risk, blend that together and kind of come up with a one stop [00:04:00] shop unitranche, uh, debt investment. So, um, you know, you're only dealing with one lender instead of two, which. Should be, should make things much easier.

So that's one bucket that we invest out of SBIC funds. The next bucket that we invest out of is really specific and probably not pertinent to the group. Um, but we have, um, six or seven or eight state specific funds. Uh, for example, we've been investing, uh, money in Oklahoma, Mississippi, Georgia, Utah, Nevada.

So we have six or seven or eight of those state specific funds. And I can list that out for you guys in, in an email or something if you'd like. If you found a deal in Utah of all places, I'd say please make us the first. Group that you talk to, because we can get really creative, really aggressive in those handful of states.

And those are tax credit driven programs that give us, you know, pretty good [00:05:00] flexibility, same type of investment. It can be really senior debt, junior debt. It can be equity, it can be just about anything. It's really flexible. Um, and I call that growth capital broadly. Um, so think of us for SBIC and then these state specific funds, and, and that's what we've been doing for the better part of 20, 26 years.

Uh, and these are all lower middle market businesses. They're not big companies. We're not chasing elephants. We like companies that cash flow, call it, you know, a million bucks to, to whatever. 

**Athena:** Generally 

**Matt:** it's kind of one to five, one to seven probably. So these are pretty small enterprises. Um, and so, yeah, I don't know.

I think is that. 

**Athena:** That's a great start. Yeah. Thank you so much. So, um, you know, I think a lot of the questions that 'cause most, most people here have capital of their own to invest. They can do the SBA play, [00:06:00] but sometimes it's like, well, what if I need to move fast? Or what if a bank says no altogether? Um, so, you know, like I I was saying earlier, we don't talk about your world ever.

Like I don't really hear it in any of the, you know. Resources that are out there or that sort of thing. So I think it's really exciting because even a lot of folks here are looking at a million plus range. Um, actually we have Polly in Georgia, we have, uh, Andrew in Oklahoma. So we do have folks in some of your areas too, and we'd love to get that list.

And what we can do afterwards is we'll get the list from you and your contact details and we can share that with the replay. Uh, so generously offered the contact details. Um, so, you know, I think this is a whole, you know, brand new area. A brand new area, and you started breaking it down. But how is this different from just going to a bank for.

**Matt:** You know, so I call us, we're, a lot of us are [00:07:00] recovering bankers, as I like to say. We all were credit trained, we were brainwashed. And so, you know, uh, the, the banking conservatism, uh, is something that we're all fairly well used to. And, and I might admit, I mean, we look at things from a pretty conservative, uh, basis, but, um, you know, banks today, we, I do think, um, we were just talking 10 minutes ago about maybe banks coming off the bench and being slightly more involved in these types of transactions.

You know, I, I'd say slightly more. Some are hot, some are cold, and then there might be a couple in the middle. Um, but it does seem like banks might be at least making calls and entertaining deals. But from our perspective, we still see banks as being pretty darn conservative and nodding, not wanting to over-leverage something.

All the while needing personal guarantees and, you know, uh, [00:08:00] the litany of things that, that banks ask for. Um, I would say for what is the difference between us and a bank? Um, you know, we probably, um, would be a little more generous from a, a loan perspective. We generally look at things on a cash flow basis, so we're mo we're loaning money on a multiple of cash flow.

You know, where banks might do somewhere between one and two. I don't think they're doing three times much these days of cashflow. You know, that's something that, that we, we generally look at. Um, and I think probably from a flexibility standpoint, from covenants, we're probably more flexible than a bank.

Um, you know, you're gen generally only dealing with a couple of us here in the office. You don't have to call New York or Charlotte or LA to get something done. And so we like to kind of play that up that it's just for better or worse, you're dealing with mad. And so it's, uh, I like to think that's [00:09:00] better, but uh, you know, uh, I guess Tom would tell.

But, um, so flexibility. Um, just the way we think of things. I think we're a longer term partner than probably a bank. A lot of times we'll write a little equity into a deal, and believe me, uh, when you're both a lender and an equity provider, you look at the company a lot different. Uh, you behave different if there's a, uh, you know, a default, for example.

Um, and so, um, you know, I think that that that helps. Um, align the incentives with folks like y'all. If we're, and we're not. Listen, we're, we're small equity investors. We're not control, we're not wanting to be the operator. That's why we invest in folks like y'all. Um, and so, but you know, I think that's, that's important, uh, from a behavior standpoint for many private.

Debt investors to have some equity and it really changes the behavior, uh, and your thought, at least my thought process when I'm working with the company. So, um, [00:10:00] so yeah, flexibility, maybe a little equity. Um, probably if you're talking about SBA speed and SBA don't, aren't mentioned generally in the same sentence.

I think we move pretty quick. Um, and so, and I think we mentioned, you know, we generally don't get personal guarantees on, on things. I mean, we wanna see meaningful equity contribution from, from investors. Um, but as far as leaning on a personal guarantee, that's just not something we do. We really want to underwrite, um, the cash flow of the business and the certainty or uncertainty of getting repaid with cash flow.

And I think that's what most private debt investors we're not putting advance rates on real estate and equipment and. Uh, inventory and accounts receivable. We kind of do that in the background, but we're not big asset gatherers. And that's a big difference from the bank. You know, the bank has a pretty [00:11:00] formulaic loan equation.

Um, and if it's not in that box, it doesn't work. We're probably a lot more flexible than that. Um, when it, when it comes to loan amount, I don't know. Gosh, I rambled on it. I jumped all over the place. I'm sorry. No, it's, it's 

**Athena:** great. It's, it's great. Uh, context, so please, please ramble. 'cause I, I think this is, this is all new to us.

And hearing inside how you think about these things and how you analyze these things. So, you know, typically, like if we're to compare SBA, we're looking at like, you know, a minimum debt service coverage ratio of like, usually 1.5 is the comfort range. Um, is, is that how you all are looking at it? Do you have a, you know, debt service coverage ratio that you wanna see?

You said two turns, three turns, like where, where. Comparably. I guess if, if somebody wants to come to someone like you, if it would work for SBA, would it work for you or are there things that would normally disqualify it? 

**Matt:** So, uh, so a couple of different things. Um, so there's, um, what I'd call a leverage ratio, [00:12:00] which I was referring to the two or three 

**Athena:** mm-hmm.

**Matt:** Four times number. And then there's the debt service coverage fixed charge, you know, of. I mean, we're kind of one and a quarter. Okay. One, three times kind of folks. Um, and I think with us, um, the other thing that is maybe a little more flexible is, you know, if it's not quite that high at closing, maybe we can ramp that up over time.

Uh, the, the covenant that is, um. Maybe we can provide some interest only in the beginning to allow some time to, you know, to grow into the capital, to get your feet wet, whatever it might be. So flexibility from a structure and covenant perspective is something that I think investors like us are pretty comfortable with doing.

And like you said, maybe the SBA has a very hard and fast box of, oh, it's gotta be this on day one. And that's generally not us. I think we look at it more broadly than just [00:13:00] some hard and fast covenant levels. Um, yeah. Did, did I answer that? 

**Athena:** Yep, 

**Matt:** that was 

**Athena:** great. Um, so, you know, a lot of people are buying businesses to have ownership.

Autonomy control that they aren't getting in their W twos. So there are some people that are gun shy around bringing in an equity investor. How do you all look at equity? Are you expecting an exit in a certain amount of time? You mentioned earlier you don't necessarily get involved in the day-to-day that much.

Like, you know, for someone that's like, I wanna be an owner of a business and be able to make decisions in a business. How would that work with someone like yourselves 

**Matt:** there? Okay. There's a lot to unpack there and I'll try to answer all of that. Um, so most every deal we're looking at today, it involves a deal just with folks just like you guys.

Uh, I mean, um, I'd say we have [00:14:00] 55 to 60 portfolio companies. I bet the vast majority of those. We're around some kind of m and a transaction and not with a private equity group involved. It's generally, uh, a, a mid-career executive that's wanting exactly what you mentioned. Um, and so, uh, so I think all that makes a lot of sense.

We're used to that. You mentioned equity. You know, we always kind of think of equity contribution as what's meaningful, what's meaningful to Justin is probably different than Guild and Matt and Polly and we're all different. Yeah. But I think what we look at is what's, what's meaningful here? And we try, we don't have a hard and fast, you know, 20% or 30% or whatever it is.

Uh, we really look at it and, and try to determine what's meaningful contribution from, uh, the, the CEO, the owner. Um. [00:15:00] We do like to put in a little bit on our, you know, ourselves. Um, and I think every private debt, private equity investor is different. We're sure not a fit for everybody because we are, as you alluded to, probably a little hands off.

I mean, we're not making day-to-day, week to week, even month to month decisions. I mean, again, that's kind of what we, we wanna hire you guys. But what we can do is we can bring our resources, our CEOs, our contacts, uh, to the table and help in a lot of different ways. But we're sure not we'll sit on the board.

Yes, we might have an observer seat. We might have an active seat, but yeah, we're not making the day-to-day decisions. You know, I will say we were just on the phone with one of our, um, uh, CEOs and she was. We were walking through her, her bonus and her top management team [00:16:00] bonus, uh, pool, and the way we're gonna measure that, easy conversations to have, we have a lot of data points on that we can help, you know, around that.

Um, but yeah, if it's day to day, that's probably not Stonehenge. And it might be other private debt, private equity firms, they probably like to do that. But we kind of look at it as, hey, we're trying to pick the right horses here and, and wager on those and kind of get outta the way and let you guys run the business.

And if there's some guardrails, if there's some help that you guys need, then we're all in call on us anytime. Again, we're talking monthly when we get financials and the board package and that kind of thing. But, um, you know, everybody's different and that's, that's a really pretty important. And I don't know how you get to that unless you work with them, but it's, it's important.

I'd, I'd sure try to dig in and just understand the [00:17:00] involvement, uh, of folks. And, and some people might like more handholding and some might like less, but I don't know. Does that help? 

**Athena:** It does help, yes. And I think that's good to, you know, this is how you all look at it, but there's a whole world of, of, you know.

Yeah. It's like, I don't wanna call you an institution, but fund. How would you, like, if we were to use a word to describe. 

**Matt:** Yeah. Um, this world definitely we have, uh, capital provider, private capital providers. I would say we're kind of, you know, 80% private debt, 20% private equity probably. Right? 

**Athena:** Yeah. Okay, great.

Yeah. Cool. So, okay, you used some words earlier and I'd love to break some of those down. Like, when I first started hearing them, I was like, what, what, what? So, okay. First of all, an S-B-I-C-I think a lot of people hear, myself included at the beginning, love a plain English explanation of what that means.

So like, what, what makes that different? What even is it? [00:18:00] 

**Matt:** Yeah, so an SBIC fund is a fund, uh, that is governed by the SBA. Um, and um, we, our investors in that SBIC fund are banks. Banks get, uh, CRA credit for investing in our fund. And CRA is Community Reinvestment Act. Uh, a lot of banks are looking, you know, to deploy capital in CRA areas when they invest in an SBIC like us, they actually get credit for our calling efforts in these, you know, roundabout places.

And so I'm not sure exactly how that works, but just take my word for it, that they get credit, you know, from our effort. And so banks are really motivated to invest in sbs like us. And so what does it mean from a, you know, practicality standpoint for from you guys? Our money's green, just like any other fund.

You don't have to deal with the banks. They [00:19:00] don't approve our deals. They are simply writing checks when we call the capital to invest in in your businesses. Um, and so yeah, it's a, it's a really nice way the SBA actually provides leverage on the commitments from the bank and it's really cheap leverage.

Um, and so it's a fantastic vehicle for the government and the banks to get money into lower middle market businesses that might be overlooked from the, the big investors. 

**Athena:** Yeah. Okay. That was gonna be kind of a. Question was like, why would the SBA do something like, so yeah. You know, it's give money to the banks.

The banks give their money to you, you then invest, like yeah, make that sense. It's really, 

**Matt:** it's really the CRA credit. We're obviously paying them a preferred return. Um, 

**Athena:** yeah. 

**Matt:** And, uh, it, and it's, it's not an easy process. We're going through it now in fund two and I mean, [00:20:00] banks really get under the covers and really wanna know kind of how you've done.

And so it's not easy, it's not an easy process. The SBA is tight on this as well, but, uh, I think the program's been around for probably more than 30 years probably. And. Uh, there have been a lot of new SBAS bics that have come on, but that's something I I would encourage you guys to, to look at. Uh, there's, it's all pretty public information.

You, you can find SBIs where you are. Um, and we all do something a little different. Um, not everybody would write an equity check. Some are just debt focused. Some would write bigger equity checks. I mean, it's, everybody's a little different. Uh, and so, um, I would just encourage you guys to explore that and, and again, happy to help.

Um, we know a bunch of them. Uh, yeah. Ha, happy to, happy to help you think through any of that if I [00:21:00] need to. 

**Athena:** So, is the SB say, I, I think you, you said this, but the SBA is, is supporting this kind of activity to get money into businesses that otherwise might not get it. Is this, is this maybe the gap between like the seven A program and larger investments or, 

**Matt:** you know, probably it's a good question.

I don't think so because I think the s from what I've been reading on the SBA and, and, you know, we've competed against the SBA on deals, uh, especially as rates, uh, ticked up, you know, the difference in our rate and an SBA rate was negligible, and then we're talking about a PG difference, right? Mm-hmm. 

**Athena:** And so 

**Matt:** we were able to probably do a lot of those deals.

Let's just face it, when, uh, the Fed starts cutting rates and banks, you know, their rate looks a little better, the SBA rate gets cheaper, it'll, it will be tougher for folks [00:22:00] like us who still have a fairly fixed cost of capital, right? Um, so we're trying to make a while we can today. Um, but um. The, I think the seven A program is going to, I don't know if they're gonna double that to where they can do $10 million loan.

Uh, I mean, that's a big number, uh, least in our world. That's a, that's a nice big number. Um, so I suspect that, yeah, the SBA will, uh, continue to be a competitor for us. Um, 

**Athena:** well, this, this, 

**Matt:** go ahead. 

**Athena:** No, I was interrupting your thought. It's, I, I'm curious how much you're following along on the, the SOP changes, but they just dropped, you know, this massive SOP change, it's changing.

The, you, you can no longer use seller equity. Yeah. To be able to make up the equity injection, which is clipping a lot of people's buying power and they're introdu reintroducing the, [00:23:00] um, you know, if an owner is a license holder or if if the owner is license holder and then you need a license in the business you wanna keep the owner in, they're still requiring them to be an equity holder, but then having to like pg the whole loan.

So it's, it's making deals a lot harder for individuals to get it done. 

**Matt:** Yeah, and I think you're right. I, I got brain damage when I hear. Whatever all that was. Um, and I knew I knew enough or read enough just to kind of know, okay, that does sound like it's gonna be tough from the SBA, why are they doing that?

Um, and so yeah, that probably creates opportunity for us 'cause we're just kinda steady ed. I mean, we haven't really changed how we think about that. Um, and so yeah, you're, you're probably right. Um, that is, it's tougher today than it was last month to get an SBA deal done, especially a, you know, an acquisition deal.

For sure. 

**Athena:** So on that [00:24:00] note then, how do your terms, you know, you said your, your terms are pretty, the, the differences are pretty negligible. And I know you can't give it an exact because you, you analyze every deal. But are you able to give just kind of like an idea of a range of, what kind of terms might somebody be looking at if they were to 

**Matt:** Yeah, yeah, absolutely.

So we generally like to, um. Amortize, I'll just start there. We'll amortize half the debt over five years. That's an effective 10 year amortization. Similar to the SBA, I think we kind of backed into that. Um, I always get asked the question, well, okay, if we're amortizing half of it in five years, what happens at in the fifth?

You know, at the maturity, you know, generally we'll either be taken out by a bank or cheaper capital, or we'll just extend it and keep rocking along. Um, or maybe there's another acquisition in the mix and we'd love to stay in the deal and do it all over again. Mm-hmm. Um, but so yeah, call it a 10 year effective amortization.

Our [00:25:00] rates, uh, today are anywhere from probably, you know, high, high single digits to low, very low double digits, depending on if we're senior, if we're subordinate the risk profile, you know, it's a, it's a bad answer, but I'm not it kidding you guys. I mean, we, it's a, it's a risk. Profile, kind of look at it.

But yeah, high, high, single digits, low, very low double digits. A lot of times we can, uh, accrue part of the interest rate. What does that mean? Uh, we might have a, you know, call it an eight cash pay interest rate in a 2% pick, payable and kind. So you're really only paying the cash rate, uh, of 8% on a month to month basis.

And you're accruing the two just to, you know, maybe soften the, soften the interest rate cost for a company or help the cash flow a little bit. So there's ways to do the interest rate [00:26:00] to make it more palatable for folks. I don't think a bank does that. Um, uh, let's see, uh, amortization interest rate. Um, we generally have two covenants I've mentioned.

I. Fixed charge coverage or debt service coverage, whichever one and a, uh, cash flow leverage. That's, that's generally the two that we have. Um, uh, 

**Athena:** can you explain those two things for what, what, what you're looking at there or what you're looking for? Yeah. 

**Matt:** Really, really, one, the debt service coverage is really can the company cover its p and i debt service, whether it's to us a seller note, uh, whatever else might be included in that.

We're really just trying to determine if, if, uh, and the, the buffer that it has in covering its fixed charges or its debt service. Um, the other one, cashflow leverage. You know, a lot of banks will look at it from a balance sheet, leverage perspective. That's really not us. We're more [00:27:00] cashflow oriented, so we would just take, you know, debt to cashflow and have a covenant based on that.

Uh, great. Yeah. 

**Athena:** Um, so you. When you offer debt, sometimes you also include some, uh, like e like ownership equity for yourselves. Are you looking for somebody to like sell the business in a certain amount of time or like what? Yeah, I'm glad you mentioned equity. 

**Matt:** I didn't answer that. I'm glad you brought that back up.

And, and one other thing, um, people ask about fees. We're somewhere we have a closing fee of one to 2% generally on our deals. There's no ongoing maintenance fee. There's not a lot of other, there's no other hidden fees that we have that maybe an SBA might have a few more fees than that, but, um, um, gosh, I just completely forgot what your question was.

Uh, 

**Athena:** uh, if you take equity in, in [00:28:00] someone's, uh, if you take ownership in someone's company, are you expecting an exit in a certain amount of years? How is that equity treated? 

**Matt:** Yeah, so. Again, every private debt, private equity firm is different. Stonehenge, um, because we have pretty good flexibility in those state funds and our SBIC fund, we really don't have the mandate of, Hey, you're in and out in five years, come hell or high water.

You know, a lot of firms are like that and that's great, but we have probably a little more flexibility. We've been in a couple of companies. I wish I could tell you directly. Um, we've been around 26 years. I know we've been in a couple for 20 years. Wow. We probably didn't underwrite it that way in the beginning.

Um, but here we are. And so, you know, what I, what I try to say is, Hey, we're, we're pretty patient, pretty flexible. And you know what, if a deal's working, we wanna stay in. It's so much easier to do a deal, another deal with somebody we know, [00:29:00] somebody we've worked with. Keep pumping money into, into a good situation.

I'll give you an example on that. Two examples. Um, two of our latest acquisitions, uh, one was done, uh, I think probably November of last year. They came to us and said, Hey, we have an add-on. This was January, I think, and we ended up doing that add-on after two months of kind of relationship performance pretty quick, right?

I mean, that, that generally doesn't happen. Um, and it's, it's been great a deal. I'm trying to close Monday, a company of mine we closed, um, in, um, gosh, I think we've got, uh, we've had two, yeah, two financials. So a couple of months. Uh, they found an add-on that seems to be really a, a, a good deal. We obviously wanna stay in, so we're gonna fund that for them.

Um, and so. [00:30:00] I think it's a point of, if it's working, we have money. We want to put it in good situations, and we really don't want to get paid off. I mean, it, it's, the objective is to have good assets, good earning assets with good people. And so yeah, we really, um, yeah, uh, not, not in any huge hurry to get money back these days for sure.

**Athena:** Great. Love that. So, okay. Um, you also mentioned some of these like impact funds, these state led funds. So can you tell us a little bit more about those? And for the folks here that are in some of those states, like Yeah, are there different considerations that we've talked about? You're saying, you know, for the, the overall stuff, you're looking at a million in EBITDA north of that, but I, I believe there's different considerations based on the state.

**Matt:** Yeah, there really are. Every state is different and it gets murky and I'm not gonna take the rest of the afternoon and bore anybody with, with the details of them. But just know that we [00:31:00] can, yeah, we can write really any kind of check into those senior debt, junior debt or equity. Um, the size really varies.

It can be probably even less than a million and it can be up to seven in some states. Um, I mentioned the tax credit angle and I'm not gonna bore you on how that works, but, um. For example, uh, the state of Oklahoma passed a bill, um, two years ago and said, we want to bring capital to rural Oklahoma and to our state because we're, you know, it's a flyover state, whatever you want to call it.

Um, and so it was a bill that was passed. You can go out and research it, it's all public. Um, and so we participated in that, raised the capital for it, and we ended up having a, uh, $20 million fund to invest in Oklahoma specific businesses. The state said, Hey, we want you to invest, [00:32:00] uh, 30% in Tulsa or Oklahoma City and 70% everywhere else.

So all these are job creation, job retention, uh, rural. They all have some kind of quirky aspect to it. And leave it to us. We'll determine if it qualifies or not. I'm not, again, not gonna bore you with those. Gory details, but every state is a little different. Um, and, uh, but it's, it's really flexible money.

Um, we get pretty aggressive when we see opportunities in rural Connecticut or rural Oklahoma, or nowhere, Utah. I mean, we get kind of crazy about those things. And so, um, yeah, that's, that's a little bit about those, those funds. 

**Athena:** Awesome. Great. Yeah, we'll get that list from you for sure. Yeah. So if somebody's considering a deal in that area and, and even not in those areas.

Um, how do you feel about folks getting in [00:33:00] touch with you to discuss the deal pre LOI or do you prefer for them to be post LOI or does it depend on the area or no? I, 

**Matt:** I would say the ear. Yeah, it's a great question. The earlier, the better. Uh, and again, we're here to be a resource and if we can kind of tell you how we might think of a structure on a deal, maybe that helps you, you can then negotiate with the seller on a seller note or whatever it might be.

Um, happy to look early on, um, and give some guidance that way. Um, obviously it'd be great if it was fully baked and there were terms agreed to, and a data room and all that. Eh, it kind of happens some of the times with us. So we're, again, we're here to be a resource, um, and love talking deals and love kind of talking through structures and at least how we might think about it.

Um, and so happy to do that really anytime. 

**Athena:** Amazing. Uh, I, I hope you know what you just offered there, but we'll keep it within the walls of our, it's [00:34:00] perfectly good base. I mean, 

**Matt:** I, I just had a guy text me and say, Hey, does Louisiana qualify? And I said, well, send me the address. And he sent it to me. I put it in our mapping software, and sure enough, you know, Shreveport qualifies.

I mean, that's so easy. That's easy for us to do to even, I mean, anyway, 

**Athena:** yeah. Happy 

**Matt:** to chat anytime, as early as, as we need to. Yeah. 

**Athena:** Great. So what's the, what's the, like minimum that you would consider in, in one of those areas? Like what, when you say, you said 1 million to seven, is that check size or ebitda or like.

**Matt:** Yeah, good. A good question. 'cause I, I go through this too fast, but, um, in the state funds, I'd say probably a minimum, uh, check size of a million dollars probably. So that means, you know, cashflow could be less than that. Right. Um, and our SBIC fund, you know, we really, to move the needle there, we [00:35:00] probably need to be writing checks with a minimum of four or $5 million probably to move the needle in that fund.

We can go up to north of 20. Um, I'm not sure we've written a $20 million check so far. We probably average somewhere between, you know, five and 10 probably in that fund. Um. And so, you know, that's a company that's probably doing, um, a, a, a few mi, couple few million bucks of cash flow probably for, for the SBIC.

But yeah, on the, on the state funds, if I didn't say it, we can be, we can go pretty low, we can be pretty creative on, on how we do that. 

**Athena:** Fantastic. So, um, switching tax a little bit, most of the folks who are first time buyers, so what are the top two or three things you look for in someone before you'd be willing to entertain lending them money?

What's, it's a good question. Stand out. 

**Matt:** Yeah. We are all about [00:36:00] people and you know, we turned down plenty of really nice deals, but for whatever reason, maybe a background check came back or we just. It's all about the people, because when things go wrong or things don't work out exactly right. If you're working with good people, good things will generally happen.

And we've, we've had experience the other way and we try to avoid that. And so, you know, really, um, even before financials, it's a, it's a people driven business for us. And, you know, we're a small office, but we all try to get to know our deals, try to get to know our people. Um, and so, um, I'd say that's a number one on a deal.

Um, even before, you know, industry or stability of revenue, whatever it is. I mean, it's really a people for us, it's a people driven business [00:37:00] and it that just, it can either make or break a deal every day. 

**Athena:** So are you looking for industry experience? A big resume, certain aptitudes? Are you giving people personality tests like work?

No. No. How, how do you figure out if they're a good person? 

**Matt:** You know, I mean, when you work with someone kind of day to day for six months trying to get a deal done, you kind of figure out, uh, you know, and, and how that person reacts to adversity. 'cause, you know, deals rarely go smoothly. Um, I mean, we get background checks on, on everyone.

Um, uh, you know, someone, you know, fresh out of college, undergrad, not a lot of experience. Right. That's really tough for us. Mid-career executives. Now we're talking. And so, uh, you know, [00:38:00] someone that has run a p and l or managed people or had to make payroll or those things, those things help. They're not an end all be all, but, uh, you know, if some, if we can look at a resume and go, golly, I mean, this person has yeah, run a, a a p and L for a larger organization.

They've managed people. They've probably worked through some pretty tough situations. Gosh, those are, those are great. And I can't say we find that all the time, but I mean, that's, those are great things to, to lean on. 

**Athena:** Love it. And do you want someone to have direct, exact industry experience of the business that they're acquiring?

**Matt:** No. We see that plenty of time. Uh, that, um, that there's a, a mismatch there. Uh, I can point to a lot of different examples. Um. Uh, folks that didn't have any experience, uh, in that specific industry. If they do, that's great, but [00:39:00] that's not, again, it's not a end all be all for us. 

**Athena:** Great. And when people show up to discuss a deal with you, what do you like to see?

How do you like that presented? 

**Matt:** Oh, gosh. So yeah, it can be as something as as easy as a conversation, uh, in the beginning. Um, you know, I would probably quickly move to getting the financial package. Um, you know, if there's a sim from the, the representing banker, that's great. Sometimes we don't even have that.

Um, but uh, you know, yeah, I'd say definitely a financial package resume. Um, and, you know, that, that gets us pretty far down the road as far as knowing how much we could maybe leverage this business and equity contribution we're looking at and the stability of. The, the performance and that kind of thing.

Um, and so we're not looking for a full blown data room before we even have a [00:40:00] conversation. That's not us. We're used to businesses that may not even have a controller, as crazy as that sounds. Um, so we're, we're kind used to piecing a lot of things together. Um, obviously it'd be great if we didn't have to do that, but we, we do that.

And so, yeah. Um, pretty flexible on that front. 

**Athena:** Amazing. So, um, you mentioned a word that I don't think we hear kicked around in, in like SBA land. You said covenant. So can you explain what that means and, and how someone might think about, you know, the different term? Like, we all know SBA and what we're gonna expect with a bank and how the governance looks and that sort of thing.

Yeah. Like how might that be different and you know, what's a covenant? 

**Matt:** Yeah. So when I mentioned covenants, I really mentioned, or really think of it from those two, the fixed charge or debt service coverage and the leverage. And I'll give you an [00:41:00] example. We were just on the phone. Uh, we, uh, young woman bought this business.

We blew the first three quarters of covenants. I mean the very first one and the second one and the third one right outta the gate. And so we were talking to her, we were re, you know, revamping the budget, uh, looking at that and then really trying to set meaningful covenants going forward. And so, uh, there, it's more art than science, I must admit, at least for us, when it comes to that.

So with her, we're gonna set it, uh, you know, I hate to even tell you the le level we're gonna set it at, but it's gonna be pretty high. And then we try to work it down based on the budget. Um, we look at covenants as more of a, a guardrail, um, or a fence around a deal. And so if the deal happens to, you know, get beyond that, it's a [00:42:00] conversation starter.

We're not calling the note. We're not calling any, I mean, that's not what we do. We're not in business to do that. We're in business to have smart conversations, figure out what happened, adjust. Then go from there. And so that's our approach on covenants. I wish I could say that's probably everybody's approach to covenants, but it's not.

Um, but that's how we think about it. It's a guardrail, it, it's a discussion. It brings us all back to the table to have a discussion on what happened, where we, where we are today and where are we going and, and how do we make it right. And so that's how we, that's our philosophy on covenants and I think it serves us pretty well.

Um, got 

**Athena:** it. So if I were to put that in simpler terms, yeah. I buy a business, we partner on the capital together. We agree. Like a debt service coverage ratio of 1.3. But when you say blew it, she went below that, I [00:43:00] imagine the first three quarters. So now we're working together to figure out, okay, how do we get back on track to what we thought this was gonna be so that we're not putting the whole thing at risk?

Did I. Play that back to you appropriately. 

**Matt:** Absolutely. And she actually busted our leverage covenant. She was fine on debt service coverage, perfectly fine. Um, but from a leverage perspective, she was outta whack. And so, and in this deal we have more equity than debt. So I'm not just a lender. If I was a lender only, I might be a little more touchy about the situation, but you know, we're a pretty decent equity investor in this, so guess what?

We're a little more flexible, uh, around things. And so, um, I think you said it right. Um, again, just they're guard posts, guardrails, and it just, it brings us back to have a conversation. Um, and, and where do we go from here? Yeah. 

**Athena:** So some of the benefits of, [00:44:00] you know, beyond just the, the metrics, right? And the pg something that you talked about, your resources.

You know, we had a woman on who bought a business, used SBA, did a QV, did everything right, got into the business, realized there was fraud, and the owner was competing from day one. They didn't necessarily speak to their lender to be able to use their resources to help with that. But I imagine, and maybe I'm speaking outta turn, but like something like that, that happens with one of your investments, you would also be able to rally and, and help and support on how to navigate that.

**Matt:** Yeah, for sure. We, um, you know, I, I'd be lying if over 26 years we didn't have anything, any, any deal where we were defrauded. Uh, we have, uh, um, I. Business here in Dallas. Um, we supported, uh, a sponsor buying this business. There was fraud. It was [00:45:00] more of a, man, I'm not even gonna mention the, the company name or the industry, but, um, yeah, we hung in there.

Uh, we supported him with legal resources. Long story short, I think it's all, it's all kind of worked out. Um, we ended up selling that business to somebody else, kind of working through all that. But it happens. If somebody wants to defraud you, they're gonna find a way to do it. And it's, it's awful. And yeah, it's, yeah.

Um, but you're right. I mean, we provided a lot of resources on that a lot of time. Uh, and in the end it kind of all worked out. Um, thankfully, but it, it happens. Um, but yeah, that's the ki it's a good example. I mean, that's the kind of thing where we can Yeah. Kind of bring maybe a little more. I don't know, wait to the situation and, and really lean on somebody to get some stuff done, maybe.

Yeah. 

**Athena:** Well, yeah. I mean, the way she was describing it is like they're in a legal battle and she's [00:46:00] like, they have the millions that we just paid them and we have the, like scraps that are left in the bank account because they misrepresented us. Yeah. You know, and they didn't, they didn't know that they could lean on the lender, you know, in, in this case if it was you to, to, to come and help.

So I think, you know, while most of us are over the W2 being told what to do, taking orders from somebody else, in a situation like this, you actually have a, somebody that's invested in you doing well and coming out of this. Okay. 

**Matt:** Yeah. Yeah. And, um, you know, in that situation, I think we were lucky enough to have kind of a, a holdback, um, or an escrow that that helped.

Um. Don't see that in every deal. I don't know why we had it in that deal, but we did. Uh, maybe it was the industry of the, the business that we did that, but um, yeah, those are, those are the kinds of things we can help with. Even maybe from a, [00:47:00] even before you get to that point of having a non-comp a, a pretty good non-compete from the seller, some things we can do there legally to maybe tie, you know, keep them from doing some of this.

I mean, again, if they want to defraud you, they'll get you. Yeah. But maybe there's some things legally and documentation that we can do to mitigate that somewhat. Yeah. 

**Athena:** So, um, when. You, you mentioned monthly. So is is that like, you know, your, your investments are kind of providing you financial statements monthly, so you can just check what's going on, but you're not necessarily like having a deep conversation every month if everything's okay?

**Matt:** It's a good question. Um, so our general cadence on financials is monthly or quarterly. Um, probably half and half. I don't know why we do some, some way and some the [00:48:00] other. Um, generally a quarterly board meeting, uh, would be great. Um, and, um, you know, we're always kind of checking in. Um. It's funny, I mean, there's a, a company that, yeah, we probably haven't talked to them in six months.

It's going just fine. They keep paying us a little faster than we want them to, and it's like, I think we, we actually talked to them to say, Hey, can you slow down a little bit? Uh, but, you know, uh, good for them. They're, it's, it's a good situation. Um, so yeah, our, our cadence is kind of probably quarterly more than anything.

Um, you know, we, we like to have board meetings. We like to get together, at least do, we don't travel to every board meeting. We'll do zoom half the time and maybe half the time we're in person, um, want to keep expenses low and, and that kind of thing. So, um, uh, but yeah, kind of a quarterly cadence generally.

**Athena:** Very cool. So, [00:49:00] um, do you have specific, uh, industries that you invest in? Are there industries you won't invest in? Are you kind of open? How do you, and I know every, every fund is gonna be different, every, every person, but y'all specifically, how do you treat Yeah, industries 

**Matt:** generally we don't invest in retail, um, like restaurants.

But then again, we've invested in real in restaurants. We generally don't invest in real estate. Um, but guess what? The deal, Monday, we're getting some real estate. Um, so I, I don't really know what my answer to that is. These days I used to have, those were my two defaults, but now we've kind of blown past those.

Uh, I mean, we'll look at oil and gas. Generally it's oil and gas services. It's not, we're not, uh, drilling. We're not, I. Any of that. It's more of an ancillary service to the industry. Uh, we're here in Texas, so that's probably part [00:50:00] of the equation, and it has been over 26 years. Um, but, uh, yeah, I, I really can't, I mean, we've done healthcare, we've done technology.

We like boring businesses, manufacturing, distribution. Um, I do think that, um, you know, our companies need to be domestic companies. Uh, the SBA does not like when we have a lot of employees, say, in Mexico, for example. Mm-hmm. I've had to pass on a couple of deals that had maquila door operations in Mexico.

You know, we need the vast majority of the company, the employees in, in the us. Um, I just throw that out there. It's a quirky deal for the SBA, but it is what it is. Uh, so 

**Athena:** does that include like, offshoring folks that are utilizing like offshore talent? 

**Matt:** Well, no, I think we're talking really about kind of W2 employees.

Um, [00:51:00] and so it gets a little murky. Um, but we would need to show that a majority of their employees are domestic. Uh, and there might be a couple of ways to define that, but, yeah. 

**Athena:** Interesting. So, um, Justin's been looking at this deal that's kind of a head turner 'cause it's not, it doesn't qualify for SBA 'cause it's a office releaser.

Am I saying that right Justin? 

**Justin:** Yeah. It, it, it's basically a coworking space. Sure. You know, a a a small version of like a WeWork, but yeah. They've got a couple locations, they've got long term, uh, commercial, um, leases in place with, you know, the, the property management for these commercial locations. Um, not incredibly asset intensive because they don't really need to be, other than some furniture fixtures, some snacks, and, you know, things like that.

And really great internet service. Um, and, uh, but it's just not an industry [00:52:00] that SBA is at all interested in. Um, and it's been rejected by multiple attempts for, for buyers. Um, cashflow looks good, otherwise it seems to be a healthy business. There's growth potential. I mean, all, a lot of good markers that back it, but just not an SBA contender.

And so we've been, this is a, a challenging one because it's, it's also at a price and an e. In that weird middle ground, there's not, you know, it's not big enough to really catch the eye of, of a fund or something to really make it worthwhile, but it's also too big for to go to Grant or my end anyway and say, Hey, can you help me with this business?

So it's, we're in this weird predicament situation with this one. 

**Matt:** Yeah. And I, I'll, the cash flow profile of that would be something that we would probably be interested in. Um, you know, we're used to asset light businesses. Um, and so yeah, you know, we would want to dig through those contracts and just look and see, you know, what's the, you know, [00:53:00] what does that look like?

But, um, yeah, and, and Justin happy to talk offline about, you know, if I can think of other, whether it's Stonehenge or somebody else that might take a look at that, I'd be happy to, to think through that with you. Um, that'd 

**Justin:** be fantastic. I. As soon as Athe mentioned that we were getting to meet you, I said, this sounds like definitely something I'd love to run by Matt, because I think you have some perspective that would be unique to this situation.

**Matt:** We, we operate in that, you know, I don't wanna call it no man's land, um, but we're, we're tweeners, right? We're between past and the hat or the family and friend, you know, family and friends raised or the country club raised, and we're sure not chasing the big, the big deals. And so we're kind of in this, you know, intermediate area and that's where we love to play.

I mean, we can, you know, help folks like y'all, we can be a little more impactful. Um, there's probably a little bit less competition from a financing standpoint and that kind of thing. [00:54:00] And so yeah, this, that's kind of what we like to do. So, yeah. Ha, happy to, to think through that, uh, with you a little bit more if you, if you want to.

**Athena:** That'd be awesome. It's a, it's a solid, that's the thing. We found it, we're like, this is awesome. Essentially like, you know, uh, property management for office space, like we work like, but the guy's, uh, numbers are going up, you know, and he is running it well. So it's, it's super interesting. But SBA is just a, a non-starter.

Yeah. So, um, awesome. So yeah, so basically I guess the, the industry thing, you're kind of open mm-hmm. To hearing just about everything. Yeah. Um, you know, and really looking at the, the person that's bringing it to you as much as you're looking at the, the deal itself. Yeah. Um, so are there situations when someone should not use private debt or an SBIC?

Like, is, is there situations where it's a bad idea? [00:55:00] 

**Matt:** No, I mean. In all honesty, everybody knows this, but I mean, a bank's always gonna be the cheapest source of capital. Mm-hmm. It, it, it may not be the most flexible, but it'll be the cheapest. And so, um, you know, there, there are a handful of deals out there that probably fit a bank just perfect.

Maybe there's tons of assets and good cash flow coverage and a pg, you know, all that. I get it. Maybe a bank's the best way to go there. I, I get that. Um, but so many deals today are, are in this no man's land. And it takes a little thinking and a little discussion to try to structure something that, that makes sense.

And so, um, you know, I, I mean I've referred things to the SBA I've ref, I just referred a guy to the SBAI think he'll get his deal done. Um, you know, it wasn't quite a fit for us. Um, I don't exactly remember why, but you know. We're here to help. I, I'm realistic. I know [00:56:00] our money doesn't fit everybody. Um, and there are times that a bank's a good fit.

The SBA a's a good fit, private debt's a good fit. Um, and so, um, that's, that's the only way we know to operate is just to, hey, we're here to be helpful. If it's with us, great. If it's not it, it's okay. Um, because we don't fit everybody. But, um, you know, I think today, uh, the SBA yeah, it probably is getting tougher there, is that the PG across the board.

Um, and that rate's not a ton cheaper than us, if it is. And so, you know, I think we compete with the SBA really well today. Um, even if they did go to $10 million, I think we'd still really try to knock the socks off of 'em. But, um, and then SBI Cs. There are a lot of SBS out there. Again, there's a list out there.

You can, you [00:57:00] can find out where they are, who they are. They've got great websites, and they tell you how great they are, uh, and all the deals they've done. Um, and I, I think it, it makes a lot of sense. The, I think the SBA, you know, developing that program was really smart. Um, and, uh, those are a lot of really smart folks that are running these, these funds.

Uh, and I think those are, those are good options for folks. Um, you just have to find, you know, the ones that wanna do kind of the lower middle market and aren't chasing these humongous deals generally. But, um, yeah, I don't, I didn't directly answer you, but I don't know. Sorry, I'm kind of rambling now. No, no, no.

It's, it's, 

**Athena:** it's good. Um, I, it's something that stood out to me when I went to the independent sponsor conference a couple years ago, was. Everybody was like saying Go for, you know? 'cause I just went after an $8 million deal and raised 3 million and that was like the biggest, you know, thing that I'd come across at [00:58:00] that point.

And everybody's like, go bigger. And I was like, what? Like, yeah. But it there, the one guy explained it to me, he is like, look, I have like, I don't know, I, I could be misremembering, but like a billion dollars to deploy. So me writing $8 million checks is like, it's too hard for me to do. So there's a lot of these folks that are like, they need to write bigger checks because to do the underwriting and the whole process of trying to write a check, doing it too small doesn't make sense.

So that's why it was so cool to find yourselves because it seems like you do play nicely in the, the larger side of things. And when, when the risk from. You know, a personal perspective when you're looking at larger deals that you're capable of doing yourself, but then there's a PG attached to it on top of that, and you've got a family and everything to look after, it's like, that's a big conversation to have with yourself.

**Matt:** Yeah, it is. It really is. Um, yeah, I, I guess we've kinda stayed true to ourself and, and we will write those smaller checks, uh, and it takes as [00:59:00] much effort to write a $5 million check as a $20 million check. It just does. But we, you know, that's, that's what we do. Uh, we're, we're trying to invest in lower middle market companies that, you know, are probably overlooked and by the, by the bigger guys.

Um, so yeah. 

**Athena:** So I I, I, I have two questions, but, uh, the first is, um, I actually have a ton of questions, but folks, if, if you have any questions yourself, I think, you know. Matt's, uh, a an amazing resource and, and open, there's no questions off the table. So even if you have specific deals that you've looked at or are looking at and wanna talk about with him too, please start, raise in your hands, but I'll, I'll hog the mic in the meantime.

Um, what, what do you see are like common traps or mistakes that buyers do, either when working with yourselves or just in general? Like what are things that you're seeing maybe like people doing their first deal that they, they're getting wrong or getting [01:00:00] trapped by? 

**Matt:** You know, it's a, God, that's a really good question.

Um,

you know, probably, oh boy. Um, under capitalizing a deal, um, whether it's from an equity perspective or just having enough cash on the balance sheet, you know, we're big fans of having more than enough cash on the balance sheet After closing. You know, we've seen it matter of fact recently where we, you know, the attorneys end up being a little bit more and this cost a little bit more, and by the time the cash is left on the balance sheet, it's like, you know, whoa, we were projecting having a half million bucks and now we've got $175,000 or whatever it is.

And so that's stressful not only for us, but for the operator. Um, so I would just pay it, really pay close attention and, and just having more cash than you [01:01:00] think you need on the balance sheet at closing. And then, yeah, just under capitalizing something I think that can, that can derail a deal just, you know, immediately, um, if you have an, a willing investor who's gonna do some debt, maybe they're gonna ride a little equity and it's, you know, to me, I.

It's easier for me to say on this side of the table 'cause I've never sat on your side. But, you know, arguing over basis points and that kind of thing just doesn't really move the needle at the end of the day if you've got a willing investor, you know, I, I, I've seen people do that and nickel and diamond and it never works out well.

You know, a lot of times if it's a reasonable deal, I'd say it's reasonable and, and take it, it helps you get your deal done. 

**Athena:** Hmm. 

**Matt:** Um, but yeah, I think under capitalizing and, and cash still is king at the end of the day and it's better to have more than less at closing. Uh, I've, I've just seen that recently.

Um, I'm trying to [01:02:00] think of other, um, you know, we've seen some deals that have a little revenue concentration, customer concentration that doesn't knock us, uh, out initially. Um, we, we try to mitigate that and underwrite that. Um, we had a deal recently that had a, a big FedEx. Concentration. Um, obviously with tariffs and that kind of thing, FedEx is all over the map.

And so, you know, it's just understanding the risk. Yeah. Trying to mitigate it. If you can mitigate it, then move on. If you can't, then don't do the deal. Um, but I don't know, um, those are a few real life examples of things that kind of come to mind. Um, trying to think of anything else that just, um, I don't that those come to mind, I guess, but yeah, 

**Athena:** cash, cash at closes is, you know, it can't be overstated, but, you know, 'cause like it can, people are like, okay, I've got enough money to pay for [01:03:00] everything I need to get this deal done.

Yeah. And then it's one no cash in the bank account, like Oopsies. Yeah. And this deal 

**Matt:** drag on and cost escalate. It's something to really pay attention to. It, it, it, you've gotta sources and uses, but you know. Those uses kinda keep changing and maybe moving up and the sources don't move up with it and Right.

It can kind of leave you in a lurch. And so it's, yeah. Um, it's not a good place to be, but 

**Athena:** it's not, but it's, it's, you can never say it enough. So, uh, Andrew in Oklahoma, what is your question? And I've got a, a few more after that and anybody else that has some questions, please feel free to put your hands up.

**Andrew:** Yeah, I've got a, a couple actually. Um, first off, Matt, thanks for, thanks for talking. I don't, you 

**Athena:** bet. 

**Andrew:** I guess I can only speak for myself, but sometimes the deep de mystic izing of any kind of private equity is really important. 'cause I know, especially for me, you know, I didn't come from a finance background, so having a [01:04:00] conversation with private debts.

Terrifying because you just don't know what they're, you feel judged the second you start the conversation. And if I don't use enough syllables in my words, I feel, feel intimidated. So no judgment here. 

**Matt:** No judgment here. Oh no, I, 

**Andrew:** you know, you've helped. Seriously, I mean, I, I appreciate that talking to, it helps that you're southern too, for the record.

I can, I just inherently trust you maybe a little bit more. Um, 

**Athena:** so, 

**Andrew:** uh, uh, so the, the specific questions, oh, and the last thing I would say, anytime I hear Stone Angel, I can think of, is this a spinal tap? I'm sure you hear that every, so, oh yeah, for sure. Yeah. Um, but I love, love the name. So when you guys are making those kinds of decisions, I would assume you have some version of a, you know, you guys wouldn't call it a loan committee, but what, what does that look like?

What does that approval process look like? I mean, is that a, I mean, once Matt says this guy or gal's, good, we're set, or are you gonna have to go pitch that specific deal to a committee and. What was that process like? 

**Matt:** Great. Yeah, great question. I appreciate you [01:05:00] asking that. Uh, and I'll, I'll demystify that a little bit.

At least for us, every, every firm is different, but, um, you know, we do a little more work on the front end, uh, before we get to a term sheet stage. What does that mean? Uh, we'll compile some information. We actually do a, you know, three or four or five page memo, uh, internal, um, that we then we meet twice a week on new deals and Tuesday or Thursday, and we'll circulate that memo.

And the decision makers, our investment committee members are on those calls and so they have seen the deal, they have opined on the deal, good, bad or indifferent, suggest a different structure, suggest whatever. Um. We then come back, we probably, we generally have a list of questions after that meeting. So Andrew, we'd come back to you, Hey, uh, let's, let's go through these 10 things that we just don't know the answers to help us out.

We then probably go back to the committee, [01:06:00] uh, the following week, and once we get satisfactory answers there, we'll issue a term sheet so we can issue a term sheet. I mean, we've done it in as quick as a week. I mean, we, you know, there it is. There's not a lot of time that not a lot of wasted time on our end.

We would issue that term sheet to you. You would say, Hey Matt, gosh, I like this. It looks good. Um, hey, can we tweak the rate? Can we tweak this? I don't like this. Negotiate a little bit on it. Um, and then once you say, Hey, this is, this looks good. It's a go. Um, then we would, um, start our diligence process, which is generally me and.

One other guy. Generally we like to do an onsite visit. Uh, we like to kick the tires. Um, you know, I know a lot of sellers are skittish about having a diligence day on site when they might not ev [01:07:00] they may, nobody knows probably the transactions going on. 

**Athena:** Mm-hmm. 

**Matt:** I'm always a little not weirded out by that.

Um, and I get it, but we've done diligence days at nine o'clock at night. We've done 'em at, you know, noon. We've done 'em after the shift ends. I mean, we've done all kinds of things, but, um, I think it's important to be on site, kick the tires. Um, and so yeah, once we do that, we've got legal going. Um, and so if you combine all that together, is it a 60 day process?

I always say legal always gets in the way and slows things down. Um, but call it a, call it a 60 day process for, for Stonehenge, uh, and, um, that investment committee, uh, we generally call the formal investment committee at any time. But Andrew, for our process, [01:08:00] um, our guys have seen this deal once, initially, two for a follow up q and a, and maybe a third time.

They know there's no surprises coming from us. We're not gonna change the terms on you. Yeah. There's not any of that. Gotcha. Bait and switch stuff. So we try to do, what I'm trying to tell you is we do a little more work on the front end, so we don't change, we, we stand behind our term sheets and our deal sheets.

Um, and so it might be a little more painful for you in the beginning, but we're trying to, to really understand the business and help, you know, help you see things that maybe you don't or, or, or we, you know, we might know. So I don't know. Does that, did I directly answer that for you? 

**Andrew:** No, you did. Yeah. That process, that process helps, helps a lot.

No, I, I appreciate that. And yeah, and that's kind of the, always the fear. You never know, you know, you go before bank committee, you get some degree of commitment and then they, you know, they close on a big deal and suddenly that capital isn't available. Or you've got some, you know, 

**Athena:** that's right. You go 

**Andrew:** through a audit [01:09:00] and suddenly they don't wanna 

**Athena:** Yeah.

**Andrew:** Put that money out there. Okay. The, the, the set. Thank you for answering that. The, the second question. Is assuming that you all want participate in a deal from an equity position, um, do you guys have kind of thresholds at at which your, um, kind of the arrows in your, whoever from a resource perspective become eligible?

Or is it, you know, whether you got 5, 10, 15, 20, 40%, you guys are just kind of there as resources. 

**Matt:** You know, whether we have a half million bucks or we have five of equity in a deal, I think we're gonna operate the same way. We're here to help you. We're in it, we're rowing in the same boat with you. Uh, yeah, we want to see it succeed, so we'll bring whatever we need to bring no matter the size of that transaction.

Okay. 

**Andrew:** Yeah. Cool. That's great. 

**Matt:** Yeah. 

**Andrew:** Thank you. 

**Athena:** Thanks 

**Andrew:** for being here. 

**Matt:** Yeah, sure. Glad, thanks for having me. 

**Athena:** Awesome. Thanks for your questions, Andrew. Andrew. Um, so, you know, one of the big pain in the butts with, uh, SBA is you [01:10:00] can't structure in things like earnouts. So I'm assuming there's no restrictions on structuring from the buyer's perspective when working with someone like you.

Obviously you need, it needs to make sense to you and everything, but we're able to use some of those other tools that we're not able to use when we look at DA. 

**Matt:** Yeah, for sure. We're, we're, uh, on the deal Monday. We're re uh, since it's an add-on, we're restructuring, uh, our, uh, CEO's, uh, earn a, I mean he had a, a big seller note and there was, um, I'm sorry, it was more of a success fee.

So we're, we're restructuring all that. We can use all of those things that are at our disposal, um, and used to seeing that in just about every deal, all those. You know, it sure helps. And it's, there's a lot of ways to structure a deal. We can consider all those different ways. Yeah, and you're right. I mean, SBA is getting a little tighter on all that.

Uh, but [01:11:00] we're, that's what we do. So, 

**Athena:** yeah. But we look, you know, forgivable performance notes are like not a tool that a lot of people know or use a lot, but like, you're kind of clipped on when and how and for what purpose. You can use it. So we can use it to like, maintain revenue, but we can't incentivize unless there's been that past performance.

So it's kind of like, well, the owner's telling me that it's gonna do all these things in the future, and I'd love to incentivize them to help me get there, but I can't do it when I have a 

**Matt:** Yeah. Yeah. We're, we're big fans. We're big fans of that structure. Yeah. 

**Athena:** Amazing. Yeah. And, um, I'm curious, you know, there's been such a, I mean, ETA is like the new Gold Rush, right?

Yeah. It's the new real estate. Like everybody realized like, oh, I'm not getting the money. I thought I was getting in real estate. Let me buy businesses. Thanks to a lot of folks on the internet selling the dream. So I'm curious, you, and I feel like, I don't know, maybe I'm, you guys are kind of staying under [01:12:00] the radar, although I saw one of your colleagues at like the an ETA event, but out in Florida.

So how has this, like ETA surge impacted you guys, if at all? 

**Matt:** Yeah. You, you know, oh gosh, five years ago, um, well, we didn't know what ETA was at the time, and really that whole independent sponsor model was still probably pretty fresh if I, if I'm thinking right, uh, maybe more than five years ago. But I think I mentioned now it's, it's just about every deal we see.

Is, uh, a sponsored deal. And, um, it's just the proliferation. Uh, and we even have one of our portfolio company sponsors. He is a prolific, uh, poster and, uh, I'm not gonna mention any names, but you, you'll, you can find him out there, but he is prolific [01:13:00] and, um, it's, it's everywhere. And, uh, you know, good for us that we've kind of, um, developed that network of people.

We go to some of those conferences, uh, and again, it's all about people. And you're, if you're back in the right operator, um, you know, good things are gonna happen. And so, yeah, it's really been a boon for our business, uh, just because it's most, every deal we do, um, is, is a sponsored, uh, deal. Yeah. So I never Yeah.

**Athena:** Bringing, bringing good deal flow your way. Are you getting a lot of folks that have no business doing this though, as a result of that? Oh yeah, sure. 

**Matt:** You, yeah. You, we get that. Um, yeah, we see a lot of that. And it is, it's the, you super young kid. We've got some young people on here, but you know, really young kid that just graduated.

I mean, they don't know. They [01:14:00] can't spell p and l and hey, you know, this is great. But, um, yeah. And so, yeah, we see all kinds for sure. Um, and when you have a discussion with them, I always like that. I always take a call and it's like, Hey, okay, you need to think about this, this, and this. And it's like, oh no, I have not even, I can't write a check into this business.

My uncle can't write a check into this business. I, you know, I thought I was just gonna get it for free and make a big management fee and. Oh, I, I want to charge a, a closing fee, but I want to take it out at closing and I don't wanna put any money in the deal. Well, you know what? You just, I'm taking all the risk here.

I don't like that as an investor. I don't like taking all the risk. I'd like a little sharing of the risk with the, the sponsor. So yeah, you see all, all kinds. 

**Athena:** Well, so I, I'd love to explain that a little bit 'cause um, everybody here is [01:15:00] planning on, uh, being the operator of the business, but independent sponsor.

Um, for the folks here, I think most of I've, I've talked about it with some of you, but it's essentially, it's, it's almost like being a fund manager, but it's on a specific business that you're buying. So you go out, you find a business, then you go and raise the capital for that specific business, and then you charge like a percentage as a management fee.

Yes, a closing fee, but you actually like hire people to run the business. You're just managing your portfolio of investments, but where it's different like raising money for a fund and then you go out and find the businesses. So independent sponsor is this larger play that people make in these larger businesses, but there's, there's this line, you know, in this level, the five to 10 million plus range where the like sponsors reach into like self-funded searchers.

So everyone here is self-funded searcher. Uh, uh, what are [01:16:00] you seeing as a mix of self-funded searcher operator versus sponsor? Do you have a preference? I 

**Matt:** don't have a preference first. Um, and you know, I'm trying to think back. Um, gosh, it might be 50 50 from operator versus not. Um, yeah, and I don't lean one way or the other, honestly.

Um, God, that's a good question. I should have, I should think through that a little bit more and give a better answer. But, um, it might be 50 50 from what we see maybe. Um, and again, no, no real preference to it, um, other than the, but other than, other than when somebody wants to take all their capital at closing out of the deal and, you know, leaving everybody else holding the bag, uh, I have a problem philosophically with that.

But other than that, I'm probably good. 

**Athena:** I dunno. Yeah, well it, [01:17:00] it doesn't mean, so I'll break it down. 'cause I, I remember my head just spinning at the independent sponsor co It was so funny 'cause I was just like, there's gonna be like five people there, it'll be great. And I walked in and there's like thousands and it was like, oh my God.

Like where has this been hiding? What is this? Um, so you know, like, just like there's bad fund managers that get people to invest. There's, there's people trying to do this independent sponsor thing where they, they find a deal. They wanna charge all of these fees to find the deal, close on the deal, manage the deal, but they're not actually operating the business and not putting any of their own money in.

So they're going around and collecting money from other people to buy this business, and then they get all of these additional fees and upside for themselves for finding, closing, managing the business. And then the only people with their money at risk are not the sponsor themselves. It's everybody that gave them the money.

And then, yeah, I think it was you that told me like, you know, sponsors that like [01:18:00] buy the business and then hand you the keys kind of thing was, I don't know if that was you, I feel like it was around that time. But they'll do this whole thing and then be like, here you go back to the investors 

**Matt:** and, and we, we love paying, I mean not love, but we would pay above average market management fees if somebody's doing real work.

If you're not doing real work, it doesn't make any sense. And so mm-hmm. I mean, we just try to be practical about it. And if you're not doing real work, I don't, I don't know really. How do you justify that? And so, you know, we've walked away from deals and there's a local firm in Dallas, they are notorious for Yeah.

Stripping out a bunch of capital at closing, charging a above market management fee and not doing anything. And we just, I've known the guy for 25 years. We have never done one deal with him. And I think it's safe to say we probably won't because of that reason. It's just not the way we wanna [01:19:00] operate, you know?

Mm-hmm. It's, Hey, we're all in this boat together. It's hard enough. And, you know, I don't know, sorry, I'm on a soapbox now and I'll get off of it. But, you know, those kinds of things matter to investors. Um, and some for us, it, some of those kind of deeply matter, you know, I mean, um. Yeah. So 

**Athena:** yeah, I, I agree. I think that's, uh, you know, there's, there's a way to do all of this with integrity.

You know, I think there's a whole world of, there's, there's people out there that believe you need to screw other people over in order to make money or get ahead, but it's, as, as one of my investors on, on, uh, when I was raising money, he's like, there's a difference between short-term greedy and long-term greedy.

Yeah. Right. And like long-term, greedy people do the right thing, act out of integrity because it, it pays off when you do right by people. You do good bus business 'cause people wanna keep doing business with you. But that short-term, greedy, like you might make some money [01:20:00] like initially, but um, you know, you're not, people aren't gonna wanna do business with you and it's gonna clip things in the long term.

Um, so I know we've only got you for a few more minutes. Does anyone else have any questions in the meantime? And, um. Matt, I don't mean to put you on the spot, but maybe you can rattle off all the state funds while folks might be thinking about any final questions. 

**Matt:** Yeah, I think I can. Um, okay. We'll start West and, uh, Utah and Nevada.

**Justin:** Okay. 

**Matt:** Um, oh, Oklahoma, although we're probably fully invested in Oklahoma, but put Oklahoma on the list. Our newest fund is in Missouri. Uh, if anybody's in Missouri or has a deal in Missouri, we would be all over. Uh, especially if it was between St. Louis and Kansas City, we would be extremely aggressive on something like that.

Um, Ohio, uh, Connecticut, [01:21:00] um, gosh, how many is that, uh, Mississippi? Um, is that, what is that six or seven maybe? Hopeful. I've got 

**Athena:** seven so far. Yeah. 

**Matt:** Um, I. Pennsylvania, geez. Eight. There you go. Pennsylvania. 

**Justin:** Oh, those are 

**Matt:** so ran. Those are so random, y'all. If, again, if you ever see something in one of those states, I really need to be the first call that you make.

I really do. Um, so yeah, those are the eight that we have active today. Um, and are eager, eager to put some money to work in, in those geographies. For sure. 

**Athena:** And outside of those geographies, what, you said you're kind of in the middle of closing another, so what's the timing look like if somebody wants to come to you, if they're outside of those geographies?

**Matt:** Yeah, so we're, we're really looking at new deals with that SBIC fund that we have yet to close because we think any, if we start talking about a deal today, it will be the fourth quarter [01:22:00] probably before that closes, despite what I said earlier about 60 days. 

**Athena:** Yeah. 

**Matt:** Um, and so we're, we're having conversations now.

Getting those kind of in the queue for when we do have a first close, we think that first close will be around Labor Day. Um, and so, uh, yeah, we'll, you know, it, it's good to have some in the pipeline for, for that fund, but have, have capital to deploy. Um, and, and yeah, eager to, especially in those states, eager to get that money invested.

**Athena:** Fantastic. So basically summarize all of that is come talk to Matt if you got a deal that might be of interest. I 

**Matt:** hope you guys think I'm easy to approach. I'm, I'll be upfront with you. Um, I'm easy to get ahold of. I'm responsive on email and phone calls. You can call, text, email, any, any time, LinkedIn message, whatever else I, you know, um, I'll, I'll respond to you.

[01:23:00] Um, and I'm, we're here to help if we can. So call on me anytime. 

**Athena:** And I can attest to that with a, you know, gosh, like. Two years, I think, communicating with you so. Has it been that long? I feel like it was around that time. It's been a while. Yeah, it has. Um, Matt, this has been so awesome, um, to, to pick your brain about this world.

I think it's, it's really fascinating and probably really exciting for a lot of folks here that are not super comfortable with some of the SBA stuff. But everyone, all of our clients are, are amazing, you know, backgrounds, very capable operators, very smart, very driven, and wanna get a deal done. And, and knowing that there's alternative capital options with people as Integris and awesome as yourself is, is exciting.

So, um, really appreciate you taking the time to break this all down. Appreciate you also offering your contact details, so we'll make sure to share that with everybody, [01:24:00] um, along with the replay. And yeah, this has been awesome. Um, I hope everybody else got as much value and excitement as I did. 

**Matt:** Cool. Yeah.

Appreciate the nice comment. Thank, thank you. And, and yeah, call on us anytime. 

**Athena:** Amazing. Well, uh, great to see everyone as always. We'll see you next week. Matt, thank you again so much. You bet. I'm sure you'll be hearing from quite a few folks here. Um, have a great rest of your day, everyone. Take care. 

**Matt:** Thanks.

Good to see you everybody. 

**Athena:** Bye.
