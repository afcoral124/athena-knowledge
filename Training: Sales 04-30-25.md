0:00 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  How's it going?

0:02 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  It's going good. I'm working on getting a second meeting of the day booked.

0:11 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Great. Is that in the folks that filled out the application?

0:19 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  Not even the recent ones. This Heidi lady is from November. So when she filled out her app, she got back to me.  And then do you know a guy named Jim Sullivan?

0:31 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  The name sounds familiar. Isn't that a broker?

0:34 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  He knows you from, or Jim Allison, sorry.

0:40 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Oh, yeah. Okay. He might be a time waster.

0:44 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  It would be good to get some reps in anyway.

0:48 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah. I, so he, I used to be a business coach and he got in touch with me about, like starting a business a couple of years ago.

0:59 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  And then. Yeah.

1:00 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  You know, he's potentially doing coaching with me and nothing ever came to that. And I don't think he knows anything about buying a business.  I think he was trying to get a hold of me to, like, talk about whatever in his life. You know, one of those pick my brains.  I'll feel better when I have a conversation and I won't do anything about it. He has a personal connection from, like, a million years ago in my, like, music production days.

1:26 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  So he was the boss of mine or whatever.

1:30 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Like, we worked on a couple shows. It was very, like, freelance or whatever back then. So, yeah. So I can't imagine he will know much about the process.

1:40 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  If he does, it will surprise me. Yeah. Well, like I said, it'll be just good to get reps in regardless.  So I'm not too concerned about it. Awesome.

1:55 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So I've got to end on time today. I have a plan we'll need to prepare for, but this. The three things I want to cover today are end-of-day reports.  I've asked Anka to do a notification for you. So if you could start doing those, that'll be really helpful to kind of see what you're doing.  And then I get a lot of personal introductions of potential clients. So the way that we've been handling it in the past is it's like, hey, great to meet you.  Fill out this form, and then we'll be in touch after that. So I wanted to get your thoughts, because obviously, like, the less friction, the better.  So, like, we can still do that and have Kate just have them fill out the form, and then you review it and figure out how to respond to it.  But a lot of these, like I said, are personal introductions. Like, one's come through from Chris, our, like, QV provider.  And this comes through from a friend and also potential client. So I like to kind of handle. A little bit more VIP just so the referrers keep sending people our way.  So that's my only thought is like, would it be a better experience to just be like, hey, let me like introduce you to Austin and he can take you through, you know, guide you or whatever we want to say there versus, hey, go fill out this in personal form.

3:23 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  No, I'm like, I agree with the white glove aspect, Athena, like, whatever you want to do on that side of things, I'm sure it's more than fine.  Or even just like, I'm like, hey, I'd love to get you in touch with, and I just don't like sales has kind of a negative connotation, you know what I mean?  So it would like, would love to get you connected with somebody on my team, book time on their calendar below, something to that effect, and you could CC me on it, and then I'll just follow him on.  Or like, just CC me, like, hey, would love to introduce you to Austin, he's typically the one that will kind of walk through the first portion of process.  And then if it's something that makes sense, we'll connect a bit later on down the road. But yeah, however you want to execute that, that's totally fine with me.

4:09 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  My speaker is still... Can you say something again?

4:14 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  Yes, ma'am. Yes, ma'am.

4:16 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Can you hear me? we go. Okay. I've been having issues with my speaker. Yeah, let's make it as little of a lift as possible for Kate.  Like, I don't want her having to chase links and stuff like that. So it's either we send them to the forum or we just loop you in because she's managing my inbox.  I would feel better about it being like, hey, let me get, like, thanks so much for the introduction. I'm looping in Austin for my team who, you know, handles the first part of the process of working with us.  And he can walk you through it, whatever. I'll just leave a brief and then you can schedule a call with them.  And then, you know, I'm assuming if they're... Being introduced to us by these people who know our business model and kind of know that they're more likely to be qualified, which is like, I've only been doing the forums out of necessity.

5:13 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  It's like, I didn't have the bandwidth to take all these calls.

5:16 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So I think while you do, it would be better to just load you up and then you can start saying like, okay, let's put some limiters in place if it comes too much.

5:26 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, yeah. Well, and that's what I was telling Anka yesterday when she was talking to me about the forum.  like, maybe below 200 grand we leave open, but like there was some gold in like some of those older leads that you had in there.  Just like looking through them where it's like one guy was like zero to 99, but then in his message, it was like, have signed commitments from investors, already have a pre-approval letter through Live Oak where it's like, I'll take that call every day of the week.  Yeah, I saw that one.

5:57 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  We just didn't have any time on my calendar to book it. So yeah, I agree with you there. Like someone that's hungry and has already gotten investor commitment and stuff, they're probably going to work even harder because they have like investors to do stuff with.  So I'm great with that. Okay, so those were my two things. So I'll communicate that to Kate and Anka that when, you know, good referral sources send us people that we'll just loop you in rather than sending them to a form.

6:27 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, I think that's, that's like preferred on my side anyway. Great.

6:32 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, I wanted to like, again, we've been doing not the ideal way of doing things because of my bandwidth.  So they don't necessarily know sales is like a respond immediately. And so I'm trying and Kate's also two weeks in poor thing.  She's drowning a little bit because Anka has been working with me for a year and a half and we're both super fast.  So she's trying to wrap her head around everything and keep up. I'm like sales need, like introductions need a response within 20 minutes.  We're ours. So, yeah.

7:04 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  It's crazy, the metrics on that, Athena. I don't know if you know anything about it, but it's like your conversion rate to meeting drops like 30% every five minutes of time that goes by.  the faster that you can get to those, the better. I don't think that's necessarily as relevant for a business like this, right?  But just historically, or looking at industry average, it's insane.

7:27 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, well, I mean, at the moment, it's been like two weeks to two months to book a call. So being able to get on the calendar same week is like amazing.  So I'll update her on that. There's also a lot of folks that come through LinkedIn. So I'll have her.

7:49 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  Are we connected on LinkedIn? Yeah, we're connected.

7:53 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Do you have an Acquimatch on your profile yet?

7:56 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  But great.

7:58 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay, so we can just loop you in on a message on LinkedIn. Also, there's a lot of people getting in touch there, so I'll make sure they follow that up today so you get some fresh leads.  How's the other looking through the forums and everything going?

8:14 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  You said looking through the forums?

8:16 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, how's that going? Like, just picking up those forums and trying to get them scheduled?

8:24 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  Oh, yeah. So what I've done today, I can just share my screen and show you if you're curious.

8:30 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, let me give you access.
  SCREEN SHARING: Austin started screen sharing - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/288187693?timestamp=517.037677

8:33 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  There you go. Yeah, I've just been sending out, like, this is the message that I was sending. Hi, Heidi.  So I reached out about working with Acromash back in February after seeing some of our content on LinkedIn. So, like, I'm just putting, like, a date source, and then we recently opened a few new client spots.  I'd love to learn more about your goals and what prompt would be to get in touch. And then just, like, a little value statement here.  And then asking for time on the calendar. Love it. So that's what I'm doing this morning. And then I'll probably call behind these all tomorrow.  But just like where, like, my assumption is a lot of these folks have nine to five jobs. I figured it was better to, like, send them a calendar link, see if they book.  If not, pick up the phone and actually call them. But I don't know if you have a heavy preference there at the end.

9:25 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Just real quick, I'm noticing, do you have the HubSpot?

9:34 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  Are you talking about this?
  ACTION ITEM: Set up HubSpot Chrome extension for email tracking/logging
 - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/288187693?timestamp=575.9999

9:36 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  No, it doesn't. So are you emailing people out of Gmail or out of HubSpot?

9:40 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  Out of HubSpot.

9:42 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Oh, okay. So the response to it, are you going to respond?

9:46 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  I was going to just respond through Gmail. That's a good point.

9:50 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, if you're going to do that, you need to, I mean, you should set it up anyway. You need to get your HubSpot connection on your Chrome.  Is it Chrome that you use?

9:59 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, Chrome extension. I got you. Yeah, I'll set that up today.

10:02 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, so then you're just making sure you're tracking and logging those conversations.

10:06 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  And I know I like when I think if I put in the extension, it gives me like open tracking as well.

10:13 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, yeah. If you have the extension in like on the right hand side in Gmail, you can see the deal, you can log a new conversation to a deal, that sort of thing.  So Let me send Honka a message.

10:37 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  I'm like, that's me. I know how to set that up.

10:45 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  I think we might need to get you on Surf, too, for LinkedIn.

10:52 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  They're talking about LinkedIn automation?

10:55 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  No, to be able to track things in HubSpot.

10:58 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  Oh, I got you. I got I Thank

11:02 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Because when you have conversations on LinkedIn, we have a program that you can log it to their deal and to their contact record.  So I just sent her a message to make sure you have all the tech set up. Okay. Okay, so cool.  I just sent them both messages. So, yeah, and Anka, you talking We'll make sure that you've got all the techs set up so that whether you're in HubSpot or your Gmail, that you'll be able to log everything and keep it in one place.  Does she have a concern?

12:24 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, she was just like, I was surprised I never heard back. Maybe you can also help me understand that when we speak live.  I'm to chat to her to land a call. So just like addressing her concern if we want to schedule something and open it 12 or 1.

12:39 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay, how are you planning on addressing that?

12:44 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  Just telling her that we have a large amount of interest and didn't have bandwidth until recently and then brought on additional support to be able to handle additional clients, like something to that effect.

12:57 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, when they, I mean, when they book, you see the video, it's like. You're on the wait list, you know, so we'll get back.
  ACTION ITEM: Watch all client onboarding videos to understand context
 - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/288187693?timestamp=782.9999  So it's not like that wasn't communicated. It's like, thanks for signing up. You're on the wait list. Here's a video to watch.  Have you seen all those videos that they get when they go through the process?

13:13 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  I haven't gone through and watched every single one of them, transparently, Athena, but I can today for sure.

13:19 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, why don't you do that to see the context of how they're walking in? Because there's a different route, depending on whether they got, like, sent to a book a call, and whether they got sent to you're on the wait list.

13:37 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  Cool, I got you. Hi, Heidi. That makes sense.

13:59 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  But yeah, we do say. You're on the waitlist, we're in high demand, etc.

14:04 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  And she put like zero dollars in her forms.

14:08 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Well, that also is a reason, so you should call that out. Be like, hey, we can't work with people that don't have money to invest.  So, you know, when we see that, there's a deprioritization that happens on the waitlist, but however you want to say it.

14:26 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  But, yeah, she put zero in, like, I'd like to speak live prior to providing additional info, which is like, she really sounds like she's going to be a headache.  Yeah, and like how she responded to that message after I reached out. I watched a call with, who are we talking to tomorrow?

14:42 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  What's her name? Shauna.

14:45 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, I watched that call and I'm like, oh. Like, I get it.

14:51 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  You know what, like, okay, so my read on her was also what you got from it.

14:55 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, you're just like, okay, lady, like, whatever you have to say, why the heck? Can I not do this?  Full screen, invite, view, high video panel, show call, edit, window, move focus, always show meeting controls. There we go.  That's why. Cool. I was like, why can I not close out of this? Yeah, I got the same reason on her that she's just like going to be.  It's just like, you've already gone through and like done, like hodgepodge all this stuff together, but there's no continuity between like each one of the individual people that you're talking to.  It's like, you got a financial model from somebody and went and did an accelerator with somebody else. And now you're looking at investors.  Like you're just have spread yourself. Like my read on that is like, you've spread yourself so thin, like you're just going to drown in opportunity, right?  It's like, it's great that you're doing this on your own. And it sounds like you have some structure in place, but like the read that I got from that call, it's like, you're just so scattered that like, you're not  And I'm up doing any of those things really, really well.

16:03 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  And she thinks she's in a good place.

16:07 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  Like she thinks she just needs deal flow.

16:09 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  You know, I'm joining an accelerator. I'm like, okay. Don't get me wrong.

16:17 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  Like there's value in accelerators.

16:19 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  But like. Depending on the accelerator. don't know if I've heard from. And, you know, there's always an ulterior motive from the accelerator.  Like are you going to take equity in your business? Do you want to do that? Like, you know. So, yeah.  I don't know. I've been very low energy. So when I feel people being super resistant. I'm just kind of like, okay.  Like, you know everything. You're not warming up to me. Like, I'm seriously the easiest person to warm up to in the world.  And if you're not giving me anything. I'm like, let's all just energy match then.

16:53 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  Yeah. I'm like, I noticed you're really flat in that call. And I'm like, who is this lady?

16:59 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  She She She She was was was was She was like. Thank Giving me nothing, and I'm like, okay, like, wow, you know.  I fell away a little bit yesterday, but I think it's just like that gentleman was stoic, you know, and I got like a few head nods in there, but like not as many as I would have liked.  Oh, he was so passionate, though. I loved it. Like, I think he'd make, if he can make the numbers work, and he can make the timing work, that's my biggest concern, is like, he'll need to move, right?  But I was talking to Cole about it last night, like being signed up for entrepreneurship classes while he's going through a transition would be a great thing.  And, you know, Lindsay kept her job for like six months after they bought their first business and a couple months into her second one.  So he can do it, but I just don't, I don't want him to push away opportunities because it's too early, you know, that'll burn our relationships for him.

17:55 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  Well, this is, this was something else that I was thinking about last night, too, talking about that deal. Is like, what happens if we find him a business in Florida, and he's got six months of school left?

18:08 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Right. He's gonna have to make it. Yeah, that's a really good point. It's something you want to talk through with him.

18:14 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, yeah. It's like, hey, like, maybe we start our initial search within Greater Texas, like some and like, focus on opportunities where like, you can go in, maybe like a couple times a week to like, check in, make sure things are going well.  But like, they do have some infrastructure in place where like, you'll be able to finish school in the process, you know, like, think that might be a good approach.  And then just like, talk about the different options, and then like, really push that conversation to like, the onboarding component would be my thought process there.

18:42 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Or now is just not a good time.

18:45 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, that's fair.

18:47 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  You know, this is this is the thing that we need to be discerning with clients is like, I don't, if we don't think he'll be able to be successful.  Well, you know, then then that's kind of our duty to be like, hey, dude. We love you. We think you're amazing.  But given the commitment to school and you not wanting to buy a business for 12 months, that's a reasonable amount of time.  It could take that long, but we need you to be able to move sooner if the right opportunity comes up.  And if you're not able to do that, then we need to talk about start time.

19:20 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, I think that's smart. I think that's smart. Tell me this, Athena. Do you want to be on that call on Friday or do want me to just run it?

19:28 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Well, so I thought we were going to try to schedule it with the slot that we had booked tomorrow.

19:34 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  You said you had finals and I was traveling to Brazil.

19:36 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  would have dug into that, though, and been like, do you have an hour and a half tomorrow to go through this?  So I always pivot them to my time that works for me, right? And it's like, ooh, schedule's a little tight.  So I am booked solid 12 hours a day right now. So, yeah, like, just, I won't be able to take the call.

19:58 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  you're fine. You're fine. I'm like, I just, yeah, I... I wanted to check and see if you wanted to pop into that with me.  But if you're not able, or you're buried in work right now, and I get that, so no worries. And apologies for scheduling that Friday and not digging in a bit further.

20:12 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, I mean, I should have clarified that. Like, hey, try to push him to the onboarding session tomorrow. But it looks like we'll probably only have the Shauna call for me to shadow you tomorrow and then leave you to it.  So I was hoping with the time we have today to just at least start running through it and see where we get to.  I need to end at, like, 11.45 to get prepped for my next client call. How's that sound?

20:42 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, let's do it. Let's do it. I already have all of Shauna's stuff prepped as well.

20:47 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Great.

20:49 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  So I, and, yeah, she was showing me the GPTs for your script as well. So that sounds rad. The, uh, let me do something.  I don't. I deleted the other, whatchamacallit, and I'm struggling to get PowerPoint set up today, so.

21:12 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Um, okay, have you talked about that?

21:19 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, she just got me logins, and I got logged in, like, one minute before her schedule.

21:25 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Oh, okay, okay, cool. Yeah, she was waiting on me, she thought I had a license for five users, and I was like, I don't, please don't ever ask me to sort this out again.  It took me 30 minutes of trying to mess around with this, like, I don't care about saving a hundred dollars, I care about saving a half an hour of my time right now, so.  So let's do this. Um, and then we have time booked tomorrow afternoon, so I'll have to jump as soon as we're done with Shauna, um, we really need to try to keep it to an hour and a half.  Fathom her tomorrow, too, because it's going to look weird if I have to bail if you're still going.

22:07 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  I know the one ran a little long yesterday as well. And we have back-to-back meetings today where we have to keep that to an hour.  So that'll be good practice in terms of managing the clock in that process. But I was definitely aware that we were like 10 minutes long for yesterday as well.

22:26 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So, yeah, that was one point of feedback I was going to give you is like, I keep an eye on the clock when I'm at 1030.  I know I have like a few more questions and I try to get to the ending bit with the pitch by like 1035, 1040.

22:42 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  So, yeah. Yeah, that was 100% my fault.

22:48 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  No, it's the first time you're doing it. So it takes longer. So, yeah, it's all good. Just with my schedule and with those back-to-back.  We'll have to keep it on time. Otherwise, I look weird when I have to jump.

23:01 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, you're totally good. And I have this up, and then my script's going to be relevant based on what we talked about last time.

23:14 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  And are you going to just run, use Shauna's for the beginning part?

23:19 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, that was my plan, was just to do a dry run on Shauna, and then we'll have at least one under our belt before we dive into this tomorrow.  Perfect. This will be, like, maybe my fifth time talking through this.

23:40 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  All good. I'm going to keep answers super brief, just so you can, like, get practice, like, running through it, and I can make notes.

23:51 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  I'm going to call you, Shauna, though, because I don't want to insult you.
  ACTION ITEM: Configure PowerPoint for full-screen pres w/o visible tabs/bookmarks

23:58 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Sounds good.

24:00 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  Uh… Uh, I'm sorry. Uh, are you good? Can you see my screen?

24:06 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yes, I can. Is there a way for you to remove all the tabs and everything, though?

24:11 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  Um, yeah, I can just do this. I normally would do that. Okay. Bookmarked bar, I'll uncheck this. Can you still, I don't think you can see it.
  SCREEN SHARING: Austin started screen sharing - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/288187693?timestamp=1477.576433  No, I can't. There we go. Feta?

24:48 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Um, I shouldn't have it. Yes. Yeah, I'm still seeing your tab, but, um, it's cool for now.

24:57 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  There's not a way, I don't know how to do, there might be a way to do it.

25:01 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  There is, yeah. That's why I was going to ask you if you wanted me to show you how I set up my desktop, but go ahead and run it the way you're having it now.

25:08 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  That's fine. Yeah, yeah. I'll try and get all of that set up before my meeting with Anka, and then does she know how you have it set up on your site?

25:16 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  No.

25:17 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  Okay. Then I might need two minutes at time in the morning.

25:23 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  All good.

25:26 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  Or this afternoon, whatever's last. Okay, beautiful. I'm just going to dive right into this. Oh, I can't see your screen anymore, though.  You removed it. No, I know, but I'm not supposed to be sharing my screen yet at this point.

25:37 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Oh, right. Okay, cool.

25:39 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  Duh. No, you're good. You're good. I was just trying to be alive with it or real with it.

25:48 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, let's do it. You're right.

25:50 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  right. Well, thanks for popping in with me today, Athena. How's your day been?

25:56 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, good. Thanks, Busy.

25:58 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, I hear that. Champagne problems, right? Before we dive in, let me give you maybe a quick overview of what we'll cover in today's call.  First, we'll revisit some of the key points from our last conversation to make sure we're aligned. After that, I'll walk you through our services and really how they help you achieve your goals.  So finally, we'll discuss questions you might have and outline next steps. And just as a reminder, recording this call for note-taking purposes, how does that all sound to you?

26:28 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Sounds great.

26:29 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  Perfect. Well, do you have a clean sheet of paper or something to take notes with, Athena?

26:34 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, I've got one right in front of me.

26:37 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  Fantastic. And did you get a chance to watch the video that I sent over?

26:41 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, I did.

26:42 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  Fantastic. What did you think?

26:45 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Sounds about right, like what I've been experiencing myself.

26:50 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, it's definitely tough out there for an individual searcher, especially like managing this all by yourself while having a full-time job.  searcher searcher for an an individual A child of your own, right? And your relationship and all of that. So definitely understand.  But yeah, what stood out to you most from our last conversation, Athena?

27:11 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  I think it was just interesting hearing, you know, some of the things I need to think about for my search and the timeline, like how long it takes that makes me nervous.

27:27 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, makes sense. Well, if it's all right with you, I'd love to recap our last call, just to make sure we're all on the same page, if that works okay.

27:35 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, sounds great.

27:37 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  Perfect. So the last time we talked about the fact your main sticking point is that while you've been putting in serious hours on your search, like evenings, weekends, reaching out to brokers, the actual volume and quality of the deal flow just haven't been there.  And even with everything you've built, your CRM, the financial models, all the outreach you've been doing, it's still been tough to get consistent traction without spending...  And crazy amounts of money up front and really burning yourself out, right? And because of that, not only is it slowing down your timeline and making it harder to find the right business, but it's also holding you back from stepping into the next chapter you're working so hard for, leaving that W-2 behind and actually owning something that you can build and grow into a mission-driven business you're proud of, right?  Not just freedom and stability for your family, but because you want to work or want your work to actually mean something, to make a tangible impact, especially in areas like senior care or healthcare that really align with your values.  And also we talked about how if you can get that solved, if you can find the right business that fits your financial goals, your skills, and your timeline, the real dream here is to be an entrepreneur in your own right, to have the autonomy to grow your team, to build a company culture that actually reflects your values, and ultimately create something lasting.  Something that will let you have more control over your life while making a real difference. Now, did I miss anything or does that sound like we're still on the same page here, Athena?

29:11 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Sounds pretty accurate.

29:13 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  Awesome. So how are you feeling?

29:18 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Just kind of curious how you guys work.

29:21 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  Yeah. Well, we definitely got a lot to cover today. But before we move forward, is there anything else that you feel like I should know?

29:33 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  No, I don't think so.

29:35 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  Beautiful. Well, based on everything you've shared, I really think that what we do could be a great fit for you.  Because earlier you mentioned how frustrating it's been to juggle a demanding full-time job, raising your son and trying to chase down opportunities that either aren't the right fit or fall apart after deeper diligence.  And how overwhelming it can be to navigate all of that on your own. Especially when you're trying to be smarter.  How at risk, structure, deals creatively, and avoid making decisions that put your family in a tough spot.

30:10 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, that sounds about right.

30:13 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  Well, this is exactly what we help with our expertise is in guiding first-time buyers like yourself. People have drive the operational chops and vision, but just think the right structure, speed, and support behind them to actually get across the finish line.  And 100% of our clients have gotten to sign LOIs without wasting years spinning their wheels. We take care of the heavy lifting so you can focus on evaluating the right opportunities, really managing risk intelligently, and moving forward with confidence at a pace that works for your life and your family.  Does all that make sense?

30:47 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, that sounds good.
  SCREEN SHARING: Austin started screen sharing - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/288187693?timestamp=1856.626652

30:50 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  Perfect. So let me pop open my screen here, and we can just dive into it. So can you see me okay on your side, Athena?

31:00 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah.

31:02 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  So, AquaMatch, we like to think of ourselves as business matchmakers, right? But instead of finding your perfect mate, we're actually helping you find the perfect business.  So, the question becomes, like, why would anyone start a business when you can go out and buy a profitable one?  I don't have to tell you, Shauna, like, you've spent a lot of time when it comes to the startup ecosystem and understand a lot of the risks associated with, like, building a business zero to one and actually scaling out that opportunity.  So, we look at highly attractive assets that have been in business for typically at least five years, right? Focused on your unique skills, your unique skills, the background, as well as what you're looking for from a monetary perspective.  So, Athena's $20 million lesson, I'm sure you've heard the story, but if you haven't, it's a pretty cool one.  So, Athena was... Found the perfect business, right? Like something that she really enjoyed and wanted to dig into. The only problem, she was $3 million short in terms of what she needed to actually finance that opportunity and appeal attractive to the brokers that she was working with.  So over Labor Day weekend, she went out and raised $3 million only to make an offer that was ultimately declined.  And had she known about creative deal structures and really how to present a compelling offer, like she could have offered more than the strategic that actually won that opportunity and was absolutely the best person to run that business.  Right. But the thing about it was, was Athena might've been the best business owner, but she wasn't the best business buyer at the time.  Right. And that's really where, where Aqua match came from. So do you still have our, our focus is really on helping that 2%, right?  The 2% of people that actually end up buying a business. It's kind of an interesting statistic. A lot of people in the market are saying, hey, we want to take advantage of the silver tsunami.  A lot of that baby boomer generation moving into retirement. But the fact of the matter is, only two people out of 100 will actually ever move forward and sign on the dotted line.  So we're here to help the 2% of business owners or entrepreneurs that are actually serious about moving forward in this process.  So it's not just myself. We've got a fantastic team behind us. Athena is absolutely phenomenal at what she does.  She spends a ton of time working in the startup ecosystem, business consulting, have worked for Fortune 500, as well as like now working with business owners like yourself or entrepreneurs like yourself, really looking to transition into business ownership.  Anka is our head of operations. Kate's our chief of staff. Anka is fantastic in terms of like really operationalizing this process and providing you all the tools that you need to be successful.  We've got some support staff down below. Luke's the one that's actually going to be going out along with Athena, having these conversations with brokers and really moving these opportunities throughout the funnel.  So we're trusted by a ton of industry leaders. I don't know if you heard about us on Acquiring Mines, but we're partnered with Barlow and Williams here in Texas.  We've got great relationships with Live Oak Bank, the largest SBA lender in the U.S., both in terms of number of deals as well as dollars.  Athena is actually a facilitator in Cody's Community Contrarian Thinking, and then she's taught entrepreneurship at the McComb School of Business at UT in Austin.  So tons of great relationships. Our clients are really loving their experience with us. These are a handful of the deals that we've been able to source on their behalf.  So you'll see 2X off-market med spas here in Texas. We actually had about five or six opportunities in front of them.  Moving forward with two of them. So lots of great success, both looking at off market and on market opportunities.  So you'll see some testimonials here. This one's probably my favorite. When we close, it is 100% because of the support and services that you are able to provide for us.  So that's talking about us here at Accomatch and really how they wouldn't have seen as much success without us.  And we did more in our first month with you than we did in six months on our own, right?  So that just speaks to the power of having a competent team behind you. So really what we're focused on is search simplified.  In the world of business acquisitions, finding the perfect match is not an easy thing to do. So we focus on the hard aspect, making sure that that top of funnel is full and really simplify that process.  So you can go from no deal flow, like struggling to find things on biz by sell to actually being an owner in as little as 12 months.  So do you still have that pen and paper? Perfect. Handy, Athena.

36:02 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yep. Got it right here.

36:03 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  Great. So on that piece of paper, I want you to write out one through five with a good bit of space between them to take notes on each.  So one, two, three, four, and five.

36:16 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Got it. Perfect.

36:18 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  So let me preface this by saying everything we do is all customized on what's best for the client. But there are five steps to take you from no good deal prospects to business owner in 12 months or less that we take every single client through.  So sound good to you?

36:35 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, sounds great.

36:36 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  Perfect. So the first thing we want to focus on is becoming the right buyer, right? Most first-time buyers approach the acquisition process backwards.  They're focusing on finding the deal before they even define what success looks like. And they think they just need to find a good deal, but they fail to consider whether that business actually aligns with their skills, goals, and lifestyle.  And that's a huge mistake, right? A business isn't... It's an investment. It's your livelihood. And with your personal guarantee and financial future on the line, the wrong decision could literally mean financial ruin.  So getting it right is absolutely critical. It needs to be something that gets you out of bed when things get tough.  And no matter how good that business is, things will inevitably get tough. And that's the reality of being a small business owner.  So instead of making blind assumptions, we guide you through our right buyer framework and create a detailed acquisition profile.  And the first thing we're going to do is align with your strengths. We help you define the industries and business models that fit really your skill set, experience, and preferences.  The second thing we'll do is craft your investor profile. We develop a compelling buyer narrative that makes you attractive to lenders and sellers.  We set up financing early, ensuring you're seen as a serious fundable buyer. And the result? You actually stop wasting time on businesses that  And start making offers a whole lot sooner on pre-bedded businesses that actually feel like the right fit, right? So initially, it might feel like slowing down, but this clarity will actually help you speed up the process, ensuring that you're confidently making offers on deals that align with your goals and have a high probability of success.  So in fact, most of our recent clients have actually been making offers on the very first businesses that we put in front of them.  So that's step one in a nutshell. Any questions so far, Athena?

38:32 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  No, sounds good.

38:34 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  Perfect. So step two is going to be really building your deal flow vision, right? So most first-time buyers struggle to see enough volume to find the right business, kind of like we were talking about in our previous conversation, right?  They've been wasting time, searching through listings, trying to get to brokers who never respond or want to speak with them during business hours when they're at work prior to providing any information.  And all that time spent just inside of a business is even worth pursuing, keeps them from moving real viable deals forward.  So they often position themselves well in those first interactions, and then don't move quickly enough to actually secure a deal before it goes under offer, because they have limited time, right?  There's a million other things on your plate. So many also limit themselves geographically, only looking within commuting distance, which severely restricts their chances of success.  The most common belief is that to find a business within two years, you need to be open to the entire U.S., right?  And most people, that's just not feasible. And if they try to do it alone, their chances of success drop dramatically, because their deal flow is significantly limited.  Some buyers attempt to set up their own off-market search, wasting months or even years, trying to figure out how to build a system and actually get responses, verify whether a business is worth pursuing.  And vet owners just for them to waste their time, right? Some buyers attempt to, however, our team knows that how to overcome geographic restrictions and process deals quickly and efficiently to get the information we need to determine if it's a match.  We also source and jump on opportunities that first-time buyers would likely miss, significantly increasing the chances of securing the right business.  Our team does the hard work sourcing, filtering, analyzing businesses, so you get access to a much broader, high-quality deal flow without the inefficiencies of doing this all by yourself, right?  So here's how we ensure you see the right deals. We have 100-plus on-market sources. We tap into dealer networks, private listings, industry-specific deal platforms.  We sign NDAs, actually chase brokers for the SIMs. We'll review that SIM, and as well as the financials, should they be available?  And then if everything looks good, we'll actually speak to the brokers. Our team has a problem. We in the of actually moving deals through our betting funnel quickly and getting through to both brokers to get the info and relationships needed to determine if it will be a good fit.  Direct owner outreach is the second thing we do. contact hundreds of business owners each month to access exclusive off-market deals.  I know that was something important to you, Athena, based on our last conversation, but we really work with them to get an idea of like, hey, what's your profit?  Do you actually have an appetite to sell? And then most importantly, we really want to make sure that their valuation expectations are based in reality and they're actually ready to sell.  So the second thing we do is expert deal filtering. not just throwing thousands of businesses across your desk every month.  We actually sift through those and ensure it will be worth your time. So we only deliver two to four high quality betted deals per month that all have a high probability of being your new.  For your new business, if you will. So the result, you stop wasting time chasing listings, gatekeepers, and dead-end leads.  Instead, you review pre-vetted analysis of high-quality businesses, dramatically improving your chances of finding the right business much faster. In fact, most of our clients are able to get under offer on average within six months.  Any questions on step two so far, Athena?

42:26 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So you said that there's only two to four that I'm going to be seeing per month?

42:31 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  Correct.

42:35 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  That doesn't feel like very much.

42:39 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  How many deals are you seeing on a monthly basis right now?

42:43 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Well, I'm looking at like hundreds on the listing sites.

42:48 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  And then of the hundreds that you're looking at, like, how many are you actually signing an NDA on and looking forward for requesting info from, I should say?

42:59 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Maybe like... 20 a month.

43:01 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  Okay, so 20 a month, you're requesting InfoOne, and then how many do you actually receive back?

43:10 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Pretty close to all of them, maybe 15.

43:13 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  Cool. So you'll see about 15 Sims, and then the million-dollar question is, like, how are you evaluating all of those Sims?  Like, are you spending, like, nights and weekends going through and modeling out every single one, or, like, what's your evaluation process after you actually get that Sim to decide, like, hey, does it make sense to press the broker for a seller conversation?  But I guess just give me a feel for what that process looks like post-SIM.

43:44 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, I'll usually, like, review the Sim, and most of them are really bad, so I'll eliminate them. And then I'll, like, put it into a financial model, and if it doesn't work, based on their asking price, I won't get in touch.

44:00 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  So maybe I'm speaking to a couple brokers a month. So you're saying like, after you receive those 15 SIMs, then you're moving into maybe two broker conversations following that.  And I guess like, on the SIM component, like, are you reading between the lines, I suppose, or understanding like, some of the things that that broker may have missed in that evaluation process?  And maybe like, how much time are you evaluating deals that like, just don't make sense to move on?

44:34 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  I mean, most of them are bad.

44:38 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  So most of them are bad. How do you define bad, I suppose?

44:44 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Well, like the financials look weird, or there's just enough information in the SIM, or there's owner dependency. Client concentration.  Client concentration.

45:00 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, that makes sense. And one thing I'll say, Athena, is like, brokers, we love them, they have a place in the industry, they're really good at what they do, but they tend to not be marketers, if you will.  Right? So like a lot of the things that you're describing to me in the sense of like, the SIM sucked, the financials look wonky, right?  It's like we're, we're not in, like, I guess, like startup world where they have venture-backed funding and investors that they have to report to.  So everything's like, ironed out, picture perfect when it comes to their, their financials, right? So the reason that you're only seeing two to four on a monthly basis is, you mentioned you're having two broker conversations, there's probably another, at least two to five viable candidates in those 20 SIMs that you're receiving on a monthly basis.  But like, you're one individual, you're working a full time job, like you're investing a ton of time into this already.  But like, the reality of like, Being able to pick up the phone, have a conversation with every single one of those brokers, and understand like, hey, what's maybe not listed in the sim that presents a unique opportunity for us that a lot of independent searchers like yourself is going to miss on their own?  Does that make sense?

46:16 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, yeah, I guess that makes sense.

46:18 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  So if I had like, four highly bettered opportunities where it's like, hey, we know this meet your deal box, we've gotten to know you in that first step of the process of becoming the right buyer and understand, hey, this actually helps her not only realize her financial goals, but realize her monetary goals when it comes to like, really being able to derive meaning from leading that organization.  Like, do you think that would be enough to be able to close on a deal within the next six to 12 months?

46:50 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, if they, you know, were good deals, and they match my deal box.

46:57 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, 100%. And that's honestly what's most important. And then again, like, not just looking at that financial component, but some of the things that we were talking about during our previous conversation around really deriving meaning and making sure that, like, you're able to make a real impact in your community and into those around you, right?  So any final questions or any other points you want to make on that prior to hop into step three here, Athena?

47:22 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, no, that sounds good.

47:25 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  Perfect. So the third thing is we're going to calibrate your search and skills, right? So this actually bridges nicely from what we were just talking about.  So many buyers think they know what they want, but your initial deal box, it's just a theory, right? And the biggest problem is, and you said this yourself, like, you don't have enough real experience to truly understand what you want and get taken seriously, right?  And they use private, a lot of folks will use private equity criteria. I know you have a background in investment banking, but really just don't apply to small business acquisitions, talking through the finance.  That you just mentioned, right? Which really makes them sound like inexperienced first time to just don't get taken seriously by brokers, despite being the best owner for that business like yourself, right?  They don't know how to have the right conversations or how to effectively really build rapport and confidence with brokers and owners, and can often be eliminated as a potential buyer ghosted without realizing, hey, there's actually something on my side that led to this, right?  They assume that sims tell the full story when in reality, like they often don't. Many buyers eliminate opportunities based on assumptions rather than having conversations that could uncover hidden gems.  And again, it's likely due to bandwidth. Like you can't be everywhere all the time. So having a team behind you is extremely important in terms of being able to fill that gap.  So instead of making bad decisions, or bad assumptions, rather, we test and refine your criteria through engaging with active deals in your  Deal box and relationship building strategy, right? So we engage with deals in real time. We put real businesses in front of you to help you go out, check, and refine that deal box criteria, especially on areas you weren't sure of to help you and our team just get a sharper image of what the right deal will look like for you.  We'll also start having broker and owner conversations. We ensure you get your reps in having real conversations with brokers and owners.  It sounds like you've had a few on the broker side. We'd love to maybe progress those a bit further.  We're actually talking to the owners as well. And this is a critical skill. you do find the right business, you'll have the confidence and rapport building ability to navigate negotiations effectively and get seen as the right buyer for your ideal deal business.  We'll also help you through negotiations. We teach you what conversations to have at various points in your deal, working with you every step of the way to make you as effective.  facingusz the niceiken. Okay. And ultimately successful in getting chosen as the ultimate buyer of that organization. The result, you end up developing a trained eye, refine your strategy in real time, and become a highly competent buyer in a fraction of the time, only talking to two brokers on a monthly basis, right?  So when you actually find the right deal, you'll know it. And you'll know what to do. In fact, our clients who've closed or gone under offer credit much of their success to this calibration period as they initially underestimated its importance, right?  So that's step three in a nutshell. Questions, thoughts?

50:42 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  No, that makes sense.

50:44 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  Beautiful. So we're ready to move on to step four?

50:46 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, let's go.

50:48 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  Perfect. Well, the final step is obviously making that winning offer. And again, the reason that Athena really started this business is most buyers rough into making offers.  Without the right knowledge, leading to unfundable LOIs, the bank rejects financing just due to poor structure, overpaying or putting themselves at a disadvantage.  So buyers might miss critical inclusions, meaning they overpay or worse, don't have enough liquidity to keep the business stable after acquiring and risk bankruptcy.  Excuse me. They're not winning deals because they don't know how to structure the deal competitively while still protecting themselves.  And deals end up falling apart in due diligence because they didn't negotiate properly up front. So instead, we reverse engineer the offer process.  We show you how to analyze the deals through cash flow, risks, and upsides before you commit. We'll do a pre-lender review.  We coach you on how to verify the deal is fundable before ever sending an LOI. We'll actually help you with structuring for protection as well.  We teach you how to use advanced deal terms like... Forgivable seller notes, working capital adjustments to really minimize your risk and maximize your position while still staying compliant within those SBA guidelines.  Many first-time buyers unknowingly apply private equity deal structures that really just don't meet SBA requirements, which can cause an issue when it comes to actually getting that deal financed down the road.  So, for example, one of our clients built in a 38% forgivable note to account for a client concentration, really improving deal terms and reducing risk on their behalf.  So, finally, we're going to help you with that negotiation piece. We strategize with you on how to negotiate the various points to include in your LOI so that you not only protect yourself, but get a solid deal and get a buy-in from the seller and broker, making less of a chance that the deal falls apart further down the line.  So, the results, you'll submit an offer, submit offer. That are fundable, competitive, and strategically structured to protect your downside and strategically negotiated to ensure you're in a strong position for deal with diligence.  So in fact, one of our clients who closed last year was able to nearly triple their buying power through strategic deal structuring and financing thanks to our guidance.  And you can actually see that testimonial right on our website as well, Athena. So that's step four. How's all that sounding to you?  Any questions so far?

53:28 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Do you guys do the negotiations or how does that work?

53:34 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  No. So we like to think of this a bit in two components, right? So we're a search and match firm.  Our idea or our focus is getting you highly vetted pre-qualified opportunities directly to your inbox on a monthly basis, right?  So that's more of that done for you component, Athena. And then once we get later in those stages where we're actually ready to submit an LOI, that's more of a done with.  You component, right? It's like, we're not brokers. It's crazy. In 22 states, you actually need a real estate license.  How that makes sense? I'll never know, but to sell businesses. So that would be typically what a broker would do with you or do for you, I should say.  So we're here to advise, provide you with the feedback and details that you need to make compelling offers. But ultimately, we're going to want to be in the weeds, having those conversations with brokers as well as sellers.  We're here to support you every step of the way.

54:32 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Does that make sense? Yeah, it does. That's great.

54:35 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  Perfect. So we'll move on to step five here. Obviously, we want to close on your ideal business. Like we're putting deal flow in front of you is great.  But at the end of the day, like, we are here to get deals done. So did you know that 20 to 50% of accepted offers that don't close actually fail because the buyer doesn't know how to navigate the process?  Right? why? It's a lack of buyer readiness. They don't understand. How to properly conduct due diligence is a big one and often get overwhelmed.  They struggle with negotiating which deal adjustments are necessary versus deal breakers. They fail to coordinate legal financing and transition planning efficiently.  They pay their deal teams too early. I can't tell you how many times we've seen somebody bring in a lawyer and you're like, why?  Not yet, not yet, right? So they end up wasting money before confirming if the deal is viable. And so instead, we provide a step-by-step closing roadmap and hands-on guidance to ensure success.  So the structured due diligence, we help you identify and resolve issues without killing a deal. We'll help you with legal and financing coordination and really guide you on how to keep all parties on track to avoid costly delays.  We'll help you with closing cost management as well. We guide you on when to actually engage paid experts so you don't end up burning cash on deals that were never going to close, right?  So So The result, you end up avoiding costly mistakes, close faster, and step into ownership fully prepared instead of scrambling at the last minute to get everything you need done, right?  So any questions on that?

56:11 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  No, that makes sense.

  Perfect. So we'll move on to the delivery component. Like, how are we actually executing on this process, right? So when you work with us, you're not just getting advice, as I mentioned.  You're getting a complete, structured, proven system that removes the guesswork and gives you a clear path to success. So the first thing we're going to do is spend a couple of months on onboarding and building that buyer profile.  We start with an in-depth onboarding session to really clarify your goals and create that buyer profile so we focus only on businesses that fit you specifically, right?  Everyone has more or less the same deal box, but you're not all the same people. So we want to take that into account as we're going through this.  So we'll have you fill out a comprehensive business characteristics questionnaire. And do a call with our team to actually clarify your desires and make suggestions to finalize that deal box.  We provide you with a deal flow CRM as well as our resource platform, including templates for financial modeling. Due diligence is a phenomenal one with all of previous buyer club meetings.  You're able to learn from your peers as well and a whole lot more than that. So the next component is like the deal flow portion, right?  So we're focused on sourcing and vetting. And then we do the heavy lifting, reaching out to literally hundreds of business owners on a monthly basis and review thousands of on-market opportunities to vet real deals that make sense for you.  We also give you video and call access. We provide video walkthroughs for every deal, plus broker and owner call recordings when available for deeper insights.  Curated deal flow, we're going to each... This we present you two to four vetted business opportunities, as I mentioned.  So you'll only spend time on high-quality deals. The opportunities we've only sought for you will never put you in competition with another one of our clients.  And then finally, and arguably most importantly, is that expert deal analysis. Every deal comes with a detailed write-up, including why we like this business for you specifically, what the cash flow looks like post-debt service, what the growth potential is, what sort of risks that you should look out for, and we'll also provide expert insights in terms of what we're seeing in the market.  The fourth is ongoing guidance and expert support, right? We want to be here for the long term, so we provide personalized consulting, one-on-one strategy calls with the team to keep you on track.  We give you access to our Buyers Club. It's joined twice-weekly group calls with experts and other buyers for collaborative learning and insights.  We offer real-time support. Get direct access to our team via Slack channel, via Slack for instant feedback and expert guidance, and then strategy and actionable next steps, right?  You'll always know your next move with clear strategy guidance on every opportunity, from building rapport to the financial structure, to your deal, to negotiating.  We'll show you how to win. Finally, you get to leverage our network to help you win, right? The network we built over a ton of time.  We provide vetted financing options. We introduce you to lenders offering preferential terms for first-time buyers, right? You get access to our trusted deal team and network, our network of lawyers, due diligence experts, and financial advisors to ensure a smooth closing, and then equity injection advance.  The best part about our fee and how we're structured is it can be used as an equity injection to reduce your out-of-pocket costs when it comes time to close.  So, with us, we'll move forward with clarity, confidence, and a team that has your back every step of the way.  So, it's all this. Is this making sense so far, Athena, or questions here?

1:00:04 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, I think it makes sense.

1:00:07 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  Perfect. So at this point, you've seen how we help buyers avoid costly mistakes, dramatically increase deal flow, right, and guide them every step of the way to ensure they close on the right business.  Buying a business is obviously complex, and the reason our process works is simple. Most first-time buyers, they just don't know what they don't know and end up spinning their wheels, wasting time, and miss out on great opportunities, right?  But with us, that doesn't happen. We dramatically increase your deal flow and sourcing power. We guide you through every stage from search to close with expert support.  We help you figure out what type of businesses would be a great fit for you, one that aligns with your goals and can truly change your life.  And we ensure that you make informed, fundable offers with the highest chance of success. So we're definitely there to support you through that LOI process.  Our clients consistently tell us that without... Without our guidance, they wouldn't have been able to navigate this process anywhere near as effectively.  So if you want to stop spinning your wheels, avoid wasted time and money, and confidently acquire the right business, we'd love to help.  So is this sounding like the type of support that you're looking for, Athena?

1:01:18 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, I think so.

1:01:21 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  And just curious, but in terms of the process specifically, like how we actually execute, like how do you feel?

1:01:29 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, I think it sounds good. I don't know if I need the advice, but I do need deal flow.

1:01:37 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  What about the advice component you feel like is maybe not as relevant to you, Athena?

1:01:44 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  I just, you know, I already have my deal team set up and I'm in communities and stuff. So I think I know how that all is going to work.

1:01:53 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, that makes sense. And who have you sourced from your deal or for your deal team so far, I should say, Athena, like you have...  An intermediary you're working with? What about an attorney, an accountant, those sort of things?

1:02:06 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, I've got an attorney and QOV that I know I want to work with when I find a deal.

1:02:14 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  Cool. And do you have a good pulse on when to bring them in in that process? For instance, when would you engage your accountant for a QOV?  And then when would you bring in your attorney? Do you have a good pulse on, I guess, maybe let me make that a bit more open-ended.  When are you thinking about engaging them within this process?

1:02:36 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Well, when I signed the LOI.

1:02:41 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  Okay. So you're going to bring in both the accountant and the attorney post-LOI?

1:02:48 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah.

1:02:49 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  Cool. And you had a pre-approval letter through LiveOak, correct?

1:02:54 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah.

1:02:55 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  Yeah. And are you thinking that you'd want to do QOV prior to having... Letting the bank do a first pass in terms of underwriting.

1:03:05 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  I guess I hadn't thought about it.

1:03:08 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, I mean, big sense. Like, you're really at the beginning of this journey. And, like, this is what we're talking about in terms of, like, wasted fees or bringing in vendors too early, right?  It's like, no doubt, like, with or without my help, like, you strike me, Athena, as, like, someone that's going to get this done.  But at the end of the day, like, I'll tell you right now, and this is just one you can take with you, like, if you're engaging QOV prior to having a lender do a first pass and see if this is even a financeable deal, like, most SBA lenders and LIBO specifically, who I know you have that QO or a qualification letter from, doesn't require QOV on most opportunities.  Is it a good idea to have before you sign on the dotted line and move forward? Absolutely, but, like, I would highly encourage you to at least have the bank do a portion of that work on your behalf.  They're not... I'm not going to charge you for it. And then if it's a really viable opportunity that you want to move forward with, okay, let's bring in a QOB provider and have them start that process.  If everything checks out via QOB, then we can have the attorney actually hop in and put that final offer letter on your behalf.  But it's extremely important from a finance perspective to do things in the right order to really limit out-of-pocket expenses for you up front.  Does that make sense?

1:04:31 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah.

1:04:32 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  Cool. So definitely appreciate your honesty with me. And let me be clear about something crucial here. The thing that's most important to us, Athena, is really alignment.  And when you come on board, we're not just providing services. We're truly entering a partnership. We've spent years building relationships with lenders, deal teams, owners, and brokers.  When we take one as a client, we're vouching for you to... All of these connections. We're saying, this person is serious about buying a business and actually moving forward like you're in that 2%.  And if things don't work out, it's not just your time at stake. It's really our reputation and relationships on the line that have taken us a long time to build.  So that's why I need to be absolutely certain you're ready for this journey. When we commit to a client, we provide thorough deal analysis, leverage our extensive network, and offer dedicated support throughout the process.  But for us to invest all of that, we need to know like, hey, you're serious and ready to take action when the right opportunity presents itself.  So just to be 100% clear, like on a scale from 1 to 10, 1 being this won't help me at all, 10 being this is exactly when I need to acquire a business.

1:05:45 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Like where do you feel like you fall? Maybe like a 7 or an 8.

1:05:51 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  I gotcha. Well, definitely appreciate you being honest. It's like, what would make you a 8, 9 or 10?

1:05:59 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Well, I don't give anything. A 10, and I still don't know what the costs are, so it's kind of hard to make a decision.

1:06:06 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, it makes sense. And I guess fees aside, if you're not going to give everyone a 10, or anybody a 10, I should say, completely understand that.  But to get to that 8 or 9, cost aside, what would it take?

1:06:22 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, if the costs work, I think I'm at an 8 or a 9.

1:06:29 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  So the cost portion makes sense. It's something that you think will help you and will actually get you to the end result that you're looking for, which isn't simply buying a business, Athena.  It's making sure that it aligns with who you are and what your goals are long-term. So if we can make the upfront commitment or the commitment make sense for you, it sounds like this is something that you're ready to move forward with quickly.

1:06:59 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, I think so.

1:07:01 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  Perfect. So I feel good. What's next steps? Like, where do you want to go from here? Is it just the brass tax question, the million-dollar question, if you will?

1:07:12 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, I would love to know the cost.

1:07:17 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  Perfect. So I'll walk you through kind of what it looks like from an onboarding perspective. So the first thing I'll do is send you over the agreement.  You'd pay or sign and pay that. We'll schedule a two-deep dive, two-hour sessions. We'll get to know you, define your goals, and craft your ideal deal box.  Think of it as programming your GPS. The clearer the destination, the better the route we can map out. You'll also complete a business characteristics questionnaire to outline your preferences.  And our second session, we'll go through it together to fine-tune that strategy and help you understand how your deal flow may be impacted based on some of those restrictions.  So once those sessions will wrap up, we'll give you access to Aquamatch's Buyer's Club meeting. Giving you a chance to learn from others, please see our methodology in action and upskill while your search really gears up.  the same time, we'll go out, initiate the SBA approval process. It sounds like something you've already done on your side.  We just want to understand where you're at a bit further and see if we could potentially raise that initial commitment above that 1.5 that you mentioned, just because it's going to make you more attractive to brokers as well as sellers.  And then we'll set you up with a personal dashboard. This is really your command center where you'll track deals, access resources, and monitor progress.  And lastly, we'll assign you some getting deal-ready homework, practical exercises, really designed to prepare you for what's ahead. So from analyzing financials to really sharpening that seller pitch.  And then finally, we'll finalize your deal box and buyer profile. And you'll review it and approve these. are the foundation of our search.  So we want them to be a spot on. So by the time, by the end of onboarding, you'll be primed and ready to dive into the search process with us by your side, every single step of the way.  So sound good. Any questions on that component? We'll move into the investment piece.

1:09:19 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yep, sounds good.

1:09:20 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  Perfect. So the search investment, the four things we want to make sure of is like transparent pricing. We believe in bringing up front about our fees.  So hidden costs of price charges down the line. What we discussed today is what you'll pay, period. We want you to have a clear understanding of the investment from the very beginning.  The second is like a straightforward success fee. Our fee is structured, is designed to be simple, easy to understand.  We don't do complicated calculations or variable rates or anything like that. Our success fee is a flat amount. And this means whether you buy a business for $1 million or $5 million, our fee remains.  It's exactly the same. And then we want to make sure our interests are aligned. Our fee structure is designed to ensure that we can support you with the best possible service without having to rush through the process.  So again, some brokers, and this is changing very rapidly, but have traditionally operated on a success fee-only model where they're tempted to push deals quickly or go out and find something that's the largest deal that you can afford because they're paid on a percentage basis.  And then the final is the ability to include these fees either in the low as working capital that you're able to use towards the business or in more commonly as a prepayment toward the equity injection up front.  So even in worst case scenario where a lender doesn't view it this way, again, you can always work that into working capital.  We're able to use that towards growing and scaling the organization. So we set things up this way because we want you to feel confident and comfortable throughout this process.  And our goal is to remove as many barriers as possible between you and successful business ownerships. So does this approach make sense?  Any questions on how we operate before we get into the specifics?

1:11:19 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  No, that makes sense.

1:11:21 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  Perfect. So the investment's $100K for business. It doesn't matter if you're, again, if you're buying a $1 million business or a $5 million business, and really that investment gets you to business ownership in 12 months or less, typically, is what we see.  So we start with $70K in terms of upfront. This covers your full onboarding process in the first six months of search.  If that search does run longer than six months, we include an additional six months completely complimentary. So what happens at the end is once you sign.  That final purchase agreement, then we do ask for an additional $30k as a success fee or as a, I'm doing a terrible job explaining pricing, Athena.
  ACTION ITEM: Rewrite pricing/fee structure explanation in sales script
 - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/288187693?timestamp=4323.9999  That was something else that I wanted to work out today.

1:12:17 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah. Cool. Cool. Um, I think have a go at rewriting like the script on the, like how our fees are structured and then this part and run it, like send it over to me because we need to update it based on the, um, changes in the SOP.  Yeah. Do you feel like you got a good handle on all that to be able to have a go at rewriting that portion of the script?

1:12:44 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, I can make first pass for sure. And then you're going to want to make some adjustments for sure.

1:12:48 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  But yeah, I can make first pass. Absolutely. Yeah. And also I've been like, a lot of people don't even know about other advisors or how they're compensated or that sort of thing.  So I think I usually say. It's not in the script, but I'm like, I don't understand buy-side advisors that charge a percentage of the deal when I'm trying to get you the best price, right?  So I usually say things in that part that's not in the script, but it's ultimately like somebody that's charging you a percentage of the deal cost wants you to buy the biggest business possible, or they might treat clients differently based on their spending power, so we don't do that.

1:13:26 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, that's helpful. That's a more simplified approach to that.
  ACTION ITEM: Record voice note w/ feedback on Austin's presentation
 - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/288187693?timestamp=4409.9999

1:13:30 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, I think you did a great job on everything else. I have little points and some things that I'm seeing that I need to update in the script.  I'll send like a voice note today with that feedback, so I can give you that before tomorrow. I guess the only thing I'm thinking about is the beginning, right?  So if you're pivoting the intro to say, we're going to go away and talk about this and decide whether you'd be a good fit.  Definitely. the guest. I'm Let's What I used to do was address the concerns before I went into the pitch.  I removed that because it was just making it really long, but I think there's a reason to bring that back now to get them selling you on why they're a good fit before you even get into the pitch part.
  ACTION ITEM: Add initial client fit assessment section back into sales script
 - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/288187693?timestamp=4448.9999

1:14:19 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, because I was using, I think, the older version of the script and not going through and making that modification, and I was like, where did that go?  Because I like the gut check up front, for lack of a better expression.

1:14:33 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, you're actually on the newest version of the script. just removed that part because it was taking me a really long time to get through everything.  But if you want to add that back in and just have me review how you're positioning it and stuff, but since we're saying we need to go back and talk to the team, and then with Morgan, it's like, hey, team all feels you'd be a great business owner.  A great client. Our concerns are X, Y, Z. You know, let's talk through that because I'm not going to put you through a pitch if you're not a good fit.

1:15:10 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  I agree. I, yeah, I'll make some modifications today, Athena, and just send it over to you and then give me your feedback on that.

1:15:18 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  We can pick it up from there. Yeah, I mean, it was great. I think if you run it through a few more, the only, you know, the major thing is just you getting comfortable reading the script, you know, and trying to make it feel like it's free flowing rather than reading from a script, but that just takes practice.  So, and then there's little things here and there. So if you could get the PowerPoint also set up, because there's just a lot of, like, pixelated images and stuff, and from a branding thing, I'm like, ah, and the video also isn't going to play in your Google Slides.
  ACTION ITEM: Create screen share video showing PowerPoint setup process
 - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/288187693?timestamp=4552.9999

1:15:51 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, and that's, like, not the proper deck either. As soon as we hop off this call, Athena, like, that's the very next thing I'm focused on.  Well, then, I See, I've got a couple of messages from Anka as well, so we'll figure it Cool.

1:16:03 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  And then I'll say Kate's name, because they search the notes so they know what the follow-up are. So I need to get you a voice note with my feedback from this and also see if I can do a screen share to show you how I set up the screen with everything and what I do so that you can see how I do that to get it full screen for PowerPoint.

1:16:25 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, perfect.

1:16:26 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Awesome. But great. This is awesome. I feel comfortable. I think Shauna's going be a great one to start with.   getting blood from a stone. But I like what you did. I don't do that enough. Oh, you know, in what order are you going to do things?  When I think of sales calls, I'll assess and diagnose, but I won't treat. I won't give them the medicine, you know, so like telling them what to do.  best you. to do. It's kind of giving away how we would do it, rather than saying, like, I can tell from what you're telling me that you're probably going to end up being one of those people that wastes money, because it's not the order that we would potentially have you do it in, rather than telling her how to do it.  Because then it's like, you've just given her kind of some of the secret sauce in terms of what to do there.

1:17:23 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  That's fair. Yeah, I'm like, I'm good with that. I'm good with that.

1:17:28 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So, like, you can, you can cut, like, the line of questioning was perfect. But then it's like, okay, so you're, you're, you've got the right people, but when to engage them and how to save money, it's clear you don't have that nailed down.  And that's part of the thing that we do. And it's going to be different with every single deal. We're going to walk you through where you're at, what you need to do in order to save yourself money and validate it's still a viable deal for you.

1:17:54 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, that makes perfect sense.

1:17:56 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Cool. Great, though. I'm really happy. And you're good on the intro calls later.

1:18:01 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, yeah. And I'll give you space to speak today.

1:18:05 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah. say a little hello, maybe real quick.

1:18:10 - Austin Lortie (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, I appreciate it.

1:18:11 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Good luck on your client call, and I will see you in a few hours. Okay, sounds great. Thanks, Austin.  Great work. Bye, Athena. Bye.
