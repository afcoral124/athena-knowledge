[00:00:00] 



**Athena:** Happy New Year! Same 

**Joe:** to you! 

**Athena:** Awesome! Hey Polly, Happy New Year! Happy New Year to you! I'm loving that bright blue. It's a good color. Thank you! Awesome. I think I heard Gil too. I don't know if I'm seeing you. 

**Joe:** Yeah, I'm here. Hello. Happy New Year. 

**Athena:** Hi Gil. Welcome to the Buyer's Club.

Gil is a new client that's joining. Um, so great to see you all and I'm excited to have some conversations today. So we've got a few little kind of updates and conversations. Hey Steve, Happy New Year. 

**Steve:** Happy new everybody, 

**Athena:** um, just a few updates and conversations and then also there's going to be lots of time to talk through challenges.

Uh, any, any things that, um, you know, you want questions or want feedback from me or the team about, um, also want to check in and just see, you know. If any of you were [00:01:00] able to go through that sending the destination exercise, and if anything came out there, that was interesting for you, but this is kind of open for you today to be able to ask questions, talk through challenges that you're having with the deals.

Or, you know, we can pull up some models and work through some things too. If there's any particular areas that you want to zone in on. But before we get to that, um, wanted to have Luke give you all a little industry update. So there's things that happen in this industry that you may or may not hear about, but we want to make sure that we're giving you that information and you know what it means for you.

So, um, there are often what is called SOP guideline changes that the SBA makes, which is how they kind of govern all of the banks. That do lending under the SBA program. So all of those banks are not the SBA. They just use the SBA program in which to lend. And so each bank interprets these, this SOP, [00:02:00] these guidelines from the SBA in different ways, but when the SBA makes changes to the SBA.

S. O. P. then it means a standard operating procedure. Then it means that banks can make those adjustments in terms of the restrictions and how they lent. So there was a pretty big S. O. P. change that happened right before the holidays and it opens up some cool possibilities for you all. So I want to hand over to Luke because he's been doing a lot of research on this and he wants to give you the update on what happened and what it means for you all.

And then we'll open it up for questions and discussions. If, if you want any further clarity on what Luke's about to share. So Luke over to you. 

**Luke:** Yeah, so happy new year, everyone. And we just wanted to give you a quick, uh, industry update on something that changed a new rule that could be beneficial for you when considering deal structuring, when you close on a business.

So effective December 6th, last month, the SBA is now allowing rollover equity to be used in asset acquisitions. This will allow sellers to retain equity through a [00:03:00] new entity for Formed by the buyer. Now, before this rule change, you could only use rollover equity and a stock sale, not an asset sale. So I'm sure Athena and Ryan have talked to you guys about this, but the difference between an asset and a stock transaction is in an asset transaction.

The buyer, you buy an existing company's assets, their real estate equipment, contracts, intellectual property, et cetera. And basically the old company kind of gets deleted and just doesn't exist anymore. And you form a new entity that takes over all of those assets. In a stock deal, it's very simple. You just purchase that old company.

No new entity is formed. It's a more simple transaction. And like I said, as Athena and Ryan have probably told you, you want to do an asset deal instead of a stock deal because asset deals offer better liability protection and more favorable tax treatment. So now you can use this rollover equity in an asset sale instead of a stock sale and get the benefits that come with an asset transaction.

So some benefits on why you may want to use rollover equity in your transaction. It's kind of similar to why we like to see seller notes in deals. [00:04:00] First benefit is that the seller is more invested in the future success of your company because they have an ownership stake in that company now. So it will help them, you know, act better maybe when they're helping train you for the company and really put more into the business.

Second, it can help you increase your purchasing power. So just to keep the numbers really simple, let's say your max purchasing power to buy a business was 1 million. If you didn't use any rollover equity, you could only afford a 1 million business. But if you got say 10 percent rollover equity, since you're only paying for 90 percent of the business, now you can afford a 1.

1 million business. And you can just do the mental math in your head from there. If you say max purchasing power, 5 million, And you got 10 percent rollover equity again. Now you can afford a 5. 5 million business. And third, a benefit is for rollover equity with companies where you need licensing requirements.

For example, if you're buying a plumbing company and you need a master plumbers license on the business, you could have the previous owner. Retain some equity and then their master's plumbing license would still be with the [00:05:00] company and now you don't have to worry about getting the license for yourself or hiring someone with the license and since this is a new rule change, you know, there's not much transaction or legal precedent for how it will go properly.

So you want to make sure that you talk with your lender that they're, they're adopting this new rule and that you're doing it the right way. Cause as Athena mentioned, SBA lenders vary in how they do things. And you'll also want to talk with your lawyer to make sure that your transaction structure complies with this new rule to just make sure that you're doing everything properly.

So that's just a short industry update that could hopefully be beneficial for you guys when you're considering deal structuring.

**Athena:** Awesome, Luke. Such a cool opportunity for you all. So I just want to check in, like, did that land, did that make sense? Any questions about what this new SOP means or what it means for you all when you're looking at opportunities? Um, there's no, no bad questions here because the SBA and the guidelines and everything kind of are, uh, you know.

Head spinner, [00:06:00] so here's an opportunity to kind of dig in and have a discussion. If if that made sense, I think Luke did a great job at explaining it. But again, just understanding the nuances between stock and asset sale. That itself can take a while to kind of figure out. So how did that come through? Did that make sense anyone working on some deals right now?

Or that might even be an opportunity or something that they've looked on in the past.

**Joe:** Yeah, this is Joe. I'm trying to think through what that would mean for me or in general. I'm still trying to, and sorry, I just parked. Uh, so I was driving for a minute. Um, what am I rolling over equity from 

**Athena:** so it would be. So, in the past, when you want to leave the owner with equity in the business. And use an SBA loan, then the only way the SBA allowed that was through a stock sale.

So the SBA basically limited [00:07:00] your options. Yeah, you weren't allowed to do. Yeah, you weren't allowed to do an asset sale and leave the owner with equity. Under SBA guidelines. So the reason why they wanted to change the SOP because they're like, hang on, you're severely restricting all the deals that can be done because it's not, it's not to the buyer's advantage on any means you're inheriting the liability.

And as you're seeing with the, the modeling that you're doing, it has a material difference when you're doing a stock sale versus an asset sale in terms of the tax advantages to you. So when the SBA was like, well, if you want to leave the owner with any equity, You have to do a stock sale. So it was putting people using SBA at a disadvantage compared to private equity where they could, they always do roll over equity.

Right. But they, they're fully funding the deal usually internally without taking any debt or they take on private debt where it's not an issue.[00:08:00] 

Does that make sense? 

**Joe:** Yep, thanks. 

**Athena:** Yeah, so it's a cool opportunity, especially with, uh, you know, like Ryan mentioned businesses where there are licensing requirements in order to be in, you know, owning, like, an HVAC business or a plumbing business, or some of these businesses, it's state by state dependent on what the requirement is, but for some of them in order to own, say, like, a plumbing business in certain states, it's You have to have 1 of the owners have a master plumbing license.

Um, so we see this often where, you know, the owner is willing to, like, lease their license to the business and usually the best way to do that is just leave them with some equity in the deal to be able to do that now. Um, Luke just recently came across a great episode. Of acquiring minds. One of our favorite resources where you want to be really conscious of giving equity in your [00:09:00] business.

Luke, do you want to give a quick synopsis of that one? And then maybe we can share the episode link and buyers club too. For anybody that's looking at bringing on someone, uh, and giving them equity in your business, it's, it can be a really great tool, but not without like, Potential for lots of issues, you know, um, Luke just just filled Luke filled us in regularly.

He does our industry updates and filled us in on it as a team on this episode. That was pretty horrific by the sounds of things, but a good warning as to the ways not to do a partnership agreement. 

**Luke:** Yeah, so I think another point that athena is trying to get at was this one specific situation So there's this guy searching to buy a business like you guys But and he found this plumbing business that he wanted to buy But he needed a master's plumbing license and he wanted to more just focus on the business, right?

Managing the business running [00:10:00] sales and and and doing more the business work not necessarily the plumbing work So he met this guy at his church that had a master plumbing license And they agreed to go into a partnership to buy this new company. And what happened was, um, this guy, the plumber from the church, he was not willing to budge on giving up any less than 50 percent equity.

It had to be 50 50. So the searcher, the businessman who wanted to really own and run the business, he wouldn't have a controlling ownership stake in the business. And that really screwed him over in the future because this, Plumber that he did. The partnership was actually a really bad guy and did business very poorly and ruined their business.

He ended up, uh, the searcher, he ended up going into bankruptcy actually. So it was a very, uh, cautious warning of what not to do when entering into a partnership. 

**Athena:** Yeah, one of those harrowing stories that, like, it doesn't, you know, it, I, I'd rather, you know, the worst case scenario. And when it comes to partnership, I don't think I've been very quiet, you know, with any of you [00:11:00] and kind of publicly, like, I'm not a fan of giving equity.

In in a business most of the time. So there are situations like where the previous owner has a license and they're going to be silent and you know, you leave them some rollover equity and or you need them to be invested in the business for the next couple of years. But even then. You know, I prefer a profit sharing incentive over equity, like giving ownership of the business should only be done under certain circumstances.

And Luke and I were talking about this where, you know, to me, it's, it's common sense, never ever to give controlling interest or a majority equity stake, or even equity stakes to multiple people where it puts you as the minority owner, unless you've like really thought that through. And it's not necessarily common knowledge to most people because I've been in the startup world for like, you know, over a decade, 2 decades now, and I've seen those things go wrong so many times.

So, um, you know, [00:12:00] it can be a very strong tool to bring in owners or partners into your business, incentivize them with a little bit of equity. However, it should not be without a lot of consideration and consult consultation. And, you know, as you all know, if you're considering anything like that as part of your deal, I'd hope you come to us and talk through the pluses and minuses, you know, in startup land, we see this when people are like, well, I don't have a lot of money.

So I'll give someone equity or I'll, I'll do a 50 50 split with them, you know, and, and they're not thinking of like, well, we probably have different, you know, Work ethics and ideas of how many hours that we want to work and, you know, just all of those discussion points that don't happen in advance that should happen in advance.

And you realize, like, well, we have very different views of, like, what being an owner in this business means. So doing a 50 50 split is probably 1 of the worst things you could ever do. So. Yeah, um, and then, uh, Steve, I saw your message about reading about the SOP guidelines. Luke has some [00:13:00] notes and then Luke, maybe you can actually share the link to the.

SOP itself, if if anybody wants to read further on it. 

**Luke:** Yeah, I have little notes that I wrote down from what I talked about. We'll have probably Anka include that in the in the documents that we send at the end of every buyers club meeting. 

**Athena:** Yeah, and then the source of the asset, like where you got the SOP or where if they want to.

So Steve, the SOP itself is like. Um, you, you need to be a lawyer most of the time to interpret it because they just write it in the most weird convoluted language. So, um, some folks I love, uh, listening to on linked in is, uh, the SMB law group, Kevin Henderson, in particular, he's been doing a lot of great dialogue and SOP guidelines.

Um, but, yeah, we'll make sure that we get a link. Uh, to the summary and then the SOP itself, if you want to read through it, um, into the buyer's club channel. [00:14:00] Thanks, Luke. Anyone have any questions about partnership or like where or when you would consider it in, in a business acquisition or even, even experiences to share about partnership?

I know I, I have definitely made the wrong decision in a previous business around partnership. Steve, you want to share something? 

**Steve:** No, I have a question. Yeah, go for it. Uh, just from, you know, do you have any guidelines, experiences around? So I understand, Hey, you'd never want a 50 50 or, you know, giving up majority, um, ownership is, is, uh, not a great idea.

That said, sometimes I've seen at least, um, you know, at least some conversation around, Hey, I'd like to expand, uh, maybe the buying capability. I need a little bit more money, uh, as part of it. So I've seen things like, you know, you put 10 percent cash in. For 15 percent equity, that type of deal, is that something you have experienced with?

Is that a [00:15:00] good idea? A bad idea? I just don't know. 

**Athena:** Yeah. So you mean for investors specifically, like bringing investors into your deal? Yeah. Tons of exposure and experience to this. And, um, in startups, I typically will always recommend to a founder like put off investment as long as humanly possible. And the reason for that is when you're a startup, the investors are looking at risk.

So when investors are looking at deals, they're looking like, what is the potential rate of return that I'm going to get? And also, what is the risk of me actually getting that rate of return? Now, in a startup, a small business, it's unproven. The risk is. Exponentially high and, you know, sophisticated angel investors, sophisticated VCs they know, and the VC model is actually built on investing in like 30, knowing that 1 maybe will hit, you know, so they're expecting a loss there, but then for that investment, they take a ton of [00:16:00] equity to try to like, mitigate the risk.

Now, so I'm always when I'm, when I'm talking to startups, I'm like, don't. Take investment unless you absolutely, like, need it. And it's the only way in this scenario, though. I love it because, um, when you want to go after a larger deal, then you can potentially do yourself. You have now a proven business, something that has a proven track record, where the risk to the investor is choosing the right operator.

So as long, and that's you, when you're like, this is my deal. I just need a little bit of capital in order to be able to do this. Do this deal because I don't have enough liquidity myself. The bank will only lend me 5 million. I need 6 million. So if I get another a hundred K from, and the seller won't budge on, on increasing their note.

Right. So where you're like, this is my business. I am the one to operate this. Like I see the future. I know I'm going to do an absolutely amazing job [00:17:00] at it. Then bringing in someone for, for a little bit of capital to be able to make up that risk when you're using SBA. So like, as an investor. If I'm looking at someone with a strong history that I believe will be a really great owner of this business who's putting a personal guarantee on a loan to be able to buy this business, right?

So that's mitigating my risk because I'm like, I have a proven company. That I can look at their past financials, their past performance. I need to make sure the person I'm choosing to invest in has the capability and experience and appetite to be able to lead this business to at least perform, excuse me, at least perform in the way that it's performed in the past.

And this person is so like, emphatic that they are the one to do it. They're putting a personal guarantee and their whole livelihood on the line to like, that's a great investment, you know? And when we see the rate of return on these types [00:18:00] of deals for somebody giving a little bit of money to help make up the down payment or equity injection requirements, for example, the rate of return in real estate and, you know, there's.

Folks in this community and in the buyers club that are much more sophisticated at real estate, but then I am, but my understanding is the rate of return is, you know, 15 percent if you choose a really good real estate deal, we're seeing a minimum of 30 percent internal rate of return for somebody just putting like, writing a, you know, Equity injection check to somebody, and then we're seeing what's called a step up.

So whatever the amount of ownership, like, say, say, somebody puts in 100, 000 and the business is worth. A million, then, you know, that would be 10 percent of the enterprise value that somebody is putting towards it. But what we often see is, is people putting a step [00:19:00] up applying what's called a step up to that equity.

So they'll say, okay, I'm going to, you know, put a 1. 5 step up, which means you'll get 15 percent equity in this business. So even at 15%. You know, they're a minority owner. They're not going to be able to get you out of the business. Um, you can put a lot of guardrails around that in terms of governance, you know, so they, you know, you ideally put something in, like, you might do for a real estate syndication where they're a limited partner.

They don't have say in the business. Or what's even better is you find somebody who has a lot of amazing experience in the space, connections, like, you know, they know what they're doing. They can be an advisor to you. So then you get someone who's giving you money, who's also personally invested in seeing you be successful, that has the background experience to be able to do that.

That to me is like a win, because what would you have needed to pay to get that person's expertise? And connections [00:20:00] and, and genuinely want to see you do well. So, um, you all know the story of when I was raising 3 million to, to go after the 8 million deal to me, I was like, this is amazing. Like, I'm going to have this whole panel of like amazing people that are going to help me, like, make sure that this is successful when I buy it.

And it was the first time that I, it really clicked for me how investment in this sort of deal, Puts you at the advantage because you have the majority ownership. You have majority governance. There's no threat of you being like thrown out unless you do something like, you know, it would be written into the, um, the, the contracts and stuff that if you like mishandled money or did fraud or stuff like that, then they could, you know, potentially do something, but other than you doing something that you wouldn't do anyway, because you're an integrous person, you, you maintain the ownership into the business.

So. I think it can be a really strong tool, especially when you find one of the bigger ones that you're like, this is [00:21:00] a little bit too much for me to bite off myself. But if I had, you know, somebody getting involved and then on top of that, because the returns are the way they are, there's a lot of investors.

That are coming to this market that want to invest in these types of deals. So that was a long winded answer to your question, but did that answer your question? 

**Steve:** Yeah, and it gave me like four more questions, so 

**Athena:** yeah, go for it. Let's let's hear it. 

**Steve:** No, no, no. So, uh, first of all, when you talk about internal rate of return, um, are you saying 30%?

Are you, are you making any, um, revenue growth assumptions over a period of time for that IRR? Or is that? Pretty much static over the investment time, paying down loans, et cetera. You know what kind of calculation when you're saying you're seeing 30 percent plus out there today? 

**Athena:** Yeah, so good question. In those modeling templates that you all have, it actually does have a section over to the far right.

Um, on bringing in investor capital. So you can actually [00:22:00] mess around with the different metrics to see what happens to the IRR. Um, if you were to, to have investor capital come in, so, um, typically the, the terms for these types of deals that allow for a 30 percent or more IRR is, um, Something that has at least a debt service of the 1.

5. So you can utilize the SBA. And then there's something called a PREF, which is essentially interest that's paid on someone's investment until they get all their money back. So say someone gives you a hundred thousand, you would pay typically between an eight to 12 percent PREF, which is an interest rate on that until they got the full hundred thousand back with interest.

After that point, then it flips to everybody gets distributions, including you. So that is one of the disadvantages of bringing in investor money is you [00:23:00] don't start sharing in the profit distributions until your investors get paid back. So, you know, making sure when you're doing the modeling that it's like, okay, I think I could pay them back within a year or two.

You build in a good salary for yourself and like agree with the investors, any bonuses or anything that you'd be able to take, but you're incentivized then to pay them back as soon as possible. So you're essentially paying an interest between eight to 12 percent on whatever they invested until they get.

The principal it's called, so the original investment back, then it just goes to profit distribution. So they would get in that scenario, 15 percent of the profit distributions. So, in that model, where the, I think, conservatively, if you were doing like a 3 percent growth rate every year, that's where we're seeing, like, 30 percent IRR, but even if it stayed the same, you know, IRR, I've seen some of them where it's like 70%.

Still at like 25% if, if the numbers all stayed the same. Um, I've seen some [00:24:00] as high, some modelings as high as like 60% . So like investors are loving this because it's like as long as you choose the right person to take over that company and the company continues to perform at least as it has been, then it's a pretty solid investment.

**Steve:** So, and I don't have my sheet open, the calculator open, which I should, unfortunately, but I don't want to walk and chew gum at the same time as I'm listening to you. Uh, the other question I have then based on that is when you talk about the step up, is your IRR including the additional equity from the step up, or is that just a bonus on top?

**Athena:** No, yeah, it's all, it all wraps it up into the same package. So, if you increase the step up, then the IRR would be included. So that's, so those are your kind of metrics to play with are, you know, what rate of growth am I assuming investors like to see you do like worst case or no change, you know, like, so that they can see, like, what's the [00:25:00] worst case that I'm looking at for my, like, they don't want you to be like, we're going to get 20 percent growth rate every single year because they know that's not real, at least the sophisticated ones will now, if you're going to friends and family, even more so to like, Conservatively do your numbers so that you're like, hey, this is like, worst case scenario, the capital is at risk, et cetera.

Um, but the, the numbers that you can play with to increase that are, are what kind of growth rate that you're looking at. What kind of free cash flow that you have. So, you know, if you have a healthy debt service number, uh, or debt service coverage ratio, like a 1. 5, then you should have a fair bit amount of free cash flow.

So like what's actually left every year. Um, the other thing, so IRR is calculated by how quickly they get their capital back. So the sooner you can pay their investment back and then they start participating in the profit distributions, the more that increases the internal rate of return. So the longer it takes for [00:26:00] somebody to get that 100, 000 back, then the lower the IRR is, so that's like, it's the time horizon in which they're getting their money back, and then the PREF, so the interest that you pay as well as the step up are kind of the key components that will increase a rate of return.

**Steve:** So another quick question, just off of the whole investor scenario. Um, I mean, from a just a common sense standpoint to me, that would actually raising some not, you know, again, not majority investor money, but raising some investor money to me that that would also lower the cash flow risk to the business as well, since you're not.

Or am I wrong on that 

**Athena:** depends on what the, you know, that's why we like you to look at every business separately and kind of see what's going on there because you might be able to just increase the working capital. Like, if, if the, if you can't agree, a working capital number with the owner, but the numbers still [00:27:00] allow for you to add additional working capital from the bank, then it's a conversation with yourself of do I want to take on the debt and the ownership myself?

You know, um, because if you just increase the working capital requirements, you still own 100 percent of the business, but it might, you know, you'll have a little bit more debt than you would have otherwise investors, especially in the way that, like, if you're using a sophisticated investor, then you're likely going to have to structure as a C corp.

There's a lot of filing requirements. You're going to have a lot more like. People work and things to do on your side. So you also want to make sure the juice is worth the squeeze, you know, so if you could have just gotten an extra a hundred K in working capital from the bank versus now, you're going to have to structure your entity in a certain way.

You're going to have to do quarterly distributions. You're going to have to do reporting. You're going to have to do K ones for your investors and like all these other things that come along with taking investors, then. You know, [00:28:00] my personal preference is like you do it only when you really need it. Um, versus, oh, I, I just want to have a bit more cashflow at the beginning.

It's like, well, are there other opportunities for you to do that? You know, or get the bank to make sure you always want to try to get a line of credit issued at the time you do the loan. Anyway, it's much harder to get it after you've closed on the business and started running it. So just having that line of credit available if you need it.

And then you have total ownership without the headache of having to drop investor agreements and governance and compliance and entity structuring and all that stuff. 

**Steve:** One last question. We're talking about investors. Um, so in your experience, again, Uh, from, you know, I've got my opinion on it, but I just want to know your take as well.

How, how, how often do you look to maybe an investor, not necessarily just for the cash flow, but the opportunity to have the advisory[00:29:00] 

versus just cash flow or just cash? 

**Athena:** I mean, I, in that scenario, like if you're like, I, I literally don't know what I'm doing. I would look to do profit share over equity just in case that advisor doesn't And I saw that a lot of Sharky behavior and startup worlds were like, advisors would convince startups to put them on the cap table and then they just disappear and do nothing.

And then they were just getting equity for it. Right? So, if this is somebody that you have a really. Longstanding relationship with you, you've worked with them before you, you're like, I can't, I literally can't get this anywhere else. And, and I would be so lucky to have them involved. And I know their work ethic.

I know that they'll deliver all of those things. You kind of want to be unquestioning in that if you're not sure. And it's somebody that like, let's say the bank is like, you're taking over, um, uh, [00:30:00] tree. Arborist business, right? And you've never worked in trees before, and you don't necessarily need a license for it, but I am concerned about your ability to do that.

Then then they might like to see you have an advisor with equity that has that kind of experience. So, sometimes, like, the lenders and their risk might dictate that you want to look for someone like that. You know, or if you're like, I don't think I can do this without an advisor that really knows this industry.

But again, looking at doing profit share or rev share, if they're going to be in a sales seat, something else so that if it doesn't work out, you can end the relationship rather than them having equity in your business forever. That's my personal take on it. Now, obviously, you have to make a determination for what feels good for you and Every situation, but I'm always going to look to how do I retain the most equity myself, bring someone in, make sure that they're incentivized and valued versus, you know, ownership in the business.

Um, [00:31:00] to that point, I hear a lot of folks talk about, like, oh, I want to find an operator and give them equity in the business. And it's really interesting because it's coming from the right place. You want employees to feel like excited about ownership and stuff. But a lot of times. Um, they don't understand what that means and it doesn't drive them.

It doesn't inspire them. Like, they would much rather have cash in their pocket, or they would much rather have a, you know, half day on Fridays or those sorts of things. So, um, you know, making the assumption that you're going to incentivize somebody in your business or employees or whatever with equity.

Or profit share, or like that sort of stuff before you've met them and find out what motivates them is not necessarily a good way to go either. Because, like, we all know that ownership is the way to wealth. Right? Like, we want ownership. You should want it too. And they might not see it that way. So, like an operator.

Especially if it's, like, an operator that doesn't understand business or whatever, and they're just on the shop floor, like, they [00:32:00] just might want extra vacation or they want extra cash in their pocket. So I know that wasn't a direct answer to your question, but also something important to think about when we're thinking about the folks that we're going to be managing and working with and incentivizing is like, is there a different way to incentivize them?

That doesn't, Doesn't equate to me giving away parts of my business. 

**Jason:** I was 

**Athena:** perfect. 

**Steve:** Thank you. Um, because the answer what I'm looking for is not is to get out of the mindset of there's only one way to do this. What are all the different options? So that's that's why I was asking the question. So many 

**Athena:** different options.

So that that's the thing. And then Jason, I'll circle back to you. Um. When, and this is the thing I love about this world so much is like, I do not accept, no, it's never a, no, you know, there's just, we haven't figured out the way to solve the problem. So if, if a lender comes back and they're like, oh, you don't have arboring experience, you can't buy this business.

It's like, well, no, that's not the case. We just need to figure out what would make it the case that I could buy this business under what circumstances, you know, [00:33:00] or you don't have the liquidity to buy this business. Okay. Well, let's look at all of the finance stuff. toolkit, what one can we pull out or multiple to be like, let's get this deal done?

So there's endless amounts of creativity that we can have, which also means there's endless ways that you can end up hurting yourself in the process by giving away too much of your business or putting yourself at a disadvantage. Um, in in those situations, so, um, but there's, there's yeah, I love I love the creativity that you can have and and the Many different ways that you can do a deal.

Awesome. Steve. Um, thanks for your questions. That was really good. Jason. I, uh, are you still, yeah, there you are. 

**Jason:** Oh, I was just going to add to that conversation. I was probably listening to too many acquiring minds over the holiday break. And, uh, this guy had, uh, acquired a property management company. I think it was in Milwaukee or something like that.

[00:34:00] And, uh, You know, the number 1 had already been working on, uh, making his number 2, like, his replacement, uh, but he wasn't in a position to acquire the business, so this other guy did, uh, but basically he gave him, not equity, but they called it, like, phantom equity, so it's not like, it's not equity that would ever leave with that individual.

**Athena:** Yeah, that's um, it's a cool tool too, because they like, get to participate as an owner, but they don't necessarily have the liability and tax liability and everything as an owner, but they get incentivized with. As if they had equity in the business, so that's another way of doing it. It's a good point.

Jason. Um, you know, but I think if. If you're number 2, you got to look at the number twos in the business, like, when you're taking over a business and like, have they, how are they feeling about things? Like, have [00:35:00] they been treated? Well, have they been incentivized? And like, sometimes 1 of the things you can do a pot sweetener, like, right?

When you go and it's just give them a little raise when you, when you're like, gosh, they haven't had a raise. I'm going to give them all a little raise. And I've, I've heard of people doing that, just like giving them a raise or giving them a little bonus or throwing them a party or something right off the start.

And they're like, this is awesome, you know, cause they don't know about equity and all these other things. They don't, they don't necessarily, it doesn't motivate them, but just that way of coming in and like, we value you and notice that this hasn't happened. And, you know, so that that's a good way of playing it too.

Um, so I don't, I had 2 things I wanted to point out and then if anybody has deals or challenges or anything that they wanted to chat through while we're here, um, 1 is we've been kind of watching the process a little bit and have have a suggestion on the. Before you get to [00:36:00] process now that that we're spending a lot of time with you on the modeling and you've got an L.

O. I. template. You don't necessarily need to get the SBA involved pre LLI if there is nothing in the deal that's like a potential, like, crazy red flag or this might be different. So, um, depending on, on who you chat with and stuff, the SBA is always like, or your lenders, the banks. They're always kind of looking like they're going to dive in and be like, can we actually get this deal done?

So they will go to due diligence lengths that aren't necessary before the, the LOI some in some cases and can end up like dragging things out. So we do have it in the process, like get an SBA lender to give you a nod on the deal. Which you can do if you want that kind of confidence, you're like, maybe your debt service coverage ratio is like on the edge and you're like, I don't know if this would pass or that sort of [00:37:00] thing.

But if it's just a free include, like, it feels like a good fit, then right after you get assigned offer. That's when we want to see you go and speak to multiple lenders. Now, you don't want to go into underwriting with them, but you want to get a couple different offers so that you see what everybody's offering the terms that they're offering and what it's going to feel like to work with them.

Um, and you can do that right after and that's the 1st thing we like to see you do is, is, you know, get those commitment letters or preflights don't necessarily sign and go into underwriting until you've chosen 1. If there's nothing that, like, no crazy structuring that you're doing or anything where it's like, oh, I don't know if this would actually get by, you know, if you're using the modeling that we do, and you're at around that 1.

5, our modeling is so conservative, then it is likely to get be able to get signed off by by a lender. So, um, don't want you all to, you know, it's great to do that. [00:38:00] But sometimes it can, it can just. Muddy the waters a little bit when when the goal is, like, let's get it under exclusivity and then we can get.

Under the hood and get a little bit more details in terms of what the finance options are. So, um, hopefully that makes sense. Just kind of streamlining and helping you all get there quicker. Um, and then also something that has come up recently, um. Joe, I don't know if you mind me chatting, chatting about the differences between stock and asset sale and how that's coming up in a deal and kind of.

Bringing yours up as an example, if you're open to that,

**Joe:** um, I'll try, uh, 

**Athena:** well, I thought it was a really good example of like, how to how to decide. You know, when you're making offers and the differences between stock and asset sales, so I can talk about the particulars, but I thought, since this is a thing that we've been looking at with you, it'd be a great example to chat through.[00:39:00] 

**Joe:** Right. Um, you know, the one that comes to mind and that's probably what you're referencing is, uh, the industrial packaging company, right. And out of the gates, once Ryan did the interview and, uh, you know, the broker's involved, the broker is very protective over the seller, make, made it. Fairly hard to access the seller, um, out of the gates.

They said they wanted a stock sale. So, uh, and they were also set up as a C Corp and the reason they wanted a stock sale is, uh, I, I haven't looked into it. I, I think I trust kind of what's out there is they stand to avoid substantial taxes on the, on the gains on the business. If they run it as a stock sale.

Uh, the downside, which, you know, once we kind of got into the process and it took [00:40:00] a while for me to understand it is because the business was set up as a C Corp, um, they were getting additional taxes after their net income. So, the discretionary earnings that they were showing and the broker was showing, We're quite a bit different and higher compared to what we were calculating in our modeling sheet.

And then, of course, that took even further talking through with the seller to understand and the broker. And they had numbers in their minds that were much higher than what we were offering. And then, again, so that was based on a stock sale. Um, also on the stock sale, those are the, it's, what is it, the goodwill?

And what was the other line, Athena, in our calculator? 

**Athena:** Yeah, you may 

**Joe:** need those, right? 

**Athena:** Yeah. So the amortization of goodwill and then the depreciation of the deal. [00:41:00] Yeah. 

**Joe:** Yeah. So I learned that through the process where if you're doing a stock sale, you have to delete those 2 lines in our modeling sheet.

That will greatly change and frankly, it will reduce your debt service even more just on how the numbers work out. So in this case, uh, you know, the seller they, they had in their mind, they wanted a 4 million number for this, uh, industrial packaging company. They were claiming 1. 1. million dollars S. D. E. Um, and their overall revenues were eight and a half million dollars.

So they had a number in their mind and might the calculator and live oak lending or live oak bank, we kept coming up with a number that was well below was about 3. 4 million dollars. And again, based on a stock sale. [00:42:00] Now, if we leave those two lines in, the calculator for the amortization of goodwill and depreciation.

And we say, Hey, here's an option B and we do an asset sale. That number jumped up. It was a couple or a few hundred grand, but either way, it gave kind of a different option for the seller to see a better number, a higher number, although the transaction would be different and how they would look at capital gains in their taxes.

But frankly, where, I mean, my opinion where I think they were handcuffing themselves is they were set up as a C Corp and they kept getting these additional federal taxes hit on top of their net income. So, you know, all these layers of kind of expense or taxes, uh, in our calculator, which is very accurate, had a hard time making the numbers work out to anywhere close to what they wanted, so.

Those are, and those are the two model sheets you, Athena and Ryan had [00:43:00] sent you the other day, where the final numbers, I don't know what else to slice and dice it. It was 3. 4 million on the offer for stock and 3. 6 on. The asset sale. 

**Athena:** Yeah, and even still, so I think there's there's further adjustments there.

That was a great summary. So what I wanted to do is just pull up the template and show you some components about what Joe was talking about. Now, this month, we are working on getting like, a little bit more straightforward calculators, but it's why we always want to check your models before you send. Um, something off or finalize an offer is so we can pick up on these things with you.

Um, but can you all see my screen? Cool. Wait, actually, let me let me do this share. So I can be a little talking head here. There we go. Okay. So in the spreadsheet, all of the models are structured as an asset sale. So [00:44:00] in an asset sale, the thing that's really important is this amortization of goodwill. And what that means is that you are able to Amortize the purchase price over 15 years.

So every year you're going to get 1 15th of the purchase price that reduces your tax liability. So, when you do a stock sale, you're buying an existing entity. So the goodwill is like the business. It's the assets, those sorts of things. So you can't actually use this tool, which then changes the financial scenario.

So if you have a seller that's like beholden to a stock sale, this is, this is a play that we're working with Joe. It's like, well, you can show them the offer. With a stock sale and you can show them the offer with an asset sale. And those numbers should never be the same, right? Because to you, you're getting substantially less money.

Now in the [00:45:00] template, like let's say we're doing a purchase price of 1 million, it's a 1. 5, et cetera, et cetera. Like when you're looking at a stock sale versus an asset sale and what prices that you should offer, the thing you should be paying attention to is Like, 1st of all, you know, some like the depreciation of deal expenses, you might be able to do amortization of goodwill.

Not at all. So I want to show you, you know, the number that you're looking at that you get to take home is this free cash flow to owners. You are the owner. So in this scenario where it's an asset sale, all things the same, it's at 269, 000 as free cash flow to you, the owner. This isn't an asset sale, and this is like, assuming you set it up as an S corp and you have 37.

5 percent tax rate, which you probably won't even have that high. Um, you know, if you set it up, right, and you get the right tax folks, and we have some pretty amazing tax strategists, we [00:46:00] can refer you to if you ever need any, um, but your, your team's going to be talking you through this as well. But anyways, let's say worst case scenario tax rate in an asset sale, you at least get to depreciate and amortize, you know, almost 80, 000 dollars every single year against your taxes.

So look at what happens to the free cash flow, your distributable free cash flow, like. There's no investors here. You are the investors. 269, 000 in an asset sale. Now we delete these two lines. See, actually, I'm just going to delete them otherwise. So mess up the formulas here. We just delete those. Now let's and we've kept everything else the same.

Free cash flow to owners goes down by 29, 000 and this isn't a tiny deal, right? So extrapolate that out. If you're buying a 3 million business, a 5 million business, this number should be the same if you're making a [00:47:00] stock sale or an asset sale offer. So you need to reduce the stock sale number to the point that it matches What the asset sale number is.

So right now we're at 240. If we left the purchase price at 1 million, let's see what happens when we dropped it by 250, 000. There we go. We're now at 270. So this isn't a million dollar deal. We had to drop the entire purchase price by 250, 000 to make sure that the free cashflow matched what it did in the asset sale.

Because why would you Do a stock sale. If you weren't going to get the same amount of money to you and offer the same amount of money. It doesn't make sense. So what you can do if the owner is insistent on a stock sale is okay. I'll give you, I'll show you what the number will look like. If you were, if we do a stock sale, but it's going to be significantly less to you.

If we do an asset sale, this is what the number looks like. So if I'm Mr. Seller, and I'm like, well, I can get [00:48:00] 750, 000 if I do Uh, stock sale, and then they'll go away and they'll talk to their accountant, whatever. Uh, but if I do an asset sale, I'll get a 1, 000, 000 and he kind of want to make, like, you want the asset sale.

It's better for you. Don't inherit the liability. You get those tax benefits. So. You want to sweeten that 1 and make that 1 look the most appealing. So I would even drop this 1 a little bit lower because now, you know, if I do a C corp, I'm going to have to mess around with the extra taxation. So you're going to be taxed 20 percent at the corporate level.

And then you're also going to be taxed 21 percent at the, um, distribution level. So there's double taxation with a C corp. So I would even drop this 2. Lower, right? Because they don't get to see these models and stuff. So a 300, 000 dollar swing and purchase price, like, that's a 30 percent swing and purchase price on in this particular model.

So, I just wanted to show you all [00:49:00] really quickly what it actually looks like, and hopefully as plain of English as I can say it is. The money that you're taking should look the same, whether you're making a stock sale or an asset sales. So the, the levers that you have to pull that is, is changing that purchase price to make sure that you're not taking a significant hit.

So we should, you know, if, if. You're if you make an offer, it's and you're making it as an asset sale offer and they're like, no, it has to be a stock sale. Well, then the price needs to reflect that because you're going to be taking on significant hit there. Um, does that all make sense? And like I said, we're working on the templates to have separate ones for y'all.

But, you know, as a very basic understanding of the differences to you, Mr. Buyer, Mrs. Buyer as asset sale or stock sale.

[00:50:00] Thumbs up that help 

**Joe:** if I make a comment to our aren't all brokers incentivized on the top line sale price. So, wouldn't we push the, the asset sale anyways? Right? 

**Athena:** That is a. Amazing point. And so spawn that's, you know, you can tell you're in sales too, right? What's the benefit to the gatekeeper and the person, but you're, you're absolutely right.

The brokers are incentivized based on the purchase price. So you can pull the broker aside and be like, look, you and I both know that the asset sale is better. I'm guessing you probably be getting incentivized more with a higher purchase price and the asset sale. So like, what, what do you think is the.

You know, and this is where you can use that. Like, what's the whisper number here? Like, what's, how do we get this done? And so you can create an ally out of the broker. Like, Hey man, I want you to get paid too. I want you to be incentivized. Like I, I want [00:51:00] this business, but I want it as an asset sale. I know you probably get more.

What do we do here? That's an awesome point, Joe, and maybe something you can use. Right now in this, this whole thing with them, but just when you're doing those two different models, which you've set up, just make sure your cashflow to you is the same in both scenarios. And I'm guessing you probably need to drop your stock sale price.

Significantly lower to make that happen.

It's cool when these pieces start clicking together though. And it's like, you know, these, these concepts, it's like, well, what does that actually mean in stock sale versus asset sale? It's like, it's, well, it's cold hard cash in your pocket every year. If you, if you just give them the same price, regardless of the entity structure.

**Joe:** Athena, can I ask you another question? Can you pull the worksheet back up? Yeah. Uh, I was just on a call yesterday with Ryan. We were looking at, um, another opportunity. Uh, it [00:52:00] looks pretty straightforward. I'm pretty excited about it. And I was, we were doing a screen share looking at the numbers. And what wasn't making sense to me was that, uh, the section right below kind of the header section.

So I guess it's free cash flow to lenders. Yes. Okay. That number when I was running just my numbers in the deal, the number just seems super inflated compared to what the actual annual loan amount is. So what is that black line that says free cash flow to lenders? What is it? What are those numbers represent?

Because I just feel like they're high. 

**Athena:** Great, great question. So this number is actually calculating how much cash is available in the business that could go towards debt. So after taxes. So this and this is why this model is super conservative is because we're pulling the taxes out. Before we even start calculating the debt service.

So, like, this model accounts for the tax distributions that you need to make, because this model is built on the [00:53:00] idea that you have investors in the deal and they want their taxes paid. So, the taxes are pulled out your, your expenses, your capex, everything. So, this free cash flow to number or to lenders is the number.

It's the amount of money that's actually going to be available for lenders to be able to take after all the business. So, it's not the money, it's not the debt payments to them. That's what the senior term loan is. It's just like, how much money is actually available after, um, you know, the expenses are paid interest, et cetera, et cetera.

Um, what's left. And then that's where the debt service calculator or debt service coverage ratio is calculated from. So free cash flow to lenders is like, well, here's how much money the lenders could take. They could dig all of it. Right? If it's it's there. So [00:54:00] lenders need to get paid 1st. Then after the lenders.

The subordinated debt is, is the next person on the debt list, which is the seller notes. So they get money after the lenders do. And then after that is your investors. So that's the, you know, distributable free cash flow. And if you had an investor here, it would be pulling out. And then that's where you would get your money from after everybody else is paid.

So it's kind of a waterfall In this in this template, not all of you are bringing in investors or even, you know, necessarily using different types of notes, but it's it's organized in a way that you can waterfall it. And you're the last person to get paid. So then when you see this, um, debt coverage ratio here, it's like the SBA.

Senior debt. Um, then the, uh, like SBA senior debt and then all debt. So we're looking at two different numbers. Here is like, what's the senior debt? Like, the biggest debt holder. What's their debt service [00:55:00] coverage ratio? And then when you add in everybody else, is it still that 1. 5?

That makes sense?

**Joe:** Yep. I'm good. 

**Athena:** Good questions, um, really good questions. And I, you know, the more that we get in here and start messing around with the numbers and seeing where, um, where it shifts things, it, it, it, you know, makes it easier to understand. But, um, the stock versus asset sale 1 is unfortunately sometimes with folks out there, they, they, I found the.

The explanation is over complicated. It's just like, well, the money in your pocket every year is different. And here's how, you know, like, that's a big deal. And also, you're inheriting the liability of that business. But even when you do, and we heard this from Barlow Williams before the break, even if you do an asset, [00:56:00] so, like, you're still liable for, for certain components of it, just maybe not the entirety of the liability, but it's that kind of fight over who's going to have the tax implications.

Um, you know, At the sale, um, and that's usually why the seller is pushing for a stock sale is because it will make their tax situation a lot more advantageous to do a stock sale versus an asset sale.

1 of the things that you can do to, like, you know, minimize the hit on on capital gains in the 1st year is, is. See, if they want to take a bigger note, and then it spreads it over time. Um, so that's 1 way of doing it, but I think it's a great opportunity to talk to the broker and be like, you'll get more if I do an asset sale.

So how do we make this happen? You know, how do we convince the seller? Like, what what can we do here to structure this? So that they end up going for it and you get paid more[00:57:00] 

great questions. I just saw we're at time. I got so excited about talking about all that. But, um, so on Thursday, I hope every single 1 of you can make it because we are having Chris. Barrett from Midwest CPA, who does amazing QAV reports. He's going to come on and he's going to talk to you about three things.

What you should look for in the finances when you have very limited finances. So maybe you only have the SEM before LOI. So what should you be looking for there? Then, once you get assigned LOI, what are the first things you should start looking at, uh, you know, documents you should collect, et cetera, to do a little bit of due diligence before you order the full QOV report, because when you order the QOV, that is the extensive financial due diligence, and there is, there's a price tag attached to that, and he's going to walk you through a QOV report, you're going to see a full QOV report, what things are in there, Uh, [00:58:00] why you need those things so that you understand, you know, okay, this is what I'm going to get in the end and how I'm going to be protected in terms of, you know, them looking under the hood and doing extensive financial due diligence.

And then here are the markers based on where I'm out in the process. And with the amount of information that I have available that I can decide whether this is a go no go. So oftentimes we're so scared by what we're seeing early on and what we don't know. Uh, you know, none of us are, are like registered CPAs.

So it's like, well, crap, their, their numbers are scary. They're messy. Like maybe I should walk away from this business, but he's going to talk you through like the things that you should be paying attention to, um, as you go through the process and those three different stages, and then being able to see a full Q and B report and what what's in there so that you know, okay, well.

I don't think this is a deal breaker, but I know that this is going to be covered off when I do financial due diligence and also that report will [00:59:00] help you have like an actual report to go back to the seller and have more meaningful conversations about the working capital about those adjustments to SD.

It's not just the 2 of you battling back and forth. It's like, well, you know, this 3rd party that did a forensic analysis of your numbers came back. So it's, you know, this is what we're looking at here. So. I'm super excited about him joining. Um, he's really great at what he does, uh, really good at explaining things.

So I hope you all can make it on Thursday. Um, and really excited for this year. The, the team's been telling me that already the deal flow is, is coming in thick and hot. So there should be a lot of really exciting deals coming through. We know a mid Jan is when people start closing out their books from last year and deals start hitting.

So we're excited about all of that too. Um, and, uh, lots of you are moving towards offers right now, too, which is amazing and, uh, Lindsay's not here, but they just closed on, [01:00:00] on, uh, business on December 30th, too. So that's a celebration in the Acme match fam. But, um, thank you all. Thanks for your questions. If you have any further questions about the stuff that we talked about, feel free to drop that in the buyer's club channel.

We can continue the conversation and then, um, we're going to do, uh, more, um, in depth session. So, um, all. Like I said, this Thursday is QV. Next Thursday is going to be a discussion on ROBS. So, how you can use your retirement accounts on, uh, on your deals without a tax event. So, there's actually ways to be able to use your retirement accounts Um, as part of your down payment or for your post blows liquidity, and it doesn't create a taxable event on on your retirement account.

So Susie is going to be coming and sharing all of that. It's super interesting, exciting, and also another tool in the financial toolkit. And then next Tuesday, we'll have another discussion like this, where we can just chat about the things that [01:01:00] come up as they come up. So thank you all. And like I said, if you have any further questions on this stuff, drop it in the channel.

That's where it's there for pick it up with Ryan and the team. We're here to support you and get you closer to becoming business owners. So, whatever we can do to support you. We want to do that. Okay, sounds good. Thanks. Thanks so much. Y'all. We'll see you on Thursday. See you on Thursday. All right. Bye. Bye.
