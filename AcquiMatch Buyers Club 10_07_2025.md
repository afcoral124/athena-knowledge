# Buyers Club Strategy Session

[00:00:00] 

**Athena:** Hello?

Hi, welcome.

Are, are you pointing at Carmen? Being here? Hello Carmen? Yeah. She's here for, yay. It's a miracle. Awesome. Welcome to Tuesday Bar Club. So we've got some fun. Deals, uh, that y'all are working on, team's been updating you on 'em. So I'm gonna pick on a couple of you to check in and, and see how you're doing, um, on those.

So, um, Josh, I was gonna have you kinda on deck. You've got one that's, uh. Hot deal right now that you're working on. It's got some government contracts, so just wanted to check in and see where you're at with it. See where you're at. I think you had some seller meetings and you're doing some modeling, so fill [00:01:00] us in, give us an overview and then, uh, if there's anything that we can help with or unstick or next steps for you.

**Josh:** Yeah, absolutely. Um, so yeah, as you mentioned, it's a government contracting. One leans to my, uh, past experience in the military and that kind of thing, so. Think it's a good fit. I like the business model. It's pretty easy to, uh, wrap my head around and it has kind of a competitive edge based on process and quality, which is kind of my bread and butter.

Uh, I have the seller call tomorrow, so I'm focusing on prepping for that one right now. So I'm just kind of going through and doing some, uh, deeper research about the company, its suppliers, some of the certifications it has and that kind of stuff to help with my buyer positioning. Um, because the way I'm thinking right now to mitigate the.

50% of the buying or the ownership team right now is, um, the, the business. So I wanna try to figure out a way to kind of mitigate around, um, basically all of that knowledge. Um, so I was kind of thinking a performance note to mitigate my risk there. [00:02:00] Um, and then also having an employment contract for them to mitigate their risk of me being an unknown entity.

So that's kind of where I'm at. 

**Luke:** You might have missed the strongest highlight there though, Josh. You just brushed over it, isn't it? It's not a seller call, right? It's a two hour in-person meeting in the broker's office. Yeah, 

**Josh:** that's right. 

**Luke:** Yep. That's a lot better than a seller call. 

**Josh:** Yeah, so they, uh, yeah, they, they, uh, they set up, he, so that, that was a fun one 'cause I hopped on the broker call and he tried to like, just like say, I'm not gonna talk to you until you go through this process and that kind of stuff.

So I just, you know, laid on my smooth smoothness as it were and just told him like, Hey. Uh, let's have some fun here. So got through that one and by the end of it, or actually halfway through the call, he was trying to set up a owner call with me or an owner meeting in his office. So, um, then got that through, so, yep.

**Athena:** So have you had a, um, have you had a call with the owner yet or is this the first time you're meeting him? 

**Josh:** [00:03:00] This will be the first time I'm meeting him. 

**Athena:** Okay, cool. And there's multiple owners, right? It's, it's some family member owner situation. 

**Josh:** So it's, um, it's a C corp. It would need to be a stock sale just because the certifications aren't transferrable in the sale and that's kind of, its bread and butter and competitive advantage.

Um, not a highly, what I consider litigation pro business, um, because they're not dealing with like consumers as much. Um, so I'm not overly concerned about like that kind of stuff in the past. But, um, sorry, what was the question? My mind just went completely the opposite direction. 

**Athena:** It's okay. Uh, stock sales aren't necessarily a bad thing, especially in this situation where there's contracts and stuff and there's, there's ways to protect yourself in the stock sale.

Um, I said there was the, like some family members that are Oh, yeah. Ownership. 

**Josh:** Yeah, so it's, um, C Corp. 70% is the son. Um, and he's the president. 28% is [00:04:00] the, um, dad who is mostly part-time at this point. Um, and then the son's wife has just under 2%, give or take. Um, so I think the, the biggest one that's going to continue, and he said that he is interested in staying on too, to make sure the transition smooth is his son.

That's where most of it's centralized in. Um, I'm gonna try to feel out kind of what the dad's doing as well as the, um, the wife of the son, um, so I can get an idea for, you know, what needs to be hired out for and that kind of thing. Uh, talking to the brokers sound like the dad is mostly doing kind of, uh, bookkeeping and CFO type stuff.

Um, and they, they had it in there as like a hundred k per year. But, you know, looking through at some of the, the different agencies and stuff where you can go out to fractional CSOs or bookkeeping and, you know, more of a comptroller role, like you can outsource that for a lot cheaper. So I'm notably concerned about that.

Um, and then the other one, um, is like the quality office manager type [00:05:00] position. I kind of want to get a feel for how specialized that is. Um, they don't seem to think it is, but. Um, if the owner's son's staying on for a year, then that's plenty of time for me to kind of slowly replace people, work with them, get the knowledge I need, build the relationships and that kind of stuff.

So, 

**Athena:** um, did the broker set the stage at all for what he expects to be covered in that first meeting? Did he give you any coaching or overview on like how he likes those? Or what, what topics are like cool and not cool. Curious what his process was if he was hard. Hard being the, the gatekeeper at first, 

**Josh:** no, he didn't really, uh, give me much on it, so I'm more just boiling the ocean and preparing for all eventualities.

**Athena:** Great. Okay. What's your overall goal or outcome from when you leave this meeting? What do you want to happen? 

**Josh:** Lemme pull up my notes. Um, main objectives. I want the seller to want me to buy the business and I want to build trust, credibility, [00:06:00] and alignment. So they see me as the natural successor. So that's the overall objective.

Um, I'm working on positioning myself as collaborative, trustworthy, problem solver, uh, competent and has enough, you know, background knowledge to run the business and carry their legacy excited about what they're doing. Um, capable of closing the deal if it's a right fit. Um. Then the things I wanna learn out of it are where they see the opportunities are kind of a history in the business and who does what.

Um, so I can kind of start modeling around that and get a, a better feel for the risk around that. Um, might flush out some negotiation things if it goes that way, but I'm not gonna really go down the path of like LOI negotiation and that kind of stuff, unless they go there. But it's like primarily focused on, you know, just learning.

Getting to know the seller, right? 'cause if I'm gonna have to work for New Year, it's, you know, important that we get along. So, um, but then the other thing I liked about it is that there's enough, um, SDE after I pay myself to [00:07:00] professionalize the business too, without hurting the margins too much. So, 

**Athena:** awesome.

I love the, um, outcome for them. What I would say to like, give yourself a, a line in terms of your outcome is. That first seller meeting, I'm always, you know. So this is another dating analogy. My friend actually told me this when I was single and I was dating, and she's like, you know, I always just like ask them a bunch of questions and I make sure that they have so much fun and they just enjoy the experience because then the ball's in my court.

'cause everybody always wants a second date with me, right? But while she's doing that, she's kind of analyzing them or whatever. So when you're there, it's absolutely positioning yourself to be the successor. Get them excited about you, want you to be the buyer. But also as you're doing that, picturing whether you can see yourself in that business.

Yeah. And say like, in a line. Right. And then the risk and that sort of stuff can come, but like the overall, like, could I see myself working with these people and in this [00:08:00] business based on, you know, two hour conversation should give you a really good Yeah. Perspective on that. Um, so. Then a way you can, like, do you know how competitive this is?

How many other buyers they've been speaking to? How many, have they seen any offers yet? Any idea what that landscape looks like? 

**Josh:** Not that I know of today. I think, um, Luke was pretty quick and getting on the call with the broker after it was, uh, soft listed on their site. So, um, I might be, first up, I don't know, but I'll kind of get an idea for that if I can, but probably won't probe it too much.

**Athena:** Um. What I like to more, more 

**Josh:** around the, the next steps thing, like when I get to the end of it, like figuring out like, Hey, what kind of timeline are you looking for? Next steps, right? That'll be hypothetically when the broker would like say, oh, we got other offers. You need to move quick, kind of thing, right?

Or like, you know, we wanna see an offer, LI or IOI or whatever it may be. So, 

**Luke:** yeah, so we, we picked this up the week it got listed and then the broker told [00:09:00] me it was even a soft launch. He hadn't technically listed it on all the websites yet. We just picked it up back quickly. 

**Athena:** Amazing. So. Josh, what you could potentially do, I know you're doing all the modeling and everything is like get almost an LOI and a model pre-populated that if the meeting goes really well, you could potentially get it out pretty quickly after that and snatch it up before the competition like gets in there.

Um, yeah, it, it sounds like you're really excited about this. So that's, that's one tactic potentially that you could take is go ask questions. Um, if there's time or if there's another meeting after that, or if there's other offers, then what I typically like to do is, is talk to the seller like a human and be like, Hey, have you like met with a bunch of buyers?

Like, what are you liking or not liking about it? Or like, what's your biggest concern about this process? Or, you know, seeing an offer, just like speaking to them like humans that are probably going through a very stressful [00:10:00] process. Um. Can often give you the intel, you know, like, oh, you know, like, and if they've spoken to other people like, oh, they want me to like stay in the business and do an earnout for five years, or, you know, or just ask 'em, like, Hey, what, what's really important to you about this transition?

Like, you know, is it, is it getting out as soon as possible? Is it getting the most money? Is it, you know, making sure you're handing off to somebody that's gonna look after it? Well, like, so that's a way that you can get some intel too, without pissing off the broker. Yeah, because like, and that's, that's why I was curious what, um, his, and you might get a lot of brownie points if you reach out to the broker before and be like, Hey, so this was kind of the.

My thought for the meeting, is there anything that you don't want me discussing with them that I should pick up with you afterwards? And like, is there any process that I should be aware about on your side? Especially if he was like hard at first, hardnosed at first and said like, oh, you gotta follow my process.

That'll, he will [00:11:00] love you for that.

**Josh:** Okay. Nope. Well, I was gonna email him today anyway with, um, a touchpoint, so. 

**Athena:** Yeah. Very cool. Anything else you're, uh, muddling over or how you feeling? Can we help you get any clarity on it? Any part of it? 

**Josh:** Um, no, I think, yeah, once I get to the point I, I'm pretty clear on what the, um, the offer would look like.

I'm just kind of playing with the, um, performance note, um, because I can go higher on purchase price with that. 'cause I think the two things I'm trying to mitigate for are one. There was a 37% drop in top line, um, in 2022. So I wanna make sure that doesn't happen in the first year, um, post close before I have time to build up kind of a capital reserve in the business.

Um, and the second thing is making sure that I can [00:12:00] successfully transition the knowledge from the owners to myself, right? So if I do it with a performance note, that works well. Um. But yeah, that's pretty much it. And even when, um, I rebuilt the p and l and I went through kind of just like playing like, okay, 2022 just happened.

Now what? You're in the owner's shoes. So I started like, tweaking stuff and like figuring out like, okay, what management decisions would I make? How would I operate this? Um, you know, where could I lean up or not? And it's pretty, it's pretty okay. It's like you're, it's risk, it's scary, but it's not like, oh no, right.

Like, I think if I drop my owner comp by like 10,000 bucks and then manipulate a few of the other variables, it's like you're breaking even barely. So 

**Athena:** with the 37% drop. 

**Josh:** Yeah. 

**Athena:** Well, that's pretty fantastic. So that's a pretty significant drop. Um, do you have any idea that's, that's with the 

**Josh:** performance note?

**Athena:** Yeah. Yeah. Okay, cool. [00:13:00] Um, the, do you have any idea where the drop came from in 22? 

**Josh:** The only quote that we've had, and it sounds like a smokescreen, is COVID. 

**Athena:** Yeah. 'cause I'm wondering, you know, 22 is usually either a spike or a draw, and it, it's usually a normalization. Um, so like, it can be like a post COVID pickup for some businesses, so it looks like a spike and then a drop in, usually 22 or 23.

Yeah. Um, because they were catching up on work they weren't able to do during COVID. Or, um, it, it, it, it is a drop from like a, a spike that they had earlier. So usually it's a normalization. So if you can get earlier years. Yeah. How long has the business been around for? Quite a while, right? 

**Josh:** Yeah. 37 years.

**Athena:** Yeah. So if you can get numbers like pre COVID and compare to where that drop happened and see if it was just a, a normalization. So sometimes I'll just remove [00:14:00] 2021. Um. Yeah. 'cause 

**Josh:** 21 was really good too, and it was a really curious year, like looking at it because their, their top line dropped by that 30, you know, X percent, but their gross margins like doubled that year.

Um, but then their nets were interested because their salaries increased by, uh, you know, 500% that year. Not the owner salaries, like the, just the team. So something interesting was going on in the business, but then it normalized the year after that back down. So. 

**Athena:** Yeah, so it, it might, might be, if you can get your hands on earlier years, like comparing and just seeing if, if you were to remove the outliers, what then, um, that might give you some, uh, some confidence there rather than there just being that volatile of a draw.

Um, 

**Josh:** yeah, because like if that drop happens in like year two or three, it's like I'm not concerned about it because it's like I've had time to build up enough reserves. To make sure that, you know, you can [00:15:00] weather it for a year or so. So, yeah. 

**Athena:** Cool. Well, when, when is the meeting? Tomorrow you said? 

**Josh:** Yeah, 11:00 AM.

**Athena:** That's 

**Josh:** the other exciting thing. It's only a 40 minute drive from my house, so 

**Athena:** Yay. We love it. We love it when it's commuting distance, 

**Josh:** which, which is really short for Southern California. 

**Athena:** Oh, I remember. Uh, was, uh, that was. Some wild, like it could be a couple miles away and take forever. So that's cool. Um, keep us posted, send us an update in the channel after you're done.

Uh, and this is for you and everyone. If you don't wanna type it out, we'd love voice notes 'cause we get to hear your excitement or your mood. Also, whether it's excitement or not excitement. So feel free to drop a voice note if it's easier. Uh, give us the full update. Um, very cool stuff. Awesome. Thanks Josh.

Um, Carmen and Lisa, I was gonna call on you, you were doing some, uh, modeling on, um, your deal and thought it was worth just having a discussion and seeing if you wanted to pull out [00:16:00] anything further on that. Um, or if you felt like you were in a good place. So first of all, you were doing the numbers and you discovered some things, and then there was also some stuff on the business.

Um, so I think it's worth sharing with everybody so they can learn. 'cause that's just a non-starter with SBA. 

Yeah. Um, so I mean the, the things that kind of popped up. You know, the, the seller was set on a $6 million price, uh, specifically 5.1 million cash at close. So I did financial modeling, um, of just 5.1 million at close, like straight up cash to him.

Um, and I modeled it also as a $6 million purchase price with a 15% seller note as well. And since it's a little above what we would want to give in cash, I set it up with like, uh, with a 6% number equity injection from us [00:17:00] and 5%, um. On full standby with them. Um, and then the other 10% I set up as a performance based note.

And so, like you were just talking about 2022, there was a spike in revenue. And so I did some quick calculations, seen that, um, the difference between 2024 numbers and the 2022 revenue numbers was about 23%. So I put the target at 23%. I put the floor at 12% I think it was. Mm-hmm. And set it up as pro rata.

And the numbers just. We're below 1.5 for no change. And then like if, if we had a J curve, both scenarios, it would like, we'd be in financial ruins. So that was, that was a non-starter for us. Um, and then also the 20, 25 numbers they only had through [00:18:00] August, but, um, they're negative in profit for the year, um, which is not.

Not a good place to start. No, I was gonna negative ask you 

**Athena:** about that though, because if, if you were to look at, so first of all, uh, in the video that you sent over, yes. On the performance note, you ha you did have it set to target instead of prorata. So I just thought I'd point that out. 

I did. 

**Athena:** Thank you for that.

No worries. When, when, um, when we have a floor, I, I always like Parata if we're doing a performance note. Um, it, it mitigates for potential litigation down the line if there's something right, like no matter what. Um, and um, so the target is, you know, there's, there's setting for Target in there, but I'm, I'm sharing this for everybody 'cause you were doing it Prorata, but if you set it at Target, then the modeling won't.

[00:19:00] Uh, project your payments unless that top target is hit. So just making sure we have it set to prorata. Um, and then the negative profit. So was this the case in previous years before add backs? So, so that's similar. 

That's a great question. So I asked for monthly p and ls from previous years and they said they did not have that data to share.

Um, so I couldn't compare. Um, the other thing that we saw from a previous deal, um. So, so this is a roofing slash solar company for, to give everyone some background. And when we were looking at our previous solar deal, um, they had some challenges with their revenue and expense recognition. It wasn't truly accrual based and it wasn't being done.

Uh. For this [00:20:00] particular project, I, I asked if it was, um, if the accounting was done by percentage completion and they said it was done by full completion of the projects. So their accounting's a little bit wonky. Um. So that was like a yellow flag because I have a feeling like a QOE would tell us more about like what was really happening.

Yeah. However. There were some other issues that made me not want to move forward to that. So for everyone's benefit, I'll say what those are. Um, the other piece, there was a quarter of a million dollar loan to the owner that was listed, which was interesting to us, right? Like if the business was profitable, why would they need to take a loan?

Again, yellow flag, not a red flag. Um, but then what, what the two big red flags were. [00:21:00] The, this deal was a combination of two different businesses. There are two different business entities. So one was a union based company where they used union based um, installers. And the other company was a non-union based company.

And in talking with the broker, basically they bid everything out as a union job. And if that was too expensive, they'd have their other non-union company come bid it in. And I'm like, is that legal? And she's like, why not? Technically it's legal, it's kind of frowned upon, but there are other companies that do it.

So I, we wanna be straight shooters. Like we don't want any question marks as far as ethics going on there. And we don't, uh, we don't wanna step into any problems there. So even though, like technically it was [00:22:00] legal, um, the letter of the law is that. If you own a union business, you cannot own a non-union business and the employees cannot be intermingled.

Um, the non-union business apparently has one employee, and that was the owner's wife. The owner's wife is not doing all of the administrative, hr, accounting, bookkeeping, all the other stuff. It's just not happening, right? So. It is not legit. And so that values red flag was up. That wasn't the worst though.

But wait, there's more. Um, the kicker was, in talking to the broker, she let us know that there's an ongoing $17.6 million lawsuit and there's no way that's gonna be settled before the sale. So as, thank you Athena for pointing out to us. [00:23:00] So it was a red flag to us, but Athena pointed out that, uh, an ongoing lawsuit is a non-starter for SBA.

So. Yeah, it's 

**Athena:** one of the, it's one of the first things that lenders will do. This is another reason why we like getting turn sheets before you start, like paying deal team and stuff. Because if, if there's any ongoing litigation going on, a business, SBA can't be used. So that's for everybody to just be aware of.

Um, you know, I. Was involved in it, like probably the most traumatizing thing I've ever been involved in. Where there was a lit, you know, there was a lawsuit and then we had to figure out a different structure and a different payment and everything. You can get deals done. Um, it's just really painful and I think everybody here is planning on using SBA.

So, um, something I will say on the, the, some of those points, yes, you know, red flags on the yellow flags, um. There's always a different story when you talk to [00:24:00] the owner, and sometimes it's explainable, right? So like an, an owner taking a loan from the business that wouldn't necessarily give, you know, it's like it's on their books.

So I'm like, okay, let me dig into that and find out what's going on there. You know, maybe it was a tax strategy or something like that. Um, and then the, um, the negative most. Businesses are gonna be doing their books to be tax advantaged, not exit advantaged. So it, and it's very conflicting, right? So if, um, if somebody has a negative profit, but then when you add the, the add-backs back, it looks, you know, fairly kosher and it would be legitimate add-backs, then you, you have a story there.

It's when, um.

You know, like you said, this year it's tracking lower. We don't have the historicals to actually be able to compare. Is that a normal thing for [00:25:00] them or not? So, uh, that's, that's where I say like, okay, verify, right? Like, we pick up on these things and then it's, it's worth having a conversation directly with the owner.

Brokers kind of regurgitating things, but also good for the broker for disclosing. Like, Hey, there's some union stuff here. There's a lawsuit here, so. That's good if they're telling you those sorts of things rather than trying to bury it. So if that's happening, then I kind of almost, I'm like, maybe, maybe there's, um, some, some things that, uh, you know.

They were disclosing that they didn't have to or could have been found out down the line. So I like it when brokers do that and they give you the real tea. Um, but with the union stuff, like, then it's a, a values alignment thing. So if, if it's feeling completely out of line and you know, this industry backwards and forwards and you're like, that's just an absolute no-no, then, you know, then you can, uh, eliminate it for that reason.

Was there anything else that, um. You thought was worth chatting through on that one, [00:26:00] or were you guys got stuck or challenged?

**Carmen:** I, I have a question. So in their, in their books, they have an add back of $600,000. So when the lawsuit happened, their insurance kind of spike up the next year and they added that difference. As an add back, is that really an add back? 

**Athena:** Oh, I see. Okay. So they got, they got sued and then their insurance spiked massively.

And then they're saying, oh, the new owner won't, yeah. That, 

**Carmen:** that's not gonna happen again. So like they, they added that $600,000 to their add-backs. Uh, I, 

**Athena:** it's it. Um, there's a, there's a really great buyer's club with Andy from NewCo Risk that I would recommend watching, like for everybody in insurance, we're like, uh, insurance, whatever.

But actually it can be [00:27:00] material differences to SDE and everything. Um, because what, what Andy and his team will do is part of the due diligence process. They'll look at all of the insurance claims, all the workman's comp claims, all of the insurance policies, um, and they'll be like, Hey, there's, there's workman's comp.

Claims that haven't yet hit, and it doesn't matter whether it's a stock or an asset sale, like it's gonna follow you into. The next business and your insurance is gonna go up, and then you can have a material difference to STE as a result of that, right? So you can go back during diligence and be like, Hey, we discovered these things.

Our policies are gonna go up by this amount, so we're gonna retrade and lower the STE e number as a result of that. I can't imagine if the policies went up because of a lawsuit of somebody using a blowtorch on someone's roof and burning a house down with that crew like that, that wouldn't necessarily follow you in as a new owner, but that's, that's always something.

Um. You know, Andy, uh, and, and the team over there are super [00:28:00] happy to like, answer those one-off questions too. What's really cool about them is there's no charge to do the insurance due diligence because they're obviously hoping that you would want to place your policies with them after the fact. But all they do is work with searchers.

Um, and they're really great at telling you when you have policies that are too good. For them to be able to like, be as, as well. So, um, I'd recommend watching that. I'd also say like, no, probably not. So that's, you know, if we remove that amount from the st I'm guessing it doesn't look very, very good. Well, 

and then, you know, exercise.

Sometimes right back into the financial modeling, right? So like I modeled it, including that, uh, add back, knowing that that probably wouldn't fly with the SVA, um, or us even. Um, so knowing that the modeling didn't do well with that add [00:29:00] back, um, yeah, I, I knew we weren't gonna meet on price even. 

**Athena:** Yeah, it's good, but it's good you're doing, doing the modeling and looking at all that so you can have numbers.

It was great 

**Jenny:** exercise. 

**Athena:** Yeah, good, good. Learnings all around on that and also probably learning even more about an industry that you guys are interested in as a result of those conversations. Good stuff. Um, awesome. Anymore on that one? You guys good for that one? Feeling good about it. We're good. Thank you.

We're good. Cool. Awesome. Um, all right, next, I was gonna call on Jenny. Uh, I just know that you put something in the channel so I don't have any background. And then after that I was gonna chat with Michael as well on his deal. So, um, Jenny, you as far as I know, uh, and sorry I didn't have a chance to catch up.

Asset versus stock sale. Is the conversation happening right now? If you wanna give us just an overview on what's happened and what you could use some insight 

**Jenny:** on. Yeah, definitely. So this [00:30:00] is actually the same deal I brought like two weeks ago. Um, so it's the same like Xpl L Logistics company. Um, we submitted an LOI, which the broker had made some requests in response.

Um, initially it was, uh. For a stock sale versus asset sale. Um, I think also somebody sent me in the channel there, there is like a buyer's club on this and I know that there's kind of like benefits. I think it was really around taxes and um. And basically the brokers come back and said like, we're not definitively asking for a stock sale.

So like, it sounds like they're open. And then I'm just kind of curious your advice on how to structure that. And like I know even on that broker's, the Buyer's Club call, there was like some joint options where you can do a little bit of both. Um, so I would like to submit [00:31:00] something that kind of maximizes my position, I would say as a start.

Yeah. What was, and then I, so, oh, carry on Jenny. There's a like part two, but if you wanna like knock out that part first. Let's, we can chat about that. 

**Athena:** No, tell me part two. So I, I meander back to part two. Okay. Like 

**Jenny:** where we're going? Well, I would say, so this company started in like, I wanna say 2018 ish. So it's relatively young.

I would say. It's so, I, it's like younger. It's not a industry I'm familiar or have experience in. So just like de-risking. Possibilities that, or like suggestions, like I would guess some sort of performance note or, um, and just like anything else that you can think of to include, to help me. Like de-risk 

**Athena:** for yourself?

**Jenny:** Yes. 

**Athena:** Okay. Um, on the, uh, stock versus asset sale, so [00:32:00] Roman, uh, did a really great buyer's club. I'm telling you, you probably have to watch it three times. It is, yeah. It is taxi, right. But I, I love tax stuff and tax strategy. So essentially, um, there are different ways. Do you know what kind of corp? Is it a C Corp or an S corp?

**Jenny:** Um, I know, hold on. I have that here. Um, I wanna say it's an S corp. 

**Athena:** If it is, then there's, there is a strategy around that. Um, for what you can do is basically like, it's a stock sale for tax purposes, but um, an asset sale for liability. You know, there's a way of like. The easiest way to describe it that I wrap my head around it is imagine a caterpillar going into a cocoon and coming out of butterfly.

So you basically [00:33:00] take whatever the original entity is in a stock sale and it comes out kind of treated as an asset sale for that for tax purposes. Sorry. Um, so I had that reversed. It depends on why they want this stock sale. 

**Jenny:** Do you know what their purpose is? Um. I believe it was for, there are some like contracts to transfer.

Okay. Um, and then I think just like the buyer's, like, I guess some, I don't know if it was like a lawyer or who he was consulting with, it was like favorable for taxes. So maybe it was his accountant. 

**Athena:** Yeah. So, um, that's something that, that Roman talked about in the buyer's club, and he talks about a lot too, is it, it depends, right?

Like whether it's gonna be favorable for whoever, and then you're able to, it depends on how everything's allocated when you go through the process a little bit further down the line. So what I like to [00:34:00] do in these scenarios, when you're negotiating the LOI is, um, I try to have. Verbal conversations rather than email, because then you can kind of like read between the lines on like what's important here.

Yeah. Um, so when people have like multiple red lines on something, I'll be like, Hey, can we jump on a call and talk it through? And then like, okay, prioritize it for me. What's the non-negotiables and what are you flexible on? Right. Like, let's have a conversation and let me find out the reason why. So it's like, okay, you want a stock sale.

Can you explain a little bit more to me? They're like, actually there's a ton of contracts. Like that's gonna be really hard to reassign. It might affect your income after the fact. Okay. That's a really good piece of intel and you probably do wanna consider a stock sale for that reason. Yeah. Um, also when there's a ton of assets, which this I believe has a lot of.

Hard assets, that can be a nightmare to try to like reassign all the ownership and titles and all that sort of stuff. Um, and then you're gonna have to deal with the bank also putting liens on all that, which is fun. [00:35:00] Um, so sometimes it does make sense for a stock sale. Now with a stock sale, you are not going to be able to, um, have amortization of the goodwill.

So there's gonna be less of a, like, tax advantage for you after the fact, and you're also not gonna be able to depreciate the deal expenses so your co your, you know, cost to actually acquire it. Um, so in the model, it allows you to do stock sale versus asset sale from a purely financial modeling standpoint.

I like to see you all like, okay, if I had a price that I was happy with an asset sale, and I look at what the free cash flow number is to me in that asset sale. Let me flip to stock sale. Yep. Adjust. I did do that. Yep. Perfect. So like if, then you'd probably be adjusting the terms or the purchase price. So your free cash flow number is the same regardless whether it's a stock sale or an asset sale.

Yeah. And then, um, so is that what happened then? [00:36:00] You presented 'em with the price. If you were to do stock sale. 

**Jenny:** I haven't yet. I'm just, I was trying to like position myself properly. Yeah. Like going into submitting my LOI and I wasn't sure if also like submitting my LOI, like if post LOI, we would have conversations where we could like re jiggle this and be like, maybe we wanna do half, half or like, is it just better to like submit And sort of, I just, I think what I'm worried about a little bit is because like the asset and stock sale.

To get that same free cash flow. Price is so variable that like, later negotiating some middle ground might cause some friction. 

**Athena:** Yeah. So, um, you're thinking about this in the right way, right? Like the negotiation and the relationship, the relationship's still early. My preference is always like, let's, you know, leave it lighter in the L loi.

You know, and then say, we're gonna have to [00:37:00] obviously have some conversations about this, like the working capital needs, the inventory, the tax allocation, but just know I want us to come out of this win-win, right? Yeah. So like I kind of try to. Lean on the relationship in that regard and be like, I don't have enough information right now and I also don't wanna start paying a bunch of people to advise me on this before we get an under offer.

Yeah. So I can have a, a conversation with my tax folks once this is under offer. We can collaborate on that. So like, what I like about Roman and his team is like, they don't necessarily, they're not your, they don't have to be your lawyers. On it. They do hourly, which isn't my favorite. So Barlow Williams do fixed fees as far as like legal advice, I think they will also do tax support as well.

Yeah. But if you needed an extra, like, okay, let's do a whole tax assessment, Roman and his team will just do that as a CarVal. Look at like the tax allocations, what the tax situation's gonna be like for both you and the owner. 'cause you don't [00:38:00] want the owner screwed in this either, right? Yeah. So. Then you can kind of look at the tax allocations after the fact.

But that will be, you know, uh, when you have a lot more information than you do now. Pretty LOY. 

**Jenny:** Okay. Because I feel like the stock price at that free cashflow level is way lower, and I feel like that's a better place to stake myself at and say like, sure, I can do this, but here's what I'll pay and then I can negotiate in the opposite direction if it.

It's favorable from a tax perspective. So 

**Athena:** absolutely anchor and low be like, Hey, I had a look. If we were to do a stock sale, this is how the purchase price and the terms would adjust. Okay. Um, but you know, I'm happy for us to. I wouldn't even say it at first. Just be like, this is what it looks like from a stock sale perspective.

And then they will probably want to go to asset sale. And then it really is during diligence, looking at your legal team will look at all those contracts, right? Yeah. And see if it's assignable or not. And you might have to flip to stock sale. So. [00:39:00] Yep. 

**Jenny:** Um, and then part two of like de-risking this for me, ugh.

**Athena:** There's an element of what's fair to the owner, right? Like, so if it's just a, I'm worried about my own industry experience and my ability to run this, then you don't wanna necessarily penalize the owner for that. If there's variability or things that you're seeing in the numbers, then the performance networks, um, I would say the best way to de-risk.

Earlier on is to spend time learning as much as you can about the industry, seeing if you could find some experts to advise you or be an advisor to you. Go spend a day in the life and see if you feel like you'd be able to get up to speed and surround yourself with. People that can help educate you and or could you recruit somebody that has that experience that you can, you know, be managing the [00:40:00] business, the management, et cetera, the things you're good at, and then have a expert that you're able to bring in or account for.

And you look at the numbers and say like, does it still work? If I were to hire somebody that is that industry expert. I don't know exactly what the owners were doing, but like if it's like they're doing the logistics and all the ordering of the trucks and that sort of thing, then I would say the best way to mitigate that risk is hire somebody that knows how to do that.

**Jenny:** Yeah. They have like a key man who kind of runs it and it sounds like this guy is a little bit more removed. Op, like owner. Okay. He works like 30 hours a week. Um, 

**Athena:** so you are able to do performance notes on people. And like things around customer concentration or keyman or that sort of thing. So if this business would not be able to run if this person left right, because they're that integral to it, you can build in performance notes there and or build in a performance note and say with, you know, okay, [00:41:00] Mr.

Owner or Mrs. Owner in the first year, I want us to, uh, de de-risk. This one person and you help me identify and train somebody that can be a number two or an additional resource. So I'm not reliant on this one person. 

**Jenny:** Yeah. 

**Athena:** And that's how you help earn the performance note is that I successfully get someone in in place that has that industry knowledge and you help me do it.

So we're not dependent on this person. 

**Jenny:** Okay. I like that. I did. Include a performance note in my first offer, which I didn't really get much backlash on, so I'm probably just gonna keep 

**Athena:** it. But then in that case, I would make sure they understand it. 'cause sometimes you can put a performance note in and if they say no word about it, then my worry is, did they actually understand what that means and is that gonna come and bite me later?

**Jenny:** They did ask for a personal guarantee on it. That was all like, it was just their rebuttal. 

**Athena:** Personal guarantee if they 

**Jenny:** on the, per on, if the 

**Athena:** [00:42:00] metrics were met and, yeah, I think so. Yeah. Okay. I'd, I'd clarify. So they might just be thinking it's a seller note rather than dependent on performance of the business.

So I'd want clarify going into it. Like 

**Jenny:** it sounds like I should get on a call with the broker anyways, so I think we can chat that if I can catch him, which he's pretty available so. 

**Athena:** Phone, like phone Zoom, or in person's my favorite for negotiation, if at all possible, but definitely like getting on the phone and talking it through with someone.

I hate sending emails back and forth to Red Line a contract because then you just get in the weeds on points that it could have been a really easy, like, Hey, how important is this to you? Okay, cool. You know, so like, just tell me what's, what's super important to the seller in all of these points and what, what's not, and let's, let's find a way to get this done.

Because the broker wants the deal to close just as much as you do, right? Yeah. So they can become your buddy and, and help you get it over the line and you can collab with them on like what do you think is the sticking points, [00:43:00] what's really important and what's you just trying to be a good, you know, broker and get some of those things in?

With, um, with the PGS on, uh, seller notes, that is, that is something that, um, it will obviously be second in line to the bank. So the bank will get like, first their second in line, but it is, um, normal and you can limit it to the, you know, amount of liability. So they can't come after everything. It's the amount of the loan.

But that does come up sometimes that if you're taking out a sizable note that they want some guarantees that you're gonna. Pay it. 

**Jenny:** Yeah. And then how would I add a performance note on people? Is there like language or anything I can reference to help me with that? 

**Athena:** This is where, um, so when we go outside of what's in the template, this is where I like, recommend having a chat with Barlow Williams, um, and getting them, they will probably have done this before and no way in this specific, uh, um, [00:44:00] conversation or this specific situation on how to do keyman.

I've done customer concentration. I know that Keyman can done, be done. I haven't seen the language for it, so I'd, I'd recommend getting those guys to suggest some language to you. 

**Jenny:** Because I do think we have some sort of like keyman language in here, but it's not like tied to a note basically. Um, but I also feel like nothing is really binding until you come to a, you know, purchase agreement.

So this is just a starting point. 

**Athena:** Yeah, we, you wanna try to not. Negotiate it to the level of like having an LOI that could act as a purchase agreement. You know, it's like, yeah, let's in theory, like agree on some concepts, right? The mo, the main one being exclusivity. We like this kind of roundabout structure.

We know that there's some things that we might need to talk about after. Um, yeah, and that's another reason why I like a phone call. Yeah, because they're [00:45:00] withholding information, financials, all this other stuff that will give you so much more understanding of the business to be able to put these things on paper.

**Luke:** Yeah. 

**Jenny:** Cool. Is that helpful? Really helpful. Yeah. Thank you. 

**Athena:** Yeah, I'd be, I'd be, uh, like on the prowl for some advisors, I've seen folks like reach out to people in different, um, parts of the world where they're not necessarily a competitor and be like, Hey, can I do an interview with you, you know, to get some ex like industry knowledge or whatever, and.

And or doing a ride along with somebody or even these owners and, you know, jumping in and like spending a day in the life and seeing how far out of your depth you feel like it is. 

**Jenny:** Yeah, I care Found somebody last week who is like an expert in this industry, but I know I need to reach out to, so yeah.

**Athena:** When you, when you meet the, have you met the owners yet? 

**Jenny:** Only had a [00:46:00] phone call. 

**Athena:** Okay. Yeah. When you go and spend time with them too, or like, you know, even if it's after hours, so they don't alert the staff. I like seeing where I feel they're at and where I'm at. Like, I'm like, are we, I don't know if intellects the right word, but like, can I see?

Do I. Feel like they're just like, whoa. So far beyond where I could ever be. Yeah. Or with, with some mentoring and coaching from them, do I feel like they could get me up to where they're at? 

**Jenny:** You know? Yeah. 

**Athena:** Yeah. That's helpful. Awesome. Good stuff. You're doing great. It's, uh, it's very early days to have a lot of like complicated things.

You're handling it. Awesome. 

**Jenny:** Thank you. It's good to know. Thank you. 

**Athena:** Awesome. Okay. Michael, wanted to chat through your performance. It sounds like for roundabout on an offer, you got a performance note conundrum. So how are you feeling about that one? 

**Michael:** Yeah, I mean, pretty good. Um, there's, um, so this is, that's, that's, there's two, right?

You're talking about Moon Clerk? [00:47:00] Um, yeah, the first one, but, um, I, uh, I, there were. I proposed, uh, for a little bit of context setting in that we're short on time, but I, I proposed, uh, an offer sent it over and they countered back and they really weren't a fan of the performance notes. So they proposed a performance note that is $500,000 left, roughly, uh, than the one I proposed.

Proposed. So I actually called, um, 

**Cash:** the broker. I think it, I think it was just a seller's note, right? Like they didn't counter with a performance note. It was just a straight seller's note. 

**Michael:** Yeah. Uh, there was de that's a good point. It kind of depends on how you read the email. So I clarified that with John, the broker today.

But, um, he, he did seem comfortable with it being a performance note, um, 

**Athena:** right. 

**Michael:** And, and, um, and so what I, well anyway, had a conversation with him today about. What my concerns were and why the performance note was important and why the dollar amount was what it was. So [00:48:00] what we did was discussed a few options and he, uh, in this case actually, um, mentioned it before I did, which I thought was a good sign, but it was like one option was to just reduce the purchase price, uh, in lieu of us.

Smaller performance note because to me that by mitigating risk either way. Right. Um, with it. And so, um, the other thing that they had a concern on was the, the ability for the performance note to. Actually materialize a payout. Right? Um, so that one's just a little bit trickier because of where the state of the business is and the owner's, uh, interest level in taking action to help improve things.

Um, but um, but we talked through that as well and I said, well. I, I know that the SBA is gonna have guidelines or requirements around it needs to be a prior year or a [00:49:00] prior. The performance note needs to be based on a target that the company has hit previously. I don't know if they have the specification on a year end result, but, um, you know what, the performance note that I based it on was from a couple of years ago, which was a much higher revenue target and it maybe it could be reduced to go to last year.

Uh, you know, cut, uh, in layman's terms, just be a, a more recent time period. Um, that might make it a little more, uh, the, uh, palatable for the owner to think that it's realistic, right? Because he's looking at it as a possibly just writing off that mentally in his head that is not ever going to materialize.

And so did you 

**Athena:** do it as a Target or a prorata though? Like would he get paid a portion of it? Um, it was a prorata, 

**Michael:** but even, even then, you know, I had it set to where the revenue needed to, basically, I just set it to where, uh, whatever the trailing 12 months revenue was, it just didn't get worse. Right. So if it stayed flat, he would get it right.

But if it continued to decline, [00:50:00] he wouldn't. And so that was, I, I ba I just anchored it there. Um, and so he didn't really have too much concern on that. And then, but the, when it got to prior your targets, he's like, he didn't feel like he was gonna get to that number, and that's when I kind of put it back on him.

I'm like, but you're not taking any action to. Do anything about it. Right. So you're, you're sort of leaving that up to me or the buyer you choose to help, I didn't use this word, but really to help bail him out. Right. Um, so, um, but yeah, that was, that's sort of the update on, um, okay. On Moon clerk. And so he, it seemed to be, um, they were receptive to the idea of producing the purchase price overall.

And so that's what I told him. I said, I'll go back, I'll look at numbers again. Um, I'm, I hear what you're saying. I'm kind of in agreement with it, but don't wanna speak to anything on the phone call without running some numbers, but I can look at it and get back to you. Um, 

**Athena:** great. So 

**Michael:** yeah. So you sounds 

**Athena:** like you know what to do then, [00:51:00] or Yeah.

Do you wanna talk through anything with our few minutes that we have left that would, um. 

**Michael:** I, I don't think I have any specific questions on what to do there, um, specifically. Um, I may have some after I kind of dig in and run some numbers. Yeah, something may pop up. But, um, real quickly on the other one, um, just a quick status on that.

Um, I did meet with the broker and eventually the seller on rate liner, um, had a really good conversation with them. That's the, uh, freight, um. Uh, logistics transportation company in New Hampshire, but, um, had a good conversation with them. It's an owner that is really, wants to stay engaged and help with the transition.

Um, and the short version of that is the owner's expecting grandchildren, twins from his daughter any day now, and the broker is on vacation. I got that confirmed. I knew he was headed on vacation, so I would expect that activity and progress on, that's probably gonna. Be at a lull until [00:52:00] everybody kind of every comes, comes back from, um, things that were going on in their life.

So, um, but that's the update on them, and I know we're. I'll pause there 'cause we're right at time, but 

**Athena:** no good stuff. I rework the other one and, um, we, we can take a look at it and see if, uh, yeah. You know, you wanna a thought partner in, in reworking the numbers and the deal. Yeah, I 

**Michael:** might do that. Um, just real quick.

I mean, in one way my mentally, uh, like, hey, the numbers worked at 6.5 million. Right? The numbers should work at 6 million. Is the way that my logic on that is, um, at a purchase price. That is. But yeah, there's, um, you know, I think it's, that is one consideration. And the other is there's just some, some red flags on the business that I have to be willing to take on.

Right. It's, uh, not a lot of owner support and transition. Uh, the business has been in a state of decline. You're betting on the activities that you take to drive the, the change, um, are there, and it's just about. A comfort level [00:53:00] from me. Yeah. Willing to take, and, you know, with the skillset, I have to be able to take that on and, and course correct that, those, those areas in the business really quickly, 

**Athena:** right?

Mm-hmm. Yeah. So some, some internal, 

**Michael:** yeah. That's not a modeling conversations, it's more of a comfort and confidence level in what, in the plan you got to put together to, to make it happen. So, yeah. 

**Athena:** Love it. Well, sometimes I like to, you know, um, you heard Josh at the beginning, like he was like modeling worst case scenario.

What would I do? What decisions would I make? And I think that can be really helpful is spending some time in the worst case and like, well, what, what would I need to adjust and what would I do and what actions could I take or would I take if, if that were to be the case? And sometimes like planning for the worst case scenario actually makes you feel more confident.

**Michael:** Yeah, I actually have, uh, I'll, I'll be quick. I know for people that are wanna run on 'cause it we're, we're over. But, um, [00:54:00] I have a no change column, which is exactly what it says. No change, right? But, um, my best case actually assumes continued decline until I can take action to see some changes, right? So what I think some people, my ear, my earlier best case was, oh, let's grow it here, let's grow it there.

But. The really, the current trend line isn't supporting that. It's gonna be, all right, let's stop the decline and then grow. And that's, that's what I'm modeling on. A best case. Yeah. Worst case looks even uglier than that. But, um, but it, but, but the good thing is, um, you know, the cash flow is there, there's, you know, there's a.

A healthy business in those terms. Right. From a, from a margins and revenue. But it, it is just looking at it, it, it needs, it needs to be turned the other way. Right. It's not like it's, they're profitable, is what I'm saying. 

**Athena:** Awesome. Well, good stuff. Good conversations. Good, good deal. Things happening. Sorry I didn't get a chance to get around to everybody, but [00:55:00] always nice to see.

You all, and Marcos and Kyle, welcome as well. So we'll be able to put you on the hot seat soon. Um, and Steve and Polly, uh, cash filled me in on everything. Sounds like you have some good stuff going on, so would love to, um, catch up with you guys more on that soon. Um, everybody have a great rest of your day.

Thanks for joining. Um, I. I think we're gonna have to probably not have Thursday's session. I have a very injured, uh, shoulder going on right now and it looks like that's the only time I might be able to get an MRI on it. So I'm in excruciating pain, so please forgive me for having to cancel for personal reasons on Thursday.

Trying to see if I can find another time, but it was looking like that's the case. Uh, if you really want some Athena time though, I will be doing an Acquiring Minds webinar Thursday morning. Uh, you guys get all this information straight from the source on, on, uh, buyer, seller rapport and [00:56:00] relationships.

But it might be interesting to hear it all in one train of thought, or you can just have the day off from me shouting at you, whatever is your vibe. But we'll pull that video into the platform too, if you ever wanted to go and watch it. But just know you guys get it straight from the source through me and all the team here.

So, um, yes, and, uh, keep us posted on all your deals and the movement and stuff like that too, and we can go in and, and help you in the meantime, in the Slack channels. So thank you all, it's amazing to see you and we'll see you next time. Take care. Bye.
