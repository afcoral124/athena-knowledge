  Hey Luke, hey, how's it going?

0:17 - Luke Gillespie
  Good.

0:19 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Hey Ryan.

0:20 - Luke Gillespie
  Dude. Dude. Dude. It's I've never. I heard about it.

0:25 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  I've never actually seen it. It's amazing. I know. Anka puts so much work into that thing.

0:31 - Luke Gillespie
  don't even know if half of them know it's there. Yeah. We're such a small company. There's still so much that I'm not even involved in when I see it.

0:39 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  I'm surprised by what we've done. Yeah. you haven't gotten access to the resources. Tell Anka to give you a link to that resources page so you can see everything that the clients get.  Or if you think of anything that we should be adding on there. know, it's like, what can we give them to help them close?  you know so it's like the due diligence list is is such a pain in the  and getting it together and like what most people do is they go to their deal team deal team sends them a list and then they're compiling it all with this process it's like go to the deal team have them tell you which ones they want because like there's like five million names for a peanut like seriously it has like a million different names and then they'll and then our clients are like I don't know what to be getting you know it's crazy yeah but the problem with that so here's where I'd like to do tech in the future you know the areas where we're kind of falling down and like where you can potentially do like tech features but that DD list so the intention is that everybody gets access to it and they can access all those documents now the problem is is that lenders firewalls won't let them access google documents so even though all the deal team and everybody can be on that master list the  Unders can't access it. So the clients still have to hand upload, like literally everything to the lenders with their portal, rather than the lender just going in and grabbing what they need from that list.

2:13 - Luke Gillespie
  Interesting. Wow.

2:16 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah. Future future tech solution we can come up with. First, I just want to get a modeling spreadsheet that like has all the things in it.

2:27 - Luke Gillespie
  So.

2:30 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  That's what we got to really good. There's, well, there's three people that I'm talking to about doing the modeling and doing new like modeling, but she's for clients, but.  So yeah, anyways, cool. How's going? How are we looking final week?

2:52 - Luke Gillespie
  I can give you an update on deals on looking at following that report if you would like. Cool. Yeah.  All right. I'll share my screen.

3:01 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Oh, let me give you access. Here we go.

3:04 - Luke Gillespie
  There you go All right, so currently as I go through the stages I have SP right here It's the title foundation contractor and waterproofing specialist They basically they like waterproof basements things like that in kind of Georgia, North Carolina South Carolina All those hurricane stormy areas.
  SCREEN SHARING: Luke started screen sharing - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/220530680?timestamp=188.262163  I have a call for that business on Thursday. hoping it works out It's it's really one of those really high EBITDA businesses.  So I it looks like a really good business. It's kind of a larger sized business So hopefully that'll work out for SP Oh, this is the vending machine company I'm still working on for Jason, but it looks like the brokers on vacation So I'm kind of putting that one to the side.
  ACTION ITEM: Complete write-up for Jason's home remodeler deal - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/220530680?timestamp=214.9999  This is a home remodeler I just got off the call with the broker right before buyers club I'm gonna do it right up for this after we end this call.  So we got Jason covered 100% so that's good And then D H then This is a commercial, it's a pressure-washing business in Jacksonville.  It looks like it could be a good fit for BH. broker hasn't gotten back to me, but unfortunately, I've been focusing on our other priority clients before BH, so I'm going to plan on hopefully giving this broker a ring tomorrow.

4:17 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Did we look at the two deals that he sent through on Slack?

4:22 - Luke Gillespie
  Yes, we created deals for those. One Ida is horrifying and skinny in our pipeline, and then I'm going to push those both out for the write-ups as soon as possible.

4:31 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay, maybe respond to him in Slack and let him know that we've actioned those, because he sent a message and he's like, I'm requesting information on both of these and it didn't look like anyone from the team responded to him on that thread.

4:44 - Luke Gillespie
  Ryan, you did, right?

4:47 - AcquiMatch Team
  Yeah, I did.

4:50 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  He posted another one though, so I don't know if you've seen it, because I saw the thread where you said that, and then he posted another message and he's like, these are the ones that I'm blah, blah, on.  So yeah, I did, I sent a message as thanks for getting on this. Okay. Yeah, it was in the main thread where you said I'm, I'm submitting a or I'm requesting information on this and that.

5:14 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah, yeah, right. got to that.

5:17 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay.

5:19 - Luke Gillespie
  Okay. Next, I have another age deal. It's an online like education company, but they forgot what they taught on.  But it's another, it's a bigger company online. And I'm also doing a broker call on that on Thursday. I can click into the deal if you want to take a closer look at it.  But that's, that was the summary.

5:40 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay. And he's, he's, it sounds like he's more open to online businesses. That's the last one that he looked at.

5:48 - Luke Gillespie
  And this one is one of those more of those teaching education businesses, which you said he has a lot of experience with.  So I'm, we're hoping he would, he would like it more.

5:58 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay, cool. How are we looking otherwise? is in local businesses for him.

6:03 - Luke Gillespie
  Oklahoma, I don't have anything in Oklahoma. I do have a metal fabricator located in DFW, but they do some work in Oklahoma, and I'm getting more details on that.

6:15 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay.

6:17 - AcquiMatch Team
  And then I'm also working in off-market form, but it's going pretty slow. seller is engaging me. It's an age factor of $2 million a year of revenue, so it has potential, but he's going, he's taking his time.  it just may take some time to get a tournament to lead.

6:35 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay. then what we've gotten him the minimum number of deals this month, is that right?

6:42 - AcquiMatch Team
  Yes.

6:43 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay. And then what about the Facebook guy we got in anything from that?
  ACTION ITEM: Follow up w/ Facebook campaign lead generator on progress - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/220530680?timestamp=405.9999

6:52 - AcquiMatch Team
  Nothing else yet.

6:54 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay. Have you not got checked in on that? It's supposed to be, we're supposed to be getting leads by this point.

7:00 - AcquiMatch Team
  Correct. I can get with her on that and see where we're at didn't discuss that today.

7:05 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay, because he's just doing Andrews, but we were supposed to be getting, I think he said like three to five days or five to seven days.

7:12 - AcquiMatch Team
  So I will get with her on that.

7:16 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Cool. Yeah, let's uh, and then have we, I can't remember where we left it. And if it was a ball, I dropped because I got sick, but in terms of letting him know that we're spending extra money and trying out pulling out all the stops to try to get him deals.  Have we told him that? Is that something that was supposed to come from me? I can't remember where we left it.

7:37 - AcquiMatch Team
  Sorry, can you beat that?

7:38 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Just in terms of we talked about letting him know that we're pulling out all the stops spending extra money to try to store some stuff.  I couldn't remember if that was something that was supposed to come from me or not. Like I dropped a few balls while I was sick, or have we let him know that we're doing that sort of thing?

7:57 - AcquiMatch Team
  Yeah, no, that was me. I did all I did all that. Bye. I gave him everything we got.

8:02 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay, so he knows we're trying all sorts of different things that we're not doing for any other client.

8:08 - AcquiMatch Team
  It does.

8:09 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay, did that seem to make him feel better or where are we temperature check with Andrew in general?

8:20 - AcquiMatch Team
  He definitely appreciated it, he's a super nice guy, I mean everything I tell, thanks Ryan, thanks so much, great job on this, right?  He's just very positive, another very good energy, and I'm like, look, man, I want to get you a business, you know, that you get an alloy under, so, you know, I think you're completely capable and we want to get you something, we've got working with you, so, you know, I'm going to get you some online businesses and just try to get you a volume Luke's going to look for businesses that maybe you could just consider getting an upgrade in there, we're just going to start throwing more volume with you, and you just kind of get back to us if it's a fit or not, you know, we can give you more, just like teasers, or what was the way you phrased  said, temperature checks, he was like, OK, so yeah, that's good. That sounds good to me. So you guys can do that, and I'll tell you, and you guys can decide if want to help all work into it.  So I said, OK, we can do that. So where you sent them a couple online businesses, one we sent was pretty good.  Luke founded on Fireflippers. I went in there and looked at it, said, oh, this is good. And presented it to him, set up a call to go over with him, and it went under a lot.  So I think he was asking to pull the trigger, the $4 million online business, he's like, oh, that's big for me.  So but I think it's good that we got him something that made him get a call where we walk through all the pulp, think I like about it, so he got to see how I think about some internet-based businesses.  We have another one right now, like a smaller content site. I'm going to send that to him as well.  looks like a pretty good business. I don't know if he'd be able to use SBA on it, but it's possible.

10:00 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay. Yeah, let's check in with this Facebook campaign and see where we're at with that.

10:09 - AcquiMatch Team
  So, just an update there, because when you start talking, I just checked on my order if you sent this email yet.  So, he said, we've gotten a few leads, but well under the revenue threshold. So, we have made some additional adjustments that are looking forward to seeing others come through.  Keep in mind, it's only been a week and we never know how each campaign will penetrate the market. It takes some time to adjust.

10:34 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay. Cool. Is there anything else we can do on that front? We've doubled the leads, haven't we, for the off market?

10:47 - AcquiMatch Team
  Yes.

10:49 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  And nothing is coming through there in terms of like opportunities either.

10:54 - AcquiMatch Team
  Nothing now. We have to take track, but nothing now.

10:57 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay. Okay. Okay. Oh, that's frustrating. If we can crack these areas, I've got another client and potentially signing on Thursday, he's an Arkansas, like these rural areas, if we can crack these, then we'll really be onto something.

11:16 - Luke Gillespie
  So, yeah, you might have to just extra focus on off market for those areas. Yeah, I mix handwritten letters or something.  I mean, I can take an accident on the call or something.

11:32 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  I'm excited to see what Brian comes up with. I know you and Anka met with Brian.

11:41 - AcquiMatch Team
  How'd that go? Yeah, he seems pretty cool. We'll see how it works.

11:46 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, I think that will be like direct mail. Also, when we get big enough, can just hire people to run around in t-shirts, like what Mike's doing with the towing company.  It's like, sell me your towing business, you know? just like have brand ambassadors on the ground in these areas just running around with so many your business.
  ACTION ITEM: Finish write-up for Andrew's remote work business before month-end - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/220530680?timestamp=725.9999  We dream. We're going to figure this out. Cool. Nice work. right. Carry on, Luke.

12:16 - Luke Gillespie
  Yes, man. Next I have this is that diesel repair shop that I've been talking about since last week. I talked to the phone call on Friday.  I submitted my questions and they just gave me access to further information that they said should answer most of my questions.  So I'm going to take a look at that. And these guys don't really do broker calls. They just need to send your questions over email.  So maybe I'll just turn this into a write up or I'll ask some further questions. I was going to talk with Ryan about this tomorrow morning further.  And then that. remote works in my absentee 25 hours a week. And he's Very much remote. He's always traveling.  He's in the Bahamas right now. They have they built out a big team They have like a million dollars to even dust so it's uh should be good fit for Andrew.

13:10 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Great. Who's the broker on that?

13:12 - Luke Gillespie
  Talon , it's a TK ventures. They're This they're a Christian brokerage are the ones I told you about the call on Friday.  They don't do a commission.

13:22 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  They do a success fee Huh, yeah Nice guys Yeah, cool. Do you think that could be a write-up by the end of the before the end of the month?

13:37 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah, I Hope so. I've been trying to do a write-up on it for like a week now, but I'm just to get more information They're very responsive when I called them.  So I'm gonna review this extra information. We got Maybe I'll ask them extra questions tomorrow and I mean worst case scenario We'll have enough to do a write-up because I did a short call with main broker and he gave me some insights into the the seller and who They are and what they're looking for

14:00 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  or so. Does it feel like it might be a good one for Andrew?

14:03 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah, I like it. Oh, great.

14:06 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay. Awesome. That's right.

14:07 - Luke Gillespie
  This is the one I've been excited about for like a week and a half. I've been telling Ryan, I've just been engine every day trying to get closer to a ride off.

14:15 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Let's let's try to get it before the end of the month because it's the first of the month when Andrew starts questioning.  Has is the existential like do I continue or not?

14:24 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah, yeah.

14:24 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So I'm playing it again.

14:26 - Luke Gillespie
  That's out by the end of the week.

14:27 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So don't agree. Excellent.

14:30 - Luke Gillespie
  Next is this exact brokerage. This is the one I told you it's it's a metal fabricator structural steel company in DFW.  But they do some work in Oklahoma. And again, just during the bias of meeting, I got extra access to the data room.  So I'm gonna have to take another look. I'll talk about this with Ryan tomorrow. I'll have an update for you by Thursday.  And then yeah, this is that little one that I did the right up on. That's yeah, that's all I have to talk about for all of our priority clients this week.  Yeah. So in summary, if you remember, we're looking like we got some pretty good progress. Can I have a write-up for Jason?  So he's contractually minimum. SPI have like two deals already for them. So that should be good. AH, you see I have a lot for them.  So that should be good. BH, I have that one pressure-washing business. Hopefully it'll turn out. But yeah, BH is kind of on our lower priority right now because we're focusing on these other guys.  But JB right now, we just, I have nothing for JB. I recycled through our priority deals, taking a look at that.  And there's a couple, like, we always say 70 percenters, maybe they're like 60 percent, 50 percenters. I'm going to talk to Ryan about them tomorrow.  Maybe we could push for write-up. But other than that, his deal flow has been horrible. Just I don't see anything for JB and Tampa area.
  ACTION ITEM: Push out 50-60% match deal for JB to meet monthly minimum - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/220530680?timestamp=945.9999

15:50 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  How many have we gotten him this month?

15:52 - Luke Gillespie
  JB won the off-market of the age back that he's working on right now.

15:56 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Let's push a 50 percenter out then this month. So we're at least hitting the minimum. Um, he's going to be focused on this off market, but it's good for them to have gut checks even still.  And anything you can do that, push out, like, is one of those 50 or, okay, Laura, you and Ryan chat about those.  But let's, let's, it's good for them to have just gut checks and feel those deals coming through, right? Like, so he knows that there's other opportunities out there.  If this one ends up not freaking out or, you know, the big swing in the, that you've done and that sort of thing.

16:30 - Luke Gillespie
  yeah. And even like 40 chests, know, maybe Joe's kind of disappointed that the SD dropped.
  ACTION ITEM: Schedule call w/ BH re: deal status & recent engagement - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/220530680?timestamp=991.9999

16:36 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  But then maybe if we show him a business that's not that great, he's going to value this HVAC one a lot better.  Good point. Just on BH really quick, he's engaging all of a sudden. So I'm wondering what's happening because he's looking for businesses again.  So did his other deal fall apart or like his temperature has changed towards deal sourcing all of a sudden?

16:58 - Luke Gillespie
  Good point, right? I Take you saw on the channel Athena. did he rejected the cigar lounge He doesn't want that but he wants to get on a call with the the gas station breakers Right, but he's also sending over listings.

17:11 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So he's looking himself.

17:13 - Luke Gillespie
  So something's happened Yeah When's the last time you chatted with him Ryan?

17:20 - AcquiMatch Team
  Last week last Tuesday Yeah Yeah Yeah, I mean I Guess you could say that with those two listings that is about you bring that up.  I did interesting He Didn't I do anything like that we discussed from my last call So It's hard to it's kind of a little like trying to go Hold on You know, we set up a call where I could copy.  Hey, this is what we need from you. What do you think of these business? says and didn't seem like he had removed them so I had to kind of go over that with them on the call and be like hey take your time go through these on your own and get back to me within 24 hours with your all your questions of concerns on each business and we'll set up calls with rumors because as I can you do that was for me 24 hours because I kept letting do that it ever saw him I responded to him after 24 hours so it made a third like not full of 36 hours but a day and a half later and I said hey where are we at that never got back to the whole week he never got back to the bottom again uh and when I did he said the same question he did like two weeks ago which I already covered that completely with him so he didn't he's not taking any of the seriously um so I kind of just went right back on me like hey we need this um and  That's when he threw in those listings in there. So we know I created deals for those ASAP, got you to create deals on those ASAPs because, you know, whatever.  you say, hey, we want this, that's fine. But in terms of why he's looking for those, instead of just actually looking at the deals that we've presented to him, I'm not sure.  I would say he's probably not doing a good job of reviewing the write-ups. He brought up the oil spill issue.  He's like, hey, I'm concerned with that. I'm like, let's go and talk about it. We talked through it and I was like, we need to get you on a call with a broker.  Just at least talk and dive into it with your questions. So we put together some questions, like add on operational questions here.  Send them to me. I'll do the talk track for you. We'll get you on the call. And they'll respond.  And then when I fill it out, we'll be like, what about that oil spill out? Do that. We already talked about this, so, yeah, he's kind of just the same way he's been, which is just kind of all over the place.  I just need to like. Yeah, get on the same page as us.

20:28 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Let me, let me think about it. Because if he continues to. Like not. Engage the way he should, then, then.  I need to address that, but in the meantime, it might be worth reaching out to him and asking what's happening with this other deal and be like, hey, sounds like you're looking at listings again is something changed with your deal.  Just like a general check in. And then, so where did you leave it with again? Now station, you're scheduling a conversation.

21:04 - AcquiMatch Team
  Yeah, we're going to just schedule a broker call, but I was like, Hey, give me a list of your questions first.  That's what I first instructed to do. so we can talk through them so I can kind of get his, you know, get nice idea of how he thinks of things.  So he just responded with like a, like a two sentence paragraph. So showing that he didn't look through anything.

21:40 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Right. Okay. So I would just go back to him and be like, Hey, you need to spend more time preparing for this.  not going to put you on a burger call unprepared. You're going to have to be like teacher on that, you know, like, but don't, don't.  Do his work for him. Don't do his homework for him.

22:02 - AcquiMatch Team
  Yeah, you know Yeah, like I said like Two calls would be from his bed, right? was in his bed.  told you about that and then the last call He didn't have his video on but at one point. I was talking I passed Do you know what I'm saying?  And he didn't say anything. I was like Brian. He's like, yeah, yeah, and I was like He's not listening to me Right So he's like super nice guy and cool.  like I think but he's not taking it seriously If he feels like I kind of feel like he feels like I thought this business.  I throw away this money To already hear now. I'm not sure what I should do about it He's like maybe he's thinking about other things and it doesn't seem like he's fully focused on this seems like it's like I

23:00 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  call them and and say that. Like just be like, hey, Brian, I've not had this much trouble with any of the other clients.  I know you had the thing where you were buying this other business. It doesn't really feel like you're invested in this.  Like, however you feel like about this, you know, like, it's not our it's not to our benefit to try to try to develop these relationships.  So like, but what we can do is support you on on this business or talking through funding or strategy or all of it.  So like, how can we be of support to you? But it is not, you know, it's it's this isn't working.  It doesn't feel like you're invested in this. And me and the team spend a lot of time. And also it puts our broker relationships in a in a not good place if you're not engaging with them and stuff.

23:50 - AcquiMatch Team
  like, what's on? I would I would just call them out on it. Yeah, honestly. Yeah, that's what I'm gonna do.  Okay, I'm gonna get them on a call them off.

23:58 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  do that.

24:00 - AcquiMatch Team
  Uh, okay, um, some relatable this will segue to, um, a, a, she's still saying she's not feeling good. Um, with the brokers that we did make introductions for, um, I have, like, you know, reached out to them and say, Hey, like, sorry, she's not feeling well.  She's, you know, that's about this. She's but she's so interested and just want to check in and make sure the businesses were still available so that she's feeling into it.  I can reach out to you. They both said businesses are still available. I said, thank you. so at least know that there's something going on there.  Um, we have those like on a pause. Um, but in terms of introducing new businesses, I want to get your thoughts.

24:43 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  What do you think is the player?

24:46 - AcquiMatch Team
  Yeah, I don't think we should introduce anything new to her until she's like giving us the go ahead. I mean, we messaged her.  She goes, I can try. Or she goes, I can sure try. So that's not like, that's not giving me much.
  ACTION ITEM: Set up call w/ AH to discuss concerns & next steps - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/220530680?timestamp=1500.9999  confidence. And this is a small area, like it's Minnesota, it's not like there's, if she wait eight inches, there's the only four brokers there and she doesn't move on it.  Well, they're not going to take her serious going forward. So, um, maybe I should, you know, ask them to say, so sorry, I wanted to get in the floss because she sent this few hours ago.  I wanted to say sorry to hear about, you know, some issues she's having going through. Um, I know you're busy tomorrow on Thursday, but how about we set a call between me and you on Friday and then catch up and see what you're, what you're feeling up to?

25:36 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, I think that's good. And then, and then you can tell her like, Hey, we don't recommend engaging on businesses if, if you're not able to, because everything you just said, right?  It's a really small market. There's very few brokers. We don't want to engage on something if you're not ready to kind of move forward.  So if you're not feeling up to it, But I don't I don't want the team to engage businesses because we're we're going to lose the opportunity to do that down the line, you know, so yeah, I think that's like if she's not able to move these conversations forward.  It's not to her benefit for us to be sending her over deals because it could burn her chances if she genuinely is sick and and still wants to buy a business.  It's like we shouldn't wait until you're ready because you need to be able to have these conversations and movies forward.  So we burn these bridges with the very few brokers in your area.

26:39 - AcquiMatch Team
  Okay, but yeah, if you get on a call, are you feeling up to?

26:43 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  We don't want to push anything on you, but also like, how are you feeling about the process? know, like, is it genuinely like a sick thing or is she hiding is she afraid and hiding behind the sick thing?  So I think you just try to. You know, be like, before you got sick, I felt like you were a little bit concerned about the financial modeling.  So how are you feeling about all that? know, like you can say, like, I know you got sick, but where we left it off, there was some fear.  So how are you feeling once you're feeling better? you feeling ready to kind of take this on? Do you need additional support?  How are you feeling overall? Once we do pick up again with, know, the next steps and where you need to do that.  And maybe you'll be able to kind of determine what's fear versus, and she's like, no, I'm like so ready to dive into the  spreadsheets, I can't wait, then it genuinely is a sick thing, right?  Maybe you can be like, so before you got unwell, like this is where we were at. So how are you overall feeling about the process, you know?  And then maybe you can get some truth.

27:51 - AcquiMatch Team
  Yeah, I think I need to like put myself in for shoes of being like, you know, if I was more you're scared about this than if I would like.  How open I would be to telling the people I have more for me that I'm not sure anymore, so or maybe I'm just really scared and just talking here with through that, I think that's a good idea.

28:16 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, and you can say like, you know, everybody gets scared of this bread sheets and I know you were feeling a little apprehensive about it, but like then you got unwell, so we don't know, you know, really like where do you need the support next, like what is the next thing that's holding you back and how can we help you, you know, overcome the next challenge that you're facing.  So I think if you just alleviate like concerns, like everybody gets, gets concerned, but what we didn't know was how to navigate with you, what's, what's genuinely illness and where do we need to push and coach and support you through the next parts of the process.

28:52 - AcquiMatch Team
  Okay, great. And then the next one kind of cycling into the next one. You're making this much bigger of a deal than this, she's like, okay, I was like, just half the conversation, there's plenty of lender out there, but half the conversation and start now and we already are running into roadblocks because we don't have that letter.  So we can't be getting more deals unless you get that done. She's like, okay, I'll get on that. So hopefully she'll get that SBA letter.  She really likes the business look, the power washing business. She wants to start thinking about she's comparing the two Amco and that.  So I said, put together business plans for both, right? Like, I was reading through some stuff about what lenders are going to look at and they have like these business plans they want.  So I was like, just start drafting those yourself, like side by side, like, here's my marketing plan, here's my operations plan so that you can visualize side by side what's more you, right?  So she's kind of the start of like bouncing back and forth. which one she should actually go for. So I was like, put model both of them out, put both of them side by side, write them up and you can see which one can see yourself more.  So that's what she's going to do and then we scheduled a call where she's going to go all overall, when she came up with me on Thursday.  third thing, going to go over both of those things. But anyway, she liked that business loop, so that's good.

31:24 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Awesome. When she models it both out, the numbers are going to tell a story, right? It's a free cash flow left on both of them, you know, and the overall size and the amount of effort, you know, like one she has to replace two owners, the other one, probably not.  So when you have numbers in front of you, you're able to remove the emotion from the conversation, you know, just compare numbers to numbers, right?  So perfect plan sounds good. I figured it was in the D.U.

31:53 - AcquiMatch Team
  I knew she was  stalling on the SBA letter.

31:57 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  I had a D.U.I. Everyone has a D.U.I.

32:00 - Luke Gillespie
  like... It's fine.

32:01 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Like, just do it. We are checked too and told her it was fine. So like, yeah, good. So she knows she's not getting any more deals until she does that.

32:16 - AcquiMatch Team
  Yeah, exactly. Yeah. She's like, I'll get that done. So she knows she's bugger. It's in her head, right? she's bugging her too.  So yeah, I get it.

32:26 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  mean, God, mine was almost 20 years ago. it's like, it's embarrassing. But honestly, like, they're not concerned about that, especially if it was a really long time ago.  If it was last year, then then they might be like, what's going on? You're like an adult doing this kind of crap.

32:42 - AcquiMatch Team
  But when you're in your twenties, like, yeah, exactly.

32:46 - Luke Gillespie
  And I mean, I don't even know what would you guys do if you didn't have Uber back then? I don't even know how you.

32:52 - AcquiMatch Team
  That's the thing. have to drive.

32:56 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  You know, there was no tax.

33:00 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah. There's there's no taxis.

33:02 - AcquiMatch Team
  There is there every day with a complete adventure, like a risk assessment of what you can do. How much you were going to have to pay in parking to leave your car overnight?

33:14 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Because you drive there and then it's like, OK, well, I'm going to go $100 ticket. If I don't move my car by six a.m.  the next day, I was in LA and like, if you called the taxi, you'd wait for three hours in hopes that they were going to get there.  Nobody took the bus because it was like dangerous, right? And there was no Uber. So yeah, it was like, everybody had a DUI because there was no options back then.  Now if you get a DUI, when there's Uber, it's like, what the hell are you doing? You know, like that is unacceptable.  But like, when I was when I was your age, we didn't have it was like, yeah, the risk assessment of like, how many drinks have I had versus how much is the ticket going to be versus my car going to get toned versus how far away from home and my

34:00 - AcquiMatch Team
  He was always this guessing game of like, you drank a bar, and then you just drank waters Hoping like to you like I feel good Right your friends would be like are you and then they would there be this conference like no you're fine Like no, not good.

34:16 - Luke Gillespie
  need to wait longer You can just sit in your car. It was that is every time you went out to drink It's crazy.

34:23 - AcquiMatch Team
  So you either either had a DUI or you had multiple stories of how you almost got a DUI Survive not getting a DUI.

34:31 - Luke Gillespie
  That's how well that's back though Getting questionable rides like me my girlfriends used to hang out at this one bus stop We were guaranteed to be offered rides, you know, like Totally safe for a bunch of like young women to do Oh, man.

34:47 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Hey, you guys are crazy It was wild time like thank god for technology, you know Yeah, everybody back then had it  I got it. I was so ashamed. I remember I was like crying to the police officer. And I was like, I do that.  And my whole story was like, I got stuck at a concert that was in the middle of nowhere thinking I was gonna like meet up with my roadie friends, because that was back when I toured.  And we took some shots like right when the night was over and then I was planning on hanging out with them for a couple hours after the show because their bus wasn't leaving until like three in the morning.  But then they never came back and I was like, what the hell? And it turns out one of them broke their foot during loadout and they all went to the hospital.  So I'm just sitting there waiting and I was like, okay, well now I have to, I was like, I just took it.  So maybe if I get my car drive home now, it'll be before it like sets in, but it was in Ventura County.  So like 45 minutes away from the concert venue, there's no taxis, nothing out there. I was by myself. So I took the risk.  I got all the way to my sister's house. And then I I decided I was hungry and I went looking for food.  And that's when they pulled me over and I was like crying to the police officer. I was like, I thought you're responsible.  I can't believe I did this. And he's like, you're not a bad person. You made a bad choice.

36:13 - Luke Gillespie
  And I was like, but I feel like a bad person.

36:16 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  It was just horrible.

36:18 - AcquiMatch Team
  know, but like that whole thing changed my life for the better.

36:22 - Luke Gillespie
  I'm actually really grateful it happened.

36:24 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  And, you know, it was a lot of money and a lot of stress. But. Yeah, that's for you.

36:32 - AcquiMatch Team
  That's why you stopped drinking.

36:34 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  No, actually, well, I did for the rest of my time in LA because I ended up doing like this whole like candid diet and everything.  And then I moved to London and I didn't have to drive. So it was like a very different situation over there.  But this was almost 20 years ago when I got the DUI. then I stopped drinking six years ago.

36:59 - Luke Gillespie
  Ryan, have you had a DUI?

37:00 - AcquiMatch Team
  But I have stories.

37:06 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Free Uber, like life. Yeah, was wild. like our parents, they didn't do DUIs, you know, like in the 70s.  It's like they just drove drunk. Like it wasn't, it wasn't like the DUIs. It was driving, of course.

37:23 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah, it's crazy.

37:25 - AcquiMatch Team
  It Anyways, let's just, the last ones for me to touch on. Probably the only one is just Gil. You know, I have an off-market schedule with him.  Then for me, he's going, well, I'm like, that's going right. And he is like, he is so concerned about the space.  He's like, he wants me to call it off. I'm like, this is going fine. He's like something's wrong. Something's wrong here.  You gotta tell me what's wrong. I can't identify. like, I don't know what's But it is, but something, something's, they're the red, siren going off my head or something.  I'm like, I'm not getting that. So, then I did a call today to kind of get prepped for it.  it is, was like trying to show me guys this and this. I'm like, this is all normal stuff. you have to ask about this on the call.  And he's like, look, I don't want to waste this time. don't want to waste your time. I don't want to waste my time.  Like, I did not accept that. I'm like, no, we're doing this call. Like, this is fine. You need to ask him all these questions.  You're saying all these questions, but really the answers you have to ask them. So he's kind of at that stage right now.  This is his very first one, right? He's kind of feeling scared that if he goes further, he's going to be obligated to make an offer and I'm telling him that's not the way it works.  It's fine, but you can't, you're making a decision not to continue before we even know the answers to your questions.  And also, remember, at the end of your life, he's like, he's getting an off market, he doesn't that he doesn't.  He's like, he's acting like another one in the couple of next week. So, it's been a challenge in there, but I'm just going to keep pressing forward.  I think after the call, he's going to feel good, but he's just getting nervous beforehand. So, I got a call He's never, he's never had an owner conversation.

39:27 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So, that's probably the thing that's terrifying him and part of the things that came up in the sales process is like knowing how to have those conversations and being confident when he has those conversations and that sort of thing.  So, it might be a confidence kind of thing.

39:44 - AcquiMatch Team
  Yeah, he's got a broker seller call tonight. That's good. Great. He only is good at 30 minutes. So, I'm guessing it's more of an intro call, but he's prepared for that.  And then, yeah, off market on Friday. So, that's pretty much it. That's for our guy.

40:00 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, keep, keep at him, you know, and just keep reminding him like this is part of the process. You need to get your reps in, you know, like, and just throw it back to acquiring minds like you've listened to all this stuff.  You know, you have to get your reps and having these conversations is how you get your reps. So you're, even if you don't move forward on the business, this is a learning process, you're going to learn and you're going to be more confident when the right one comes.  If you feel like you need me to swoop in and have a come to Jesus with him to comment down, like, I'm available for that.  Sounds like you've got it all under control, but if you need me to have a like, Hey, Gil. Trust my team.  Trust the process. It's okay. We gotcha. Nothing. Nothing is going to, like, you're not going to bankrupt yourself by having conversations.  It's all good. So that's, if you need it, it's available. We can, we can do that. But it sounds like you are doing all the right things.

40:55 - AcquiMatch Team
  Yeah, we'll that.

40:57 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  I believe in that. And also, So yeah, for him to have an off market as his first one of all people, you know, it's like with a Joe or Chris that wouldn't be concerned because they have that like confidence to be able to have those conversations.  think Gil is, it's the conversation part that that scares him. And you know, people liking him and taking him seriously and all of that.

41:22 - AcquiMatch Team
  Yeah. Yeah. He's also very, he's an analytical guy, so he's a little great analyzing things. He doesn't realize that you don't know anything until you actually have a conversation with the seller.  All of this is just information, words for you to use, but don't use this as like not to have a call.  That's just, that's not how it works. If he has to figure that out yet, but hopefully by the end of this you will.

41:50 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Great. Good job. All right.

41:52 - AcquiMatch Team
  Cool.

41:53 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  You all are doing amazing. It's very exciting. We've got new client Destin joined today. Okay, so we were letting them into buyer's blood after we get their like deal box and investor profile in.  So you're going to be seeing Justin soon too. So just giving them something to do and for them to absorb and that sort of thing.  So Lindsey and Dustin will be starting on the first.

42:18 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah, I listened to their onboarding call. They seem like a nice couple. I'm looking forward to finding business for them.  And they're in a good area. So we'll find a lot of deals for them.

42:26 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, they remind me a lot of Lindsey and Kevin. I like how they interact with each other. And I think yeah, that's that's where Lindsey and Kevin were really good is they were able to talk to each other and get them out of each other's head.  That's a benefit of having like a couple, you know. So like, but they're going to put us under the gun too.  They did a lot of follow up meetings with me, a lot of scrutinizing.

42:47 - Luke Gillespie
  That's okay. You know, we're good at what we do. Yeah, and great job, Ryan. You're doubling as a vetting director and part-time therapist with our client.

42:56 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  That's the job. I told Ryan that's what it's like. Like and I tell people that on the sales calls and like half of what we do is getting you out of your own way like You know even even Joe today, it's like the piano changes and I'm like Joe.  They're gonna change like five more times, right? gill it was so funny like I love his enthusiasm and how attentive he is but It was we got on his first run up and he had a panic attack he wrote down like a five-page document and I I was reading it just like kind of laughing like all right, it's gonna have fun with this one I think it more confident though, you know, it's it's It's it's it's interesting how much like fear and You know like mindset stuff comes into this and the more that we do this the more clients that we work with the more I realize like this is what everybody else is missing in this industry that supporting buyers is they are not addressing  Yes, you know, which is a very real part of the process.

44:04 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah.

44:05 - AcquiMatch Team
  Well, they say like totally saying why I can't believe people do this on their own. Like it's that much, especially if you're working with them.

44:16 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah, I see it on right here at Broker calls every day, like the value that we bring because all these brokers will say, oh, we had this one guy, he was in contract, but I didn't do my due diligence on him.  He didn't actually have the heck the liquid caster. He said, oh, he got cold feet, he pulled out or yeah, blah, blah, like, I sell them like, oh, our clients have this, this, this, they know how to do all of it.  know, so I see the value that we provide. Yeah, and they'll feel that the more that like an experienced buyers are coming to it and we're turning up and we're like, no, we're going to, we're going to hold their hand and we're going to be there to make sure that they, you know, have support by their side to use that they don't just like you do for the seller, like we're there for the buyer, you know, because it's scary.  It's, of course, it's scary to buy a multi-million dollar. business. That's They're putting their whole  livelihood on the line, their retirement accounts, their homes, like a course they're going to be terrified.  Yeah, it makes sense.

45:09 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  be worried if they weren't.

45:12 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah.

45:13 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Then we get like the Brian's who's just like, let me just throw out money at things. Anyways, nice work YouTube.  I'm excited for insurance due diligence. That is, it's something that I had no idea existed. It's actually really fascinating.  So that should be a fun one. So yeah, and then we'll, looks like we're shaping up good for the month.  So well done. Most clients ever. Great start to the year. three people making offers right now.

45:43 - Luke Gillespie
  It's  awesome. Yep.

45:46 - AcquiMatch Team
  Awesome.

45:47 - Luke Gillespie
  I'm going with Jason tomorrow morning. Hopefully I'll finish it today.

45:52 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Nice work. Well, give me shot. If you need anything, I'm at that event all day tomorrow, but I'll see you guys again on Thursday and great work.  Alright, good. Thank you. Bye guys. Thanks. Bye.
