# How to Use This Document {#how-to-use-this-document}

This document is your roadmap for navigating the pre-LOI process and beyond. It provides step-by-step guidance on preparing your offer, structuring it correctly, and working with us to ensure a successful acquisition. As a first-time buyer, you’ll need to focus on timing, competition, and having a strong offer that aligns with financing and seller expectations. Here’s how to use this guide effectively, along with how we’ll support you throughout the process.

## Key Tips Before You Begin:

1. **Know the Timings and Competition**  
   Before submitting your offer, get a clear understanding from the broker about their process. Are they accepting the first strong bid or fielding multiple offers and deciding later? This insight is crucial to shaping your strategy. We’ll help you tailor your offer based on their timeline, ensuring your approach aligns with how they’re handling bids.

2. **Leverage Early Dialogue**  
   If there’s an opportunity for dialogue with the seller or broker before submitting your offer, take it. This is your chance to address key details, such as contingencies, seller financing, working capital and other terms, early on, giving you a competitive edge. We’ll guide you through these discussions to ensure you’ve covered critical points, minimizing potential delays later in the process.

3. **Work with Us Throughout the Process**  
   At every step, from financial modeling to structuring your offer and reviewing documents, we’re here to support you. Use us to review your financial model, help you fine-tune your offer, and navigate any complexities. When you're ready to submit your offer, we'll ensure it’s well-positioned and fully aligned with your financial and strategic goals. Once you’ve signed the LOI, we’ll use your weekly pulse meetings to ensure you’re fully supported in the next phase of due diligence and beyond. Whether it’s questions during negotiations or unexpected issues during due diligence, we’ll be by your side to make sure you’re making the best decisions for your acquisition.

# Do Financial Modeling {#do-financial-modeling}

Use our [**financial modeling template**](https://acquimatch.notion.site/Financial-Modeling-Template-160c367030c98059af96de0e0a13184f?source=copy_link) to understand what your offer should be. This step helps calculate the deal's feasibility by accounting for cash flow, DSCR, and **seller financing**.

* **Seller Financing**: We **strongly recommend trying to include at least 5% seller financing** in your offer that can be applied towards equity injection which means it will be on full standby for 10 years (meaning no payments to seller). This financing is beneficial because it can help with your equity injection, provide a safeguard if the seller misrepresents anything, and allows the seller to earn interest rather than tying up funds in escrow if you structure it correctly with your legal team. If the seller is unwilling to provide financing for that long, you can do a standard seller note. 

* **Deal Costs**: Remember to include **5% of the purchase price** for deal-related costs, such as legal fees, Quality of Earnings (QofE) reports, and bank fees on top of the purchase price

* **AcquiMatch Fee**: Don’t forget that our fee is **separate from the 5% deal costs**. It must be referred to as **"consulting services"** (NOT a success fee) to have a chance to qualify as part of your deal expenses and equity injection for SBA purposes. If your lender doesn’t recognize it as equity injection, then it will be a working capital addition and you’ll need to ensure DSCR works with all additional fees.

* **DSCR:** We recommend never going below 1.5 DSCR despite what lenders will tell you, ideally higher as this will ensure you have funds to cover fluctuations and a no growth or decline situation. Please bear in mind that our financial model will automatically account for maintenance capex from any depreciation numbers, as well as pull taxes out based on the structure you chose. Our DSCR model is extremely conservative for this reason and will usually be much higher in the lenders eyes. 

* **Capex**: Capital expenditures are often not found on the P\&Ls. If you see a large depreciation number, that will be from an investment of equipment or assets, find out what it is and how often it’s needed. Our template uses AVG 4 years depreciation to model. Your QofE team will calculate this accurately during their process. 

* **Pro Tip**: Model based on both trailing 12 months and the last 3 years of financials, especially if more than 6 months have passed in the current year. Also, plan for a potential decline in the first year or two post-acquisition, as this is common during transitions. Model with no-change & a decline using the different scenarios in the calculator. 

* **Taxes:** Remember tax returns are not due until September 15 of each year. If you are looking at a business before that point, ask if they’ve filed taxes. If they haven’t, expect the books will change when they do, as accountants will often make changes to account for a favorable tax position. 

* **Asset vs. Stock Sale:** You will need to choose the type of transaction. Most of the time you’ll want an asset sale as you can get favorable tax situations and it eliminates much of the liability. However for some businesses a stock sale will be the right move, like when there’s contracts that cannot be reassigned. The seller will often push for a stock sale because they perceive it to be better for them from a tax standpoint. If you do end up choosing a stock sale, you should ensure you’re modeling for it and that your FCF looks relatively the same as an asset sale, which usually means pulling the purchase price down. During DD you can engage a tax professional which can help you understand both your and the sellers tax situation.

# Working Capital {#working-capital}

Working capital is essential for ensuring smooth day-to-day business operations after the acquisition. When you are building your offer, assume that net working capital will be included in your purchase price. 

A way to look at it is buying a car. You need a full tank of gas to get home. If you buy a car without any gas, you’ll have to pay additional money in order to get home. 

Working capital is what you will need to cover the gap between taking over the business and starting to get payments from new clients to cover your expenses. It is typically comprised of Accounts Receivable, Accounts Payable, Current Assets, Current Liabilities, and Inventory. 

The net working capital number is what a full tank of gas will cost. Anything over can be negotiated with the seller by leaving some of the AR with them, or buying excess inventory on consignment, for example. 

* **Watch**: Check out [**this buyer’s club**](https://www.notion.so/acquimatch/Chris-Barret-QofE-Report-Part-1-Midwest-CPA-177c367030c980dba14bf207c1d2e262?source=copy_link) with Chris Barrett from MidWest CPA explaining working capital and a QofE report (something you’ll need in due diligence).

* Your QofE team will calculate this accurately during their process during Due Diligence, and if it’s done correctly, both you and the seller will be a little disappointed. It shouldn’t be too rewarding for any one party. 


# Figure Out Your Offer {#figure-out-your-offer}

After completing your financial model, it’s time to structure your offer. Include the price, **seller financing**, and **working capital** terms, among other things. 

We have co-created an LOI template with Barlow Williams for you to use. It includes all of the key terms we like to see. We recommend watching all of the guidance videos before you start filling it out, ensure you read the footnotes. There are a lot of videos, but they will give you a ton of good context and information so you feel comfortable filling out and submitting your offer.

[**Get the template and Watch the Video Here**](https://www.notion.so/acquimatch/LOI-Template-From-Barlow-Williams-160c367030c980a1afd1caa1dc56e45e?source=copy_link) 

* **Action**: Send us the files to your modeling & LOI offer. We’ll help fine-tune the structure and ensure that it’s competitive and financeable. We cannot edit the language in an LOI or tell you exactly what to write because it’s a legal document and we are not legal advisors, but we can guide you through concepts and positioning. 

* **Action:** If it’s your first time submitting an LOI, after we’ve reviewed with you, we recommend getting a legal review. This helps you feel confident in the future to fill this out on your own. Barlow Williams offers this for about $500 and it can be credited towards your legal fees in the process (This offer/price is subject to change)

## LOI TIPs

* **Exclusivity Period Extension:** PLEASE ensure exclusivity will be automatically extended if the seller doesn’t provide requested diligence documents and/or say the diligence period will start after receiving seller docs and automatically extended. THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT.

* **Expiration Date**: Add a deadline to your offer to prevent the seller from shopping it around. Make sure you make them aware of the expiration date when you send.

* **Business Continuity**: Ensure that the seller is required to continue operating the business as usual during the sale process. This protects the business’s value as you move forward.

* **Due Diligence List Due Date:** Your diligence list can take a lot of work to compile, if they want a timeline, aim for at least 2 weeks for you to get this together with your deal team.

* **DO NOT USE THE BROKERS LOI OR PA (Purchase Agreement)\!\!\!** \- You always want to bring your own documents to this process.

Sometimes a broker may request an IOI (Indication of Interest). It’s important to assess the situation and discuss with us whether submitting an IOI is the right strategy. If the deal isn’t competitive and there are no other buyers, starting with an IOI can be a reasonable approach. However, in more competitive situations, brokers may use an IOI to shop the deal around to other buyers. In such cases, submitting a full LOI with a clear expiration date can help move things forward quickly, limiting the time other buyers have to react and pivot.

# IMPORTANT {#important}

The deal structure in your financial model should match what is in your LOI. NEVER submit an offer without running a financial analysis on it. Make sure the numbers in the top boxes on the model, i.e. cash at close, seller note, etc. match what numbers you put in the LOI.

# 

# Send and Start Negotiating\! (or sign\!) {#send-and-start-negotiating!-(or-sign!)}

Once your LOI is ready and reviewed, submit it to the seller. If the seller agrees, sign\! 

If negotiations are necessary. . . 

## Negotiating Your Offer Tips

When it comes to negotiating, we recommend using the **Ackerman Bargaining Method** from Chris Voss’s *Never Split the Difference* (**page 205**). This method allows you to start with a lower offer and incrementally increase it while anchoring your negotiation effectively. For a full refresher on negotiation check out **Chapter 9 ("Bargain Hard," page 188\)** of *Never Split the Difference*.

* If the broker asks for a “best and final” offer, adjust your approach accordingly. We can help you refine your strategy for competitive situations.

* In-person is always best for negotiation, zoom 2nd best \- avoid doing hard negotiations over email as much as possible. 

* When using the Ackerman method in person, if you’re worried about remembering the different numbers, save them on your phone, then you can pull it out and pretend to do calculations which gives them even more weight. \- remember the final offer should be VERY specific and exact number.

## Bring your lawyer into LOI negotiations.

If the seller and broker make significant changes to the LOI you submitted, we recommend working with Barlow Williams, or your chosen M\&A attorney, to review the changes.  

We will of course work with you on the conceptual changes, negotiation, and whether you should agree to things, but the actual final version of the contract should be reviewed by a lawyer before signing (if there were material changes to the template)

# When should I speak to lenders? *After* you are under LOI. {#when-should-i-speak-to-lenders?-after-you-are-under-loi.}

We **do not** recommend engaging lenders **before LOI**. Lenders will request items you typically **won’t have access to until you’re under LOI** (full financials, customer concentration detail, aging reports, lease/contracts, diligence data room access, etc.). Pre-LOI lender outreach also risks **signaling prematurely**, potentially **hurting your buying power** and complicating your equity injection strategy.

**What to do instead (Pre-LOI):**

* Work with our team on deal **structure and viability**. Our proposed structures are **SBA-compliant** in the vast majority of cases.

* Focus on **getting the deal under LOI**; we’ll move fast post-LOI.

* Prepare your **personal financial package** (PFS, resume/bio, liquidity proof) so you’re ready once LOI is executed, **do not** send this to lenders yet. In some circumstances, we may recommend putting this in front of a lender, if that’s the case, **we’ll let you know** and advise on **who best to speak to**.

**Post-LOI: We make the introductions.**  
Once you have a countersigned LOI, **our team will introduce you to lenders** aligned to the deal’s profile and your goals. You’re always free to use any lender you choose, but using lenders we know tends to **speed underwriting** and **protect terms**.

**Note:** In rare cases, we may advise limited pre-LOI lender contact (e.g., highly unusual structures). If that applies, **we will tell you explicitly**.

## Lender FAQ

**Q: I want to “sanity check” my deal with a banker before LOI.**  
**A:** We get it, however, that tends to **waste time** and can **hurt negotiating leverage**. Work structure with us first; once under LOI, we’ll move swiftly with lenders.

**Q: Will waiting slow me down?**  
**A:** No. We pre-stage what lenders need and introduce you **immediately post-LOI** to 2-3 best-fit lenders so you’re not starting from zero.

**Q: Can I choose my own lender?**  
**A:** Yes. You can use anyone you like. Our intros simply **optimize speed and terms** based on our experience with specific lenders and deal types, while also protecting your equity injection and any fees you’ve paid to us.

# Getting close to a signed LOI?
