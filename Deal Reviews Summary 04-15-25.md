0:01 - Luke Gillespie
  Hey.

0:02 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Hello.

0:04 - Luke Gillespie
  Can you hear me all right?

0:05 - David R
  Yeah.

0:07 - Luke Gillespie
  Great.

0:08 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Are you okay?

0:09 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah, you're good.

0:11 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Awesome. All right.

0:14 - Luke Gillespie
  Are you at the new place? I am.

0:22 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, in yesterday.

0:24 - Luke Gillespie
  Oh, cool. Good for you. Yeah, I take it. I take it. You're not finished moving in yet because there's no decorations in the background.  I just have a hot water internet until like two hours ago. Yeah.

0:43 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Supposedly a costier service that was hooking everything up for us and they neglected to tell us we needed guests for like hot water.  So for Jayden, like took a shower last night and he's like, it's really cold. was like, is there not like?  Hot water? Oh, God. Oh, nice. Okay. See Brian in here, but I don't see him.

1:12 - Luke Gillespie
  It's still connecting. looks like. Good news. Justin submitted an L.O.I. and that's awesome. didn't know that.

1:22 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  What's that?

1:24 - Luke Gillespie
  I said I didn't know Justin submitted an L.O.I. That's great. know, think he rejected that business. I initially. And then Ryan pushed back on him on a call.  And now he submitted his first L.O.I.

1:35 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  with us. Yeah, that's, uh, he did. I think he did mention that on. I knew that, but thank you for reminding me.  But, you know, the reason why we got to push back on him, right? Like, especially when we know the costs of everything.

1:52 - Luke Gillespie
  But today in the Slack channel, Jesse and Lindsey rejected a write up I gave to them. And I was about to send the rejection email to the broker.  And then we had it typed out. about to hit send. then I thought of the meeting on Friday, how much of write up costs.  And I was like, no, no, no. I'm going to wait for Ryan to talk to them.

2:06 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah. Does that look like Ryan's coming through? I think. Can you chase him?

2:17 - Anke Badenhorst
  Sure.

2:23 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  He's in here, but it doesn't look like he's adding himself to the room, maybe. I was in the waiting room.  There he is. Hey, welcome back.

2:44 - AcquiMatch Team
  Thank you. Sorry, of course. So I go. I'm dealing with some issues with the internet. I left. I ended up buying new electronics.  I got, I got new headphones. So I don't have to use these anymore. I got a new computer. But then that disconnected me from, I guess, the internet on the co-working and it couldn't get me back online.  So anyway, that's why someone was coming and talking to me. They're trying to get my computer working, my internet working.  So I should be good now. Yeah, good to be back.

3:20 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Welcome back. So lots of other ways to hang out right now, which is awesome.

3:27 - AcquiMatch Team
  Yeah, I saw that.

3:28 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Three in the last week, I think. No, because Chris admitted one also.

3:35 - AcquiMatch Team
  Okay, yeah, so we didn't even touch on that because we really just talked about that off market the whole time.  So I saw that, but he didn't tell me anything about it.

3:45 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, I think he was kind of like whatever about it. So it was just like, you know, due to dating, but.  So it even too early and Chris submitted an alloy. last week and then um Justin submitted one last night.  I was like, Andrew got his out too.

4:08 - AcquiMatch Team
  Andrew got his out last night.

4:12 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  I'm asking you.

4:14 - AcquiMatch Team
  I said, Andrew got his out last night.

4:16 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Oh, okay. Sorry. It sounded like a question. was like, did it eat them? Um, so was it, was it finalized with feedback or what happened with that one?

4:25 - AcquiMatch Team
  Yeah, it finalized. Um, me and him just went over it together. I didn't make any, hardly any adjustments at all.  Um, um, you know, look good. And it's just Andrew being Andrew's like, I don't know. you think? Is this good?  I was like, that's fine. Great. Submit it. So we submitted it. Seller responded and said, thank you. I'm gonna take some time to look over at my wife and I'll get back to you guys.

4:51 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Well, this is initial feedback. He said he was revising based on the seller's feedback.

5:00 - AcquiMatch Team
  No, no, I think he just wanted to make. I mean, it was pretty much just he structured out the seller note, how he kind of waterfall that down in terms of it was going to be 40% seller financing.  20% over this time frame, 20% based off this. So it was just that.

5:26 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Got it. Okay, cool. And then just learning for everybody on the on the LOI side. So as much of a pain of the  as it is, like we typically put the amounts, not the percentages into an LOI document because it's locking in a price, right?  like how those numbers are actually determined, which is different than the modeling that we do. So that is typically like how that LOI is structured.

6:01 - AcquiMatch Team
  So, yeah, I mean, what is it about that? So the purchase price is stated, let's say it's $4 million, right, so he says I'm offering the purchase price of $4 million, 50% dollar note, 50% paid at time it close.  So what is it about putting the dollar amount there as well?

6:31 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So it's a legal document, so in a legal document, we need to be very specific about the amount of cash, right, and like where the dollars are going to different places so that there's no like misinterpretation or miscalculation.  So that's why we put the purchase price number is X and then of that, this amount of cash will be paid under these conditions at this interest rate.  So, you know, I'm having a loan document like it needs to have the numbers in there. And so, because it's a legal document, we want to make sure that folks are putting it in.  So, there's no room for interpretation down the line because it's not going to vary. Right.

7:15 - AcquiMatch Team
  It's like, we're locking this number in. This is what the agreement is and then we'll retreat on the line.  Yeah. Okay. I still see it that way. mean, even from a legal stamp stamp, what I see it hard for someone to look at it and say something different, if the price was 4 million, says 50%.  Right. Because the seller didn't have the dollar amount. So that's where for me, it looked confusing. I'm like, you're saying this amount of clothes, but then the seller, no portion, you're just listing a percentage.

7:47 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So it's like, Oh, it should have had an answer. Yeah. So, like, if you reference a template, like every single part of that has an amount in it.

7:59 - AcquiMatch Team
  Okay.

8:06 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So, I'm trying to think of an example, but like, let's say their calculation ends up being different than what ours is.  So it's like, so there's no misinterpretation of like what that 15% actually looks like in terms of cash and how it's allocated.  But he also had a legal review too. So you just want to also think about like where we are in the review process and did the lawyers review this before I did.  If they did, then we should be giving minimal to no changes in the document unless we understand like why the lawyers, but it backed that way.  So we just want to make sure that we're not conflicting with the, you know, folks at no contract law.  So to my understanding, he'd already had the, like, the words were on the calls and had reviewed the documents before sent it over.

9:08 - AcquiMatch Team
  Is that correct? Yeah, remember if it was before he sent it over, if it was before the conversation. On that, the call with the seller, right?  So like, before he yeah, he presented it, it may have actually been before that. But yes, he did me well.

9:33 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Well, I know he's, he's got on a lawyer's involved sentence. So if you're feeding back yesterday, then the lawyers have already been involved.  So also good for you to make sure like, you're in the loop, like, Hey, what are the lawyers feedback, you know, so that we understand like, when when we're at this stage, we're now helping them project manage all the people, and we need to kind of understand who's giving one advice so that we're not conflicting with any advice there.  I especially. Okay, great. Okay. I did not check the Slack channel. I did not have internet. So Luke, did we have an agenda for today that we started on?

11:15 - Luke Gillespie
  I only wrote down one thing. David wrote down one thing he wanted to talk about. So let's start with Brian, whatever you guys want I think I just started one last week, didn't I?  Yes, in the Slack channel. But I do believe we covered all that last week.

11:28 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Did we? Okay. Can someone remind you what I put on the agenda just to make sure it wasn't something I wanted Ryan to also hear?

11:36 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah, I'm pulling it up right now. I had checked it this morning. I'm pretty sure we covered it. Going back to the Slack channel right now.  Okay. Right up numbers we talked about. Oh, you probably wanted to talk about this with Ryan, check your incorporating real estate and videos and new calculator and model tool for me to use then for the 504 loan.  Yeah, so that and then okay voice notes from clients and for tax returns broker slash dealbacks fashion and then just some JJJ update before your calls you had with them that next day and then Gio and Jason dealbox edits plus updates and with topics in school.

12:23 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  got a new thread in the channel last week and I said agenda for today's call and there was a point I put in there.

12:30 - Anke Badenhorst
  It's an RE calculator for write-ups need a better system.

12:35 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Great, okay.

12:36 - Luke Gillespie
  Sorry.

12:37 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  And then what were your agenda points?

12:41 - Luke Gillespie
  Oh, I just was going to ask you I didn't really have anything to talk about. One thing that I was going to ask you if you had any feedback or advice or to give them a room for improvement for that advice.  I was given to Gil at the end of last week because we were really good to talk about that after you know.

12:55 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, great.

12:58 - David R
  I just wanted to let you know about it. that we are running these off-market campaigns, that's it.

13:04 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Great. And then anyone else have agenda points, and I'll dig into each of these. Cool. Awesome. I will touch on voice notes.  So Ryan, something that I started using with the clients that I want us to encourage them to use more, because I think there might be a lack of them wanting to give feedback, because it's a pain in the butt to like type.  But if they record in Slack, or they do a screen shared Slack, like it automatically transcribes it. So sometimes it's easier for them to just push out a voice button in Slack and leave a voice note.  So Justin started doing that last week. I was doing it for clients too. But it's something that I think we should use these tools to just give quick feedback and also saves you having to jump on calls with them all the time.  If you can just like do a quick voice note to them about having an encourage them to use the voice note function.  and or screen share when they're like, I'm having problems with this document or this financial template or whatever like, Hey, you know, here's here's a quick like reminder, like click the video icon, click your screen, you can turn off the camera to show me what's going on.  And then because Slack automatically transcribes it, then it's it's very easy for us to just read it. That sometimes it's easier for people to communicate using voice or video.  So I want to encourage them to do that so we can get more feedback from them and also try to avoid having to get a meeting done for everything in or them not giving feedback because they just don't want to type things.  So trying to talk about that on the calls, but since you're on the front lines with them to encourage them to do that too.

14:45 - AcquiMatch Team
  Okay.

14:47 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  And then you can do it back to them also. So like, you know, if you are in between meetings and just have like a quick like sometimes I feel like messages are better delivered using voice.  Um, so I was feeding back with some of the clients on voice when they were getting a little like concerned about things or felt like just needed some inflection versus just text.

15:12 - AcquiMatch Team
  Okay. Cool.

15:19 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Great. Okay. So, something that I picked up on. In one of Luke's write-ups was that we don't we're using this simple deal calculator right now and it's not really giving him an awesome thing to be able to do real estate calculations in deals.  So I think we need it better calculator so that if there is real estate that Luke can make sure that he's.  Evaluating that not just using the quick deal calculator, because he's kind of having to come up with his own thing.  So a way for us to standardize our showing clients real estate. So, Luke, did I properly pick up on that being a potential issue for you and getting write-ups out?

16:07 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah, I get what you're saying. mean, you saw what I did and those write-ups just pull up some quick 504-loan estimator and you're on nerd wall item and that's easy for me, obviously, but it's not the most attractive and professional to be presenting to our clients, so I get what you're saying.  I'm happy to try to help see how we can improve the deal calculator. I tried to give it a look the other day, see how we can incorporate a 504-loan.  Yeah, I'm happy to help on that project. like modeling, so I'd like to get involved on that. Because there's also another thing, Athena, that I've seen in some SBA pre-qualifications with these deals that include real estate, is that it's not just a strict 7A and 504, whether there's a 51% real estate or food or not.  Sometimes when the real estate price is less than 51% of the total purchase price, they do a blended loan term in a 7A loan.  So you don't get the full 25-year Air Mort, but I've seen 13 years, 17 years.

17:02 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  that's something to think about as well. So it's hard to do with the write-up stage of that. It's a little bit easier to do with our crazy like insane model.  I feel like you need something that's just standardized for, because the clients need repetition to start wrapping their header on numbers.  So just because we have familiarity with that sort of thing, if we're like showing them deal calculators and stuff, they might not get it.  So having something, you know, the important thing at the write-up stage is like, what does the cash flow to them look like?  And then make sure that we're not calculating debt service coverage. So with mortgage payments, we're also not accounting for rent and that sort of thing.  So I just feel like we're not, we're potentially scaring them off real estate by not having a solid like just standard calculator that we're using that they  start warning what that looks like.

18:03 - Luke Gillespie
  I understand. Yeah, I'm brainstorming or something that I could do to maybe solve this would be to take that quick deal calculator we have.  And I just have two of them. One's the 7A loan, one is the 504 loan. And then I combine it into one spreadsheet with the cash flow and everything.  And that is what we will present to the clients. Does that make sense?

18:26 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, we need to put in the rent payment though. So like you'd need to be checking the panels for the rent payment because if you're doing the calculations without like adding the rent back in, then they're not getting a true picture there.

18:41 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah, and I did do that on those last deals with the normal calculator with guilt.

18:46 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Right, so but we need a standard calculator that shows that because they need to more like if we're just giving them all of that and not showing our work, then they're not that we're kind of denying the  opportunity to learn and the real estate concept is like pretty big and scary for a lot of them.

19:06 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah.

19:11 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So whether it's you that builds it or whether we source it and you say what features that you need I don't really mind but what I was seeing is that we don't have a clean and way of like showcasing real estate deals right now on the write-ups.

19:31 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah, I agree. I get what you say.

19:37 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  What how do you feel like because we have a really great I mean Mitch is building out this model and I think we could get him to do a simple thing if we told him we need it or you know what don't want us to put it on you if you're like I don't have like that kind of firepower to build like a model out and whatever but I know what features that I need because and that's how I built this one I was like I know  what it should look like and what features that we need. know what things that we need, but like in terms of like building out the formulas and stuff behind it, I don't really, I don't know, you know, advanced non-formulas to do that.  So how do you feel about that? What would your preference be there?

20:20 - Luke Gillespie
  Because I'm ambitious. I want to try to give it a crack, give a crack at it myself and see what I can do.  No problem. I'll try my best.

20:29 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay, so my other question is, what is that going to cost us in terms of write-up output from you to get you distracted on that, building out a financial modeling project?

20:38 - Luke Gillespie
  Exactly, exactly. hopefully not as much as the external consulting would cost. I'm thinking, give me three to four hours of time to think about this and I can come up with three to four hours is probably all I would need.  And if you think about it in a write-up opportunity with us three to four hours, you can say it's three to four write-ups.

21:00 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay, that's too many at this point.

21:03 - Luke Gillespie
  All right. All right.

21:04 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So we're just getting to the point where we're like possibly looking at breaking the minimum, which is the most important thing that we need to do right now, right?

21:15 - Luke Gillespie
  quality deal to close to clients as much as possible.

21:18 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  And when we say good quality, like, you know, matching to the single ones that they're walking into and that sort of thing.  Because we're at risk with quite a few clients. So this is a nice step. And although you're capable, it's like then making sure that we're making the right fall in terms of what's priority as a business.  So that being said, do you think three to four write-ups is a good use of your time to do something that we have somebody else to do?

21:48 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah, I understand if it's not too expensive for the external consumption, then yeah, you're right, business priorities.

21:54 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, when I say costs, I don't necessarily mean financial. So I know what the costs would be to have an external person.  to do it. I'm okay with that. But the cost to us as a business isn't isn't just financial, it's like right-ups, right?  And does anyone remember the cost? Does anyone want to fill Ryan in on on the little math that we did as a team last week?

22:16 - Anke Badenhorst
  No.

22:18 - Luke Gillespie
  There's 400.

22:20 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Is that a wrong part? should we see what he thinks it is?

22:23 - Anke Badenhorst
  Yeah, yeah. Let's see what he thinks it is.

22:27 - AcquiMatch Team
  What's that?

22:29 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  We did a calculation of the cost of every single write-up, right? So if we take the total expenses of the business and the total write-ups that we've done in the history of the business, what do you think each write-up costs us?  Or has cost us to date?

22:59 - Luke Gillespie
  $1,000.

23:02 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So it's actually more like 3,000, which is why I, one of the many reasons why we need more write-ups, right, because that's where it pulls the cost for write-up down, and if people are like, I don't like it, it's like, well, that's a $3,000 product that we just created.  So why are we let them walk away that easy from it, and why are we creating a $3,000 product that people don't want?  So here's another fun one for you. How much do you think every signed LOI has cost us if we take all the signed LOI's in the history of our business and all of the expenses?

23:47 - AcquiMatch Team
  15,000.

23:49 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, it's about 50 or 60.

23:52 - Luke Gillespie
  I can't if you all remember. You were 60.

23:54 - David R
  60.

23:55 - Anke Badenhorst
  Yeah.

23:56 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  60.

24:05 - AcquiMatch Team
  Yeah, I mean, can you hear me?

24:09 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah.

24:10 - AcquiMatch Team
  I thought everybody froze. It's so bad. Yeah, I mean, I guess you could look at it that way. But really, I mean.  It's, um. It's kind of just about like the processes, the bandwidth and all that kind of stuff, right? I think right now we're.  We're closer to getting people under lot than we were in the past, right? So we can literally do the exact same process.  I think that we've been doing for the next six months and get way more L.O.I. just because how much more everyone is now familiar with their role and how much we're actually getting done.  There's like a startup cost that's almost kind of where I feel like those things are.

25:17 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, profitability question right and having enough cash flow as a business. So while it's not the indication of like there's the optimization that we have as we get better at what we do and but at the same time if we continue at that in that way well it's not going to be a sustainable business so that's why like just looking at our success metrics the write-ups signed up otherwise those are the things that get people closer to buying a business.  So it was an interesting metric for us all to consider in one you know it's like we're creating a $3,000 product, or is it, is it one that they like, if not, why, what happened to it after we hit it over to them, like how it gets us all to look at it and treat it much differently rather than them just being like, man, compliance, no, like, okay, you know, well, hang on a minute, like, let's talk through this and like Justin nearly turned on this deal that we pushed back on him and now he just made a $9.5 million offer on it, right?  He got really excited about it. So, um, anyways, to bring that cost per write-up down, we need to optimize what we have here too.  So making smarter decisions about where we spend our time, right? the flukes are sold by the, like, on-market write-ups right now.  That's where the bulk write-ups are coming while we focus on bringing up the off-market. Although he's perfectly capable, I'm sure of doing a calculator.  It's- not necessarily the best use of his time knowing that we're trying to drive that right up cost down and overall success metric up of getting more signed yellow wise.  So getting doing more of what he's been good at to me is, know, like it's not a cost of your capability, Luke, it's whether it's the best use of your time right now with what our focus is.

27:21 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah, you're right. I agree.

27:30 - AcquiMatch Team
  Because the other thing is like what drives that number, I mean that number is driven way up also by like people like, hey, it's just we could not get her there, you know, like if she would have signed a couple of lines or even just want that drives that number way down.

27:47 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, I mean, it's it's like real expenses of the business divided by the cost. So we've been able to have a couple clients on our books that we haven't had to do that much work for that is covered our expenses as a company.  Yeah, yeah, but if she would have signed an ally and bought a business week on two, we would have made more profit off the bus.  Yeah, but we wouldn't have been able to operate without the money that she paid.

28:16 - Luke Gillespie
  So I'm talking really expensive to the business, right?

28:19 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  And you guys weren't doing active searches for her. So we got money for her search, but weren't it. were you can't hear you.  What did you just say?

28:39 - Anke Badenhorst
  I was just agreeing with you. just said, yeah.

28:42 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay, I saw you talking, I didn't think you were on the end.

28:46 - AcquiMatch Team
  Thanks up my bandwidth. I got the I do an hour, to call there, I did multiple calls, trying to show the modeling to her, try to get her to  pretty much, you can submit another ally on the moving business. I've set up a walk through for her to do at the vital circle store.  And because she's a little slower, it took me multiple calls and pushing together there until I arrived to the conclusion that it's not going to happen.  Right. So, let's just say she could have, she was slightly more capable, or let's say her health was in better position.  I think we should get about that bicycle store or that moving business. You know? Yeah. I just, I'm just saying is that as we optimize, even if we use the utilize the exact same process we have now, let's say we can just convert our clients slightly better in the future.  Right. Those, I think those numbers could drastically change. Just in terms of just like let's say if we modeled out, right, we started modeling out this is how much an LOI call.  stuff. It'd be hard to model that at the current price. It'd be like, well, so I get your point, like, how do we have a sustainable business if that's it?  But if there's these other things that we can think, all right, well, what goes into that price? What goes into that LOI cost?  One thing I think we've talked about, like I've talked about this with you, Luke, like with AA, I was like, yeah, it's kind of a bummer.  I can't, I can't get our forward on these. And Luke was like, well, at least she's paying the $5,000 a month and we're like, she's bringing revenue.  And I was like, yeah, that's a good point. But the thing is, is that if you look at the success fee, it's just like, it's so much better.  We can get them to buy a business as fast as possible. Take that money, get a success story. She goes, tells one other person, they come join us, you know, you get a JG.  Look at JG. That's a referral. out. Look at, he's almost, he's almost ready to purchase every business that we've given, right?  So if we get better referrals and better people, that'll come from more success stories. So it kind of just comes.  For me, I keep thinking about it comes on like a client-for-client basis. we can have them, if we invest our time and they give us that success, they get success and they give us that success, it's compounds, right?  bet we can drive that LOI number from $60,000 down more than half in a short amount of time if we start getting people to close.

31:21 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Well, in order to get them to close, we need to be better at delivering one products in the first place.  So I think if we're honest with ourselves, have we done everything we possibly can to get them like every perfect deal for them?

31:38 - AcquiMatch Team
  Oh, yeah, no. Yeah, it was a lot of room for the fruits, that's for sure.

31:43 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, which is why, you know, the numbers, knowing where those deals go, we're not, we like have been getting somebody deals out the door.  that actually like, well, what's happening to them after the fact and is the whole team discussing like why or why not somebody passed or we lost it and then looking at like how we can get better as a result of that or what made them sink their teeth into those things.  So, you know, the deal numbers, you guys doing those every day and Ryan, you too. So there's numbers against your name that we, you know, it's probably the most important ones of the L.O.I.s or what happens after.  So that on these calls, when we see like, oh, somebody lost a business. Okay, what happened there? And then it gives us an opportunity to dive in.  Is there any kind of a process that we could improve on that would make that not happen again on the future?  Or they sent their teeth into that one. Okay, what about that one that they like in particular so that we're sharing that knowledge across the whole team so that even, you know, at David's point, he's like, well, know.  Justin really loved this business because he saw more of a white-collar enterprise-type sales that this roofer company had figured out and not completely within a skill set.  what he ended up liking about it. It's those sorts of things that we're just going to have to continuously tweak.  It's not just volume, it's good quality of volume and what makes good quality of volume and that's just analyzing every opportunity at the moment, $3,000 an L.O.I.  as Luke pointed out, he's like, well, discussion, he's like, we're giving him two a month and they're paying $5,000 a month, would need to be less than $2,500 a month.  And so it's like, we can't keep operating this way if every new client that we bring in covers the costs for one month, you know?  So it's like, we need to get them out by that success fee too, that's how our role works. asked.  And we do that by learning what success looks like for all of them.

34:05 - Luke Gillespie
  Yep.

34:08 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Um, oh, so, um, anything in the reporting in the last couple of days that's of note, or you guys want to highlight?

34:42 - David R
  Yeah, I think it's we have a lot of studies now, a lot of campaigns running. So we have the MailCheck, which is the normal campaign, but we also have the HubSpot campaign, which are new sequences that we set up for all leads that we had in HubSpot before.  they were not taking care of these deals, I would say. we are activating again these deals into these sequences and trying to reach to these people again.  So this is picking up as well. Then also, we set up the expand the LinkedIn outreach. It just started yesterday, so we hope to have some numbers at the end of this week.  But I'm confident this is going to bring us something interesting.

35:36 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So I know we were A.B. testing, sorry, if you were just mention that. We were A.B. testing whether it was a male shake HubSpot thing, do we have any clarity on what's going on there?

35:47 - David R
  Yeah, we did a test with JJ's campaign, so we had one in Hubs for another one in Mailchick. It doesn't have a big difference between those campaigns.  The open rate is very similar, like 10% operate. And so I wouldn't say it's a big difference. I would say the big difference is the new sequences that we set up, which is reaching, again, the people that we were trying to get the re-engagement here, that we were trying to contact before.  So this is, yeah.

36:21 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Awesome.

36:22 - Anke Badenhorst
  then we pulled back the volume on NoShake as well, and that immediately gave us more responses. So pulling back the volume, it's looking like, you know, less stuff is being flagged for spam.  pulling down the volume worked on getting more NoShake responses. And so like David said, the HOP spot is running the re-engagement sequences on all of the old deals that were in cold.  So it was mentioning this morning in the cold, over 100 deals pulled back into re-engagement sequences. That's going out from Pekithina and from Ryan's name.  depending on who was the last contact with these people, and then so the numbers are picking up because they're already getting responses from these re-engagement sequences as well.

37:11 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Let me say less volume. Is that less volume per client or overall?

37:18 - Anke Badenhorst
  It's just what I'm saying, Lace, volume is it was set up to run 100 emails per client per day, and then we just turn that down to 50 emails per client per day.
  ACTION ITEM: Update daily team numbers sheet with on-market LOIs submitted
 - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/276621464?timestamp=2249.9999

37:31 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay, so we're not going to have a scaling problem when we add more clients.

37:35 - Anke Badenhorst
  It's literally amount of emails that we're sending.

37:38 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Great. So in the deal numbers, I'm not seeing updates from you, Ryan. Are you able to get your numbers in?

37:56 - AcquiMatch Team
  What? Are you guys looking at?

37:59 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  The daily time. Team numbers.

38:04 - AcquiMatch Team
  All right, check the same chat.

38:23 - Luke Gillespie
  Well, you're you have rows 16 through 18 for the on market. Yeah, it's. You see your initial on the far left, the R.  Yeah, I can fill that out.

38:39 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Well, are you guys are using this sheet every day, right?

38:44 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah.

38:45 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay. Yeah. So if you're using this every day, if everybody can get your numbers updated every day, because the bank is sending it to me.  Is that possible, Ryan?

38:56 - AcquiMatch Team
  That's possible.

38:57 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay. Awesome.

38:59 - AcquiMatch Team
  first time we've done that. over this on the call so I was not prepared.

39:01 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  That's what we'd be discussing. Okay, but I was under the impression that y'all were using this and that you knew it was being reported back to me too.

39:12 - AcquiMatch Team
  Yeah, my plan on this was to sit like map out some time to sit down and just go over everything of the things, look at everything, some serious time for me to look at it as soon as I get a chance.

39:30 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay, great. Yeah, well, I mean, start with the dailies and then you can go back, but you know, if everybody's expected to do daily numbers, I think we need to keep it updated because it's a way for us to kind of track what's happening and see where those bottlenecks are happening.  So and then August gets this to me every day on my dashboard so I can track things on my end.

39:58 - AcquiMatch Team
  Sure. Yeah, I mean those are minor. just like off market stuff. they're only really filled in if I do an off market.  Oh, and then the on market is just pretty much LOI submitted. So there are, there have been some submitted that I need to update, but it's, I can do it in a few seconds.  That's all great.

40:17 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  And these are really important because I want to be able to discuss these, right? So like if guys are keeping communication on this after LOI also, or if there's a like lost after LOI on this, there's something to think about, but like these are the things that I want to dig into on our deal calls too.  So like what happened, why were they accepted, etc. So actually Ryan, I'd argue your numbers are probably the most important for us to A, know who's submitting LOI and B for us to dig into like, well, what got them excited about that deal?  Um, why did it get accepted and then we can start doing that knowledge share with the team on these calls also.  Sound good.

41:18 - AcquiMatch Team
  It's good.

41:20 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Sweet. Okay. Um, David, do you want to do anything else on the reporting stuff for?

41:28 - David R
  No, I don't. I don't think I don't have anything else.

41:31 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay. Great. So David, do you want to do your expanding update really quick or was it just the expanding is running?  Yeah, basically.

41:41 - David R
  I mean, it's running all the clients there with different campaigns. So we are just expecting expecting some connections and some answers for people.

41:49 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay. Amazing.

41:51 - Anke Badenhorst
  So, Athena, we started it off extremely low. So David did the research on keeping everything inside of the LinkedIn.  limits as to not have your account flagged for spam or blocked for any reason. it's starting offline, it's doing account warmups, but all of the client campaigns are currently running on it.  We actually already have two responses on it. So David's now also looking into a connection to expanding G Slack so that Luke can get a ping as soon as a response comes through.  So yeah, very excited about it.

42:27 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Awesome. Have y'all updated Ryan on that or Brian, you're aware of what they're doing?

42:33 - AcquiMatch Team
  Oh, what's all that?

42:36 - Anke Badenhorst
  It's the expanding that we talked about this morning in the Cool Ryan as well as the stuff that was in your handover document.  The off-market owner leaped in outreaches that we started doing with the software called expanding. So David and me was setting it up that last week and we hit go on it on Monday.

42:56 - AcquiMatch Team
  You hit what on it? Go?

42:59 - Anke Badenhorst
  Yeah, it's live.

43:00 - AcquiMatch Team
  Yeah, we started it.

43:01 - Anke Badenhorst
  it's running. It's a, it's a beast, that, that software. David is digging out over it. I'm completely digging out over it.  So, and then so that's going to keep running and then the responses from the owners, that's Luke's baby. He put up his hands to handle those responses.  So we're really excited about it. And we're really hopeful that we're getting us some good quality responses, so Luke can quickly get them on a call.  know, we can, it's good. We're hoping that this system and this process will get a quicker turnaround than cold emails is getting us.  So, I'm optimistic, I hope.

43:42 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Nice work guys. That's great. And it'll be, it's like, if we just attack it from like every channel, you then especially multi-channel too, if they're getting emails in, they see us on LinkedIn and I'm really excited to see how that goes.  So, thanks for coming on.

43:58 - Anke Badenhorst
  about with LinkedIn. and is with email seeing Ida and Luke really working hard on getting the off-market owners to accept we're not spam right so they're sending LinkedIn profiles like we are a real person this is a real company right here's my LinkedIn profile and with the LinkedIn outreach is that's kind of like an automatic like they can go in they can see you're a real person that you've got an amazing LinkedIn you know profile up so I'm hoping to alleviate some back and forth that that you know Luke and David has to do with these off-market owners with with the with the off-market out leading out creatures yeah right thought there and this is something that I mean it's just again untested theory my my theory is that the older retiring owners don't have a profile so something for y'all then hey like just keep that back in mind so that we can and I don't know if there's a way to have data around that so we can actually come on

45:00 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  to fire but you know just what's the like how many of these folks are actually like retiring that are actually on LinkedIn or maybe just making assumptions that they don't have LinkedIn profiles but I know when I was doing my own search it was really struggling to find them.

45:19 - Anke Badenhorst
  Yeah.

45:21 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah Luke physical mail or we should be signing our loan documents tomorrow or we are signing in tomorrow and then then I can green light doing some of this stuff but I'm excited to try all some other things but we need to use the tools we have first because just throwing money at other channels doesn't really tell us much either for not measuring and making the most of what we have already.  Oh so I know we wanted to talk about feedback from last week Ryan were there any deals that you wanted to talk through in particular?

46:01 - AcquiMatch Team
  No, maybe just the thing about Chris about when we should schedule that and what we should discuss. He just told me on the call that he was like, Athena thinks I should make the offer the day after.  I was like, okay, cool. I was like, why are gonna time that? And so that I think the question is, where do we sneak in a time for me and him to talk between where he meets the sellers and then he gets with them the next day to give them the offer.  So I didn't, I haven't seen Slack if we've actually started that conversation with him. It doesn't look like it.  So yeah, just that we just need to talk with him about that and make sure he's covering everything in that offer.  There's a lot to talk about.

46:53 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, so because he's there, so my intention for you having a meeting is with him, was that you talk about with that.  potential offer could be before, but we need to make sure that he's like, so something that came up late last week was, and I don't know if he's been doing this the whole time, but Chris was wanting to make an offer on the roofing company, and I was like, screen share, you're modeling with me so I can understand any screen share that's a model that I've never seen before, and he was just making on numbers for what he thought Capx was, and what he thought working capital was, owner salary, and I was like, whoa, I can't advise you on an offer, like can you drop the financials into our template?  When he dropped the financials in, he didn't put the things in the right place, like where appreciation was, adbacks were owner salary, that sort of thing, so I had to like redo it for him, so I was like, okay, I'm a little bit concerned that Chris has been making offers from the place of like using this.  like very simplified calculator that he's using, which puts him in a disadvantage on these like especially larger deals, right?  Like how is he actually looking at forecasting and modeling and that sort of thing? So point number one with Chris is I'm concerned that the financial modeling is not where it needs to be with him.  If he's using, I don't know if he made up the simple calculator himself or what, but it's especially the things, you know, where there's like essentially maintenance, catbacks or even just forecasting different scenarios, using different types of notes, et cetera.  Like he's putting himself at a disadvantage for putting together offers from like a simplified calculator. So I got him to put in the financials and then I was like, he's not putting it in the right place.  And then I'm like, well, how confident is he reading financial statements? is that like, do you work more closely with him?  So what's your read there in terms of how how he, how competent he is in the financial modeling, forecasting, reading financial statements.

49:08 - AcquiMatch Team
  Yeah, I worked on the modeling too much because a lot of everything that he's done to this point has been a lot of IOI or these kind of, you know, little short IOI stuff.  But when we go over financials is talking about adbacks and stuff like that, he seems pretty competent, nothing that I'm like, Okay.

49:33 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  how does he determine those IOIs? Like if he's using that calculator and like, there's not enough in there to like, especially at the deal sites that he's doing.  So that's, that was one concern. put that in my hand over to you. Other thing was, he has the opportunity to be in person with these folks.  He's flying in for Barcelona and making an offer in person is far more collaborative, right? And it's more of a, hey, know, like enjoyed meeting you guys yesterday.  What do you want out of this, et cetera? But you don't want to water the initial meeting walk through down.  But since he's flying out, you lose the opportunity to have that conversation in person. So if he puts the financials in before like he goes, so at least like that's there.  Then depending on how the walkthrough goes, if he's really excited about it, then it could be like, hey, and recorded the client video so you can watch that discussion with Chris to see like how we talked about it, to get up to speed.  But it's like, you know, a firm like paper in hand, but to go back the next day and be like, here's what I'm thinking.  How does that feel for you all? And then you can continue the conversations over email or zoom if you need to.  But when you're in front of somebody. having a collaborative discussion is far better than doing it over Zoom or over email.  So since he's already going to be there, if he can like pre-put in numbers, plug in numbers and get an idea of where he'd be at from an offer standpoint.

51:18 - AcquiMatch Team
  Yeah, yeah, he has some things also that, you know, are going to make or break this deal, which is essentially, he needs to model out how much he's going to be able to pay them in their first couple of years, because there's five family numbers, they're paying themselves a salary that's not sustainable.  So something he needs to talk over with them, which we've discussed is just like, hey, this is my offer, and then for you guys staying on with the business, I would pay you guys this, right?  they're making like 200 and let's call it $50,000 essentially, but they were like, Ryan, you can replace all these  All right, we added back some of those positions. Okay, if you're placing these, these guys are being overpaid because of family.  So one of the things that's going to make this business capital is modeling in a lower price point than what they're currently paying themselves.  So that's where the modeling. That's probably one of the key parts of the modeling. He's going to need to plug in so that we have a conversation with them.  He knows what he can afford.

52:27 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay, you're going to win tomorrow morning right before the walkthrough.

52:32 - AcquiMatch Team
  Yep.

52:35 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Well, have we asked him to start on the financials yet?

52:39 - AcquiMatch Team
  Yeah, I told them to model that out. And I did tell them to use the newer calculator because he did show me that older one.  like, Oh, I have the other one, but I like these in this one. I said, all right, that's fine.  But like you're going to use this. The one that we have so you can model these things out. So.  I'll go over that with him tomorrow.

53:00 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, well, maybe just make sure he's putting the numbers in the right place too because he was like skipping depreciation and like, that's where we can try to get an estimate of the CapEx from that.  And he like skipped that one and then the owner's salary is like, you know, where those go and that sort of thing.  So it just concerns me if he's putting offers together and he's not actually being like, you know, just making an estimate on what you think CapEx on a good way to be putting together the offers.  we ended up, we got him doing the spreadsheet last time. So at least he knows how to do it on like he did it on Friday on that deal.  But for something like this, that's this complicated and like this much real estate in that many salaries, like he can't be using a simple calculator.  I mean, he can use a simple calculator, but I wouldn't feel comfortable advising him to make a whatever 10, 15, 20 million dollar offer.  We're using a simple calculator. So if you don't think he's going to be ready for the offer in person, and you think there's another way to play it, totally fine.  But I just, in person, is such a better way to start the conversation, in my opinion. So it doesn't need to be a form of offer.  But like, hey, so love meeting you guys yesterday. I've started looking at numbers. And this is why I'm landing.  How does that feel to you? Because then they're having a discussion versus sending something over, then mulling it over, and then back and forth, and whatever.  And Zoom is kind of like a less ideal place to do that conversation too, although you can, if you need to.

54:45 - AcquiMatch Team
  Sure. So ideal scenarios, he meets with them the day after he gives them a verbal offer, since he's already built that connection, so they can mull over it, so I can send you guys an official all the way in the next couple of days.  We just need to make sure that. what he's saying, he's very competent before he sits down.

55:04 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, it's a sort of like, this is, this is what I'm thinking. How do you guys feel about it?  And he can talk to him about how he arrived at that, you know, and that sort of thing. So at least you can get like in person feedback from them on what may or may not work for them on that.  And then he can go away and work on it, but it seems like they would from what you're telling me about these guys that would probably go down better to have that conversation in person versus on Zoom or phone.  What do you think?

55:37 - AcquiMatch Team
  I think so.

55:39 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, and I know it's like it's pain in the  for people. But as much as we can, and I'm saying this for the benefit of everybody on the team.  Right. The more we can get clients to do in person, the better we're setting them up for success through this process because you just interact with people.  when you're like breaking bread and you know like in person and it just it's like hey here's where I'm at what do you think and it's like you can go back and forth and write things down and do calculations and stuff and it just doesn't feel as like zoom still makes it I think people still have their defenses up on zoom because you can't read full body language you can't get a read you know so the more we can get clients to do in person for these things I think the better result that they'll get definitely doing if they if we can't get in person next best is like doing offers over video where they can like have an interaction with each other and stuff like worst is sending an email with the offer redlining and doing that back and forth and my god we saw like your few of you weren't here when even you I did this but like the cat reverting to email.  all to discuss points that really should have been done in person. And I imagine that deal would have, you know, been closed how they done that.

57:13 - AcquiMatch Team
  Yeah.

57:13 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Does that answer your, or does that help you, know?

57:21 - AcquiMatch Team
  Yeah.

57:23 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Cool. So, um, also, have we heard from Dave Collinson?

57:32 - Anke Badenhorst
  Any updates on that? Hey, Jason again.

57:38 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  It's so weird. It's been like weeks.

57:41 - Anke Badenhorst
  I'm just going to say that it's chasing on a new thread. Maybe it's getting lost in between. I'm just going to start a new thread that will get his attention.

57:49 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Did something happen? Like it can still be on holiday.

57:55 - Anke Badenhorst
  Dad can still be on his honeymoon. Maybe it's just overloaded. I'll win back. So, let me just,

58:05 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  And what was the last conversation they all had? Do you go on a call with them, Ray, or we haven't even done that yet?

58:11 - Anke Badenhorst
  We haven't even done that yet because when we tried to do that, he didn't just want to chase him.  Then he was like, I'm on my honeymoon in Southeast Asia. And I'm like, OK, do you have any indication of when you'll be back so we can schedule something, didn't get back to us, chased him again.  I just wanted to know if you're still in your honeymoon.

58:32 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Nothing. Well, before we chase him, I never got feedback from David and Ryan if there was exciting deals on there.  Like, is it worth chasing him at this point?

58:45 - AcquiMatch Team
  Yeah, it looked like there was a lot on there. We found, you know, it's not, we can only know so much from what he presented.  But, yeah, it seems like we could stuff we can work with, at least definitely to narrow down five business.

59:00 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  for sure. Okay. And would it help any of our clients or any of ones that we're struggling with?

59:08 - AcquiMatch Team
  So the unfortunate part is that he doesn't have, he doesn't work in some of the states that we need like Oklahoma and what was it, Ohio or J.J.  So that wasn't fortunate, but he did have a lot in some states that we have multiple clients like Georgia and Florida.  So we're like, we're focusing on Georgia Florida leads. And he has them sectioned out by state, which doesn't help us.  So we want to talk to him about city and narrowing down the search and making sure that if we're hacking to see five deals that their direct hits before we get started, but it's going to be, it's going to need to be a phone conversation after what we looked at right now.  I was like, no, I want to get on the phone. And then now that he hasn't been getting us on the phone, I'm like, all right, well, I'm glad that we're pushing to get him on the phone because I with this kind of response time, I need to.  speak to them before I feel confident I was paying the money to the Sealeats.

1:00:05 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Mm-hmm. Um, but it sounds like our off-market is picking up just a little bit by the sounds of it.

1:00:14 - AcquiMatch Team
  A little bit. been chasing one guy, a defense company in Oklahoma. Seems like it could be a fit for A.H.  He wants to meet me in person, second Oklahoma person that wants to meet me in person. Um, so I kind of just kept chasing him with the help of Eda.  He responded to me He's like, hey, I'm busy this week, Ryan. So he's still responding. I've been cold calling him as well.  Um, he's got another one that would return one of our messages, which is the junkyard. The junkyard business that came through one of the Facebook leads.  So he's been communicating with us. Could be potential there. called him as well. Didn't get through. Um, but yeah, there's some of them, um, I did.  an off market called the day. Unfortunately, the whole business is pretty much in Pakistan, it was an IT business for for Gil, but it's pretty much like a Pakistan business, so it's just not going to work.  But I got another one tomorrow. So there's movement.
  ACTION ITEM: Reschedule call w/ JJ's off-market opp (300k rev in 2024, prev 1M/yr).  Emphasize performance notes potential
 - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/276621464?timestamp=3675.9999

1:01:18 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Great. And what happened for JJ? I heard there was an opportunity there.

1:01:26 - AcquiMatch Team
  So the one for JJ, what happened is AA and the off market scheduled their final call. You're like, hey, what's the degree one o'clock tomorrow?  Right? So that was during the off market call that I had scheduled for JJ. So I just messaged them and say, hey, I'm sorry, I have to, you know, I'm to have to move this car.  you available tomorrow? have something to come up with. Can you do tomorrow? Did I get a response from them?  Although, I sent them an email asking if they could. once their availability, I'll make something work for them. I'm for having to reschedule.  But it's honestly, it looks like a low priority deal. mean, they did only 300 something thousand dollars in revenue in 2024.  And Luke said the guys had surgery or something like that, or an health issue. He had a great, he had a traumatic brain injury the last year or something.

1:02:24 - Luke Gillespie
  And that's why their revenue dropped to $350K in 2024. But he says before 2024, it was more like a million dollars a year.  So we try to keep as open mind as possible markets. So that's why I still push the, you know, it doesn't sound too great.

1:02:38 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Well, performance notes are unlocked with something like that. So, okay, I think it's still worth chasing because she was asking where off-market opportunities for her.

1:02:53 - AcquiMatch Team
  Okay, I can reach back out to him.

  Yeah, that'd be great. Well, I know I'm keeping y'all over. But also, Luke wanted to chat about last week supporting clients, who's our MVP, massive help to just get the responses and take care of the clients and kind of step into Ryan's shoes bit too.  So, um, specifically, Luke was helping a lot with talk tracks. That was a huge, like, time saver for me.  Um, so it was very helpful, not only to give them talk tracks, but just remind them where they were in the process.  Um, and then Luke, did you want feedback on, like, what happened with Gil, just at the end? did you have a read of where you think that happened?  What would be helpful to you in terms of feedback there?

1:03:51 - Luke Gillespie
  No, I was just asking, maybe you don't have any feedback to give. just wanted to ask because you always have some room for improvement for me.  Mostly at the end of the week, right with you when I I was giving him that feedback. thought maybe if you had any advice or a whimpering improvement on that, if not totally fine, it's, I'd love to hear.  read a great job when there's no critiques.

1:04:09 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, I think you did a great job and just giving them information and really what they're looking for, I think, is confidence.  But sometimes when you're servicing clients, and this is, this is a subtlety that you learn with time, but something to pay attention to is sometimes giving them all that information can be too much information.  And even though the information that you gave him was cracked, it kind of overloaded him a little bit. He's like, what am I supposed to I follow the process, right?  So it's like, I don't think necessarily that you gave him the wrong information. But sometimes what we need to do is we need to bread from stuff and where they're out in the process, right?  So almost chunking it. down to like what what is the next move for him and what's the next outcome that we need and how can we help them think of so you saw today like he's like okay the next thing I need is to get a coffee right and so when you work with different clients you'll start learning like what do they need in this moment and some people want all the information they want to know like finish line work backwards so I can get an idea where I'm at in the process some are like I need the next breadcrumb in the process otherwise I'm going to get overwhelmed with everything that I need to do um so what we learned about Gill was he's using this notebook google notebook what was it notebook learning of the model so Ryan I think I think I added this to handover but so Gill is taking all of the deal files and he's feeding them into this notebook language model which then gives them a podcast which is pretty cool like um date  and shared it about acne match. I was like, oh my God, they have been like picked up on the differences between unrestricted ventures and agriculture.  Like unrestricted ventures was me, the search or buying businesses with acne match was like, I was like, that's cool.  And they were like, time now, this is really interesting. I'm like, this is so  up that like AI is just making a podcast up.  But anyways, so Gil's using it, I think maybe to outsource some of the analysis. And so it was pulling questions.  I was like, I don't even know what this means, know, I was like, I don't even know what it's pointing out or what it's asking, not the best analyst in the world.  But you know, it's like, Hey, if you're going to be asking questions and you kind of want to understand the question.  So with Gil, he's wanting to make sure that he covers all those bases and that he doesn't miss anything.  So with him, it was like, well, what? Okay, you're at a place now where you're not getting through. the seller call on with one and on the other, you are going to get a seller call and you know, you have an opportunity to ask them some questions.  like, the next time I put it back on them, and you heard me say that as like a wrap up today, like what's the least amount of information that you need to feel confident moving forward at this stage and then help them kind of reduce things down a little bit in their mind because it's like Gil will come up with like a million questions and they all do it and it's like all of your questions are valid but the questions that you ask at the particular moment in time are important.  So reminding them of like the process is great but also like hey, you know what you might have done that like chunk it down little bit it's like here's the process I know you're aware of this because also Gil gets like he wants to make sure that he knows or that we know that he's doing everything and he's a good student like that's why he's motivated right?  skill likes to follow a process of being a student. So it's like, hey, Gil, I know you're following the process.  We're at first date. So what are these questions that you have? Do you think is first date question? you can almost play it back to them and have them do the work rather than the feeding of answers.  And again, this is like subtleties of a couple of decades on my end of client servicing and learning the little hacks to get them to do some of the work for you, but also get them learning and engaging in a different way.  So Gil's now feeding, like I'm glad we uncovered that. He's feeding all of them. like, where are all these questions coming from?  He's like, feeding it into a language model. It's like, which model says all these things are wrong? it's like, okay, well, of these is important to you?  great, done your homework. You've got a lot of great questions. date stage, like, what do you need to ask for a second date?

1:09:02 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah, good point.

1:09:04 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  And it's something for all of us to think about, right? Like, this is just a great, thing to think about as we're helping people learn or go through the process and something that you, I could be better at.  I try to be good at is like, when you all come up with problems, rather than me feeding you the answers, like, what do you think is the answer?  You know, you probably know already, or, you know, like, or you tell me what think the answer is, and it gives me an opportunity to see, like, okay, there, like, let me fill in this knowledge gap for you.  Yeah, like, you're exactly right, like, more of that. So we can do that with clients, too, without being patronizing and still being, like, good servicing.  So it's a delicate dance of putting the work back on them versus doing the work versus them having a learning opportunity versus they just need a little motivation and push where they're at.  So, if you can kind of like, as you're reviewing their responses or their questions, I always kind of think of like, where's their mindset at?  Where are they at? What's their like proficiency in this stuff, you know, to kind of get an idea of like, might they be?  And also, how are they personally motivated? So, Gil doesn't like to look like he isn't on top of things.  And I totally identify with that because it used to be this like, and I still kind of react that way.  I like get caught out and I don't feel like, I feel like I should know the answer and I don't.  I hope you don't mind me sharing, like, I don't like to like, like, have, what was it exactly? like, you want to like be ahead of things in the future now?

1:10:50 - Anke Badenhorst
  Oh, fair buoyant. See, that's what you called it. I'm going to be like, I should have known that you wanted me to do that when you're going to ask me in two days, like, should have known.

1:11:01 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So if can pick up on our client's little quirks, what's the things that like also can just trigger an emotional response from them that has nothing to do with like us thinking.  So Gil doesn't want to look like he doesn't know what's going on because it's like he should know even though he's learning this for the first time.  So sometimes that's a reasonable expectation that we said on ourselves. So if you could be like, good job Gil, like you're doing awesome and like, you know, and he loves that.  He loves when you like recognize the work that he's doing and he's doing a good job. it's like, you might want to consider this or hey, I know you're going to know the answer here.  These are all very valid questions and important ones. You're you know, first state stage. What do you think of these questions as important for the first date and then help, you know, try that as a response.  Other clients mean different things at different times. So that's kind of the fun as we get to learn each of them.  What scares them? What do you mean? Awesome, nice work. We will see you next time.
