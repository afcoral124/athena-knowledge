  Good morning. Good morning.

0:03 - R Cash
  How's it going? Phenomenal. Amazing.

0:09 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  We're waiting for Bonka and Karis. One second. All right. Let me get the note takers out of here. Hey, Luke, Anita.  How are you? Hello.

0:27 - Ida Badenhorst
  Hey, Athena. I'm good. How are you today? Good, thanks.

0:32 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  I got my morning yoga in again, so I'm feeling good.

0:35 - R Cash
  Nice.

0:37 - Ida Badenhorst
  Are you flexible, Athena?

0:40 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah, I was a dancer growing up, so I should be flexible, but because I did dancing growing up, I'm hypermobile.

0:49 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So if I don't keep myself strong and do my stretching, then my whole body falls apart.

0:55 - Ida Badenhorst
  Oh, wow. Yeah.

0:58 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Hey, good morning, Anka and Karis. Hi, guys.

1:03 - Charis Siau
  Awesome.

1:04 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Nice to see everyone. So let me give you the agenda for today. I want to discuss onboarding one. Luke and Charis have observed one already.  Cash has one with me at 10. So I'm actually going to end this a little bit early. So we have a break.  Um, but we're going to talk through onboarding one. Um, then we're going to get into onboarding two, because that's going to start coming up this week.  I think on Friday, um, we are going to talk about the client meeting weekly format and then start diving into the kind of like high level view of a write-up and what it was conceived as, what all the pieces are meant to be.  And then you'll be getting, if you haven't already, have we shared the playbook yet, Anke?

1:56 - Anke Jordaan
  Or are we giving that to them after this? Thank

2:00 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, so then the playbook, which is a monster because the whole team like kind of added in every single piece.  So I know you've been meeting with the team individually, but we'll be kind of going through top level write-up.  And Luke, I know you've been doing these, but we didn't train directly on them. So I want you to pay attention just as if it's new because making sure that we're removing any loss in communication and you understand the intention behind everything too.  So how's that sound for our agenda? And we'll take a little break midway because I've got a long day of meetings ahead and I need to keep my energy high.  So I need little breaks. I'm sure you guys will too. So first I want to hear Charis and Luke, what were your observations of the first onboarding session?  What questions do you have?

3:01 - Luke Gillespie
  No question. It's pretty straightforward and clear to me. Like with the new names of onboarding sessions, buyer discovery and deal box discovery, that's really what it is.  The first call is very much just getting to know their client, kind of doing more of the psychoanalysis side of things rather than the financial and deal analysis.  So just getting to know them, their background, their reasons, their whys behind everything on what they're doing, right? Learning their skills and then kind of why they're choosing to pursue a business.  So it's just a big get to, a long get to know you session. It's pretty straightforward for me.

3:34 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Cool. How do you feel about running out on your own?

3:38 - Luke Gillespie
  Good. Confident. And why do you think we do all of that? Because that's part of what we do. We try to match our buyers to the right business.  And part of that is getting to know them as a person, not just deal box, not just numbers and industries, but understanding their background, their, their, you know, emotional makeup and trying.  right. Trying to match them to the right deal. So as I've been including in my reports recently, trying to do, flex the psychology muscle of matchmaking, not just the financial muscle.

4:10 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, because, and that's, well, that's what Austin sells. That's what the company sells to potential clients. That we take a lot of time and detail to get to know the buyers intimately to be able to match them to very intimate matches that other M&A firms wouldn't really have thought of.  Yeah. And why do you think that's important overall for them to do it that way?

4:34 - Luke Gillespie
  Well, one, we're setting them up for success with the right business, right? We're not just setting them up for whatever's the hot industry of the time, like landscaping or HVAC.  We're trying to find something that really fits them. Number two, it's what we're trying to offer as a company.  We're trying to give that very personalized white glove service. And so included in that is getting to know the client as personally as possible and to be able to match them to the right business.

4:58 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, I guess number three, it's also. So a fit for them because we want them to be happy in their new business that they own.  So if we match them to the right business, they're going to be the happiest and the most successful. And that's really what they're looking for in this acquisition journey.  Yeah. So you're spot on. guess I would say the reason we do the white glove concierge analysis is so that they can be successful, right?

5:23 - Luke Gillespie
  It's not, we conceived it that way.

5:26 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  That's part of what we sell. It's very much a matter of people are highly likely to be unsuccessful, right?  And tank a business if they're not suited to run it, if they're not passionate about it in some way.  Like you don't need to be passionate about an industry if you can get passionate about the work, right? So finding out what makes them tick and what makes them light up and also what doesn't helps you to make, it saves us a whole bunch of work, Thank  If you put deals in front of them without understanding that, but also like helps them kind of see themselves in the business.  You know, that story of me going after property management, like I never even considered that industry until that deal came in front of me.  And I was like, oh my God, like there's so many characteristics of this business that suit me. But I would have never like gone for like an apartment management, property management company, that sort of thing, you know.  But as soon as I saw myself in that business, I went crazy. And you've seen that with our clients.  When they start seeing themselves in their business, they'll move heaven and earth to make it happen as opposed to like, yeah, I guess I could kind of whatever, do this business.  Like the numbers are good, you know.

6:42 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah, exactly. Great point. Cool.

6:46 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Good. Okay, Charis, you had a unique situation. That was the most unique onboarding like client situation.

6:53 - Charis Siau
  So I'm curious to hear your take on that. Yeah, I think I agree. With what Luke said, and for Matt and Jenny, I think that that would be my only question, right, is because, like you said, it is almost doing like two individual searches.  Um, so how we kind of synthesize that information correctly going through this search, and I think it's really helpful because obviously they are also needing a lot of this processing for themselves, like in their answers, they're just kind of like figuring it out as we're asking these questions, um, on like how they're going to work together, like who sees who in which role.  Um, do you want to give the team just a quick background on the situation so they could follow along?  Yeah. Yeah, yeah. So Matt and Jenny are brother and sister, um, and they're going into this search, um, with the anticipation of maybe acquiring one business, maybe acquiring...  They don't exactly know if they're going to do one acquisition together or if it fits more Jenny or if it's more Matt.  So we're kind of working out those kinks during our buyer discovery call. So, yeah, I put some thoughts together on it and kind of how to set a perimeter and maybe going through like them and creating an individual buyer box rather than together so that we can put both of them together financially in the metrics.  But I think that they may be looking at more independent acquisition, but we need to contemplate both. You know, it could be a combination.  And so there's multiple things at play here. So here's here's the fun part.

9:02 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  This session is also for us to understand where we need to do some coaching to get alignment because we're not running two different searches for the price of one, right?  It's not, but they have not aligned, which is what in this session, you guys, we ended up spending most of our time in the goal setting, vision setting space, didn't even get to the rest because I picked up, I didn't even realize they were brother and sister.  So I feel like I need a better brief before I dive into these sessions on what the situation is between the two of them.  I thought they were husband and wife. So thank God Charis said something because I would have embarrassed myself pretty bad.  So, but they did their perfect day of exercise separate. They have separate lives, separate like kids, what, you know, all of that.  So I wanted to start to get through. Through the vision setting, goal setting to see just how far apart we are and we're actually going to need to like course correct with them to get them into alignment before we start the search.  So when we do couples, this is like one of the hardest things is like it's like they don't necessarily discuss and they're not necessarily on the same page.  So we need the business partners to also be on the same page and make sure that they're in agreement for how we're running the search, whether they decide to like put one or the other into the business, but they've paid us for one search.  We're going to do one search, right? So we have to kind of like guide them to, and I really just think it's, they haven't really sat down and asked these kinds of questions to each other.  So it'll be interesting when they do the business characteristics, what comes through, right? Because we asked them to do it together.  Um, and like, It was funny. We had a couple, one of our second client, and they filled it out separately.  And we were like, what are you guys doing? Like, we thought it was just like, you know, we thought it was common sense for them to, to do it together, but they filled it out separately, even though they were a couple searching together and they had like totally different things.  we're like, okay, we need you guys to all go through this again together and have a discussion about it together.  So I'm curious what's going to come out for Matt and Jenny from that. But in, in this situation, we're going to have to be like probably a little bit more involved at the start and, or in the calibration period to get them on the same page and re-emphasize that and manage their expectations.  Like, hey guys, we're not doing two different searches for you. We're doing one. So let's agree the parameters to start on and how that works.  And we can work with you on how to formulate that.

11:54 - Charis Siau
  If they do end up, you know, making two or more. I mean, would it not, let's say, you know, in the original deal search that we put together for them and the results, and Matt likes one, Jenny likes the other.  mean, wouldn't it just be a matter of them, because it's the fee per business, right?

12:20 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yes, but what's paid up front is for one search. Right? Like, it's a whole lot of work to put a search together.  So I'm not doing two searches for the price of one, because 70% of their payment is up front. So if they do happen to find another business while we're going through this search, that's why we say, like, you have to pay, like, per business for the fee.  But if they decide that they want to do two different searches, then we'll just charge them for, like, both.  Because it is going to be way too hard for you to try to remember two different people's parameters. Now, we do have a situation, Luke, you're hanging on to Dustin and Lindsey, aren't you?

13:07 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah. Yeah.

13:08 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So Dustin and Lindsey, they're a couple, and they have a situation where it's like, okay, well, if the business only delivers this much money, then Lindsey will be the only one to leave if it delivers this much money that Dustin and Lindsey will leave.  So we just need to work with them to get them into alignment. And this happens with, like, business partners who start a business together.  Like, they don't have the tough conversations. They don't get into alignment. So that's, like, part of the benefit that we can bring them is getting them aligned.  But it's like, you guys are doing this together. We need to make sure that we're clear on what that looks like with you guys, and we'll help you get some clarity so that when we're looking, it's not like, oh, Matt doesn't like it.  Or, you know, Jenny doesn't like it. Like, you know, but they didn't have that conversation that they both agreed of the characteristics or, like, what they're doing or what their purpose is.

13:59 - Charis Siau
  Okay, cool. But in Lindsay and Kevin's case, like we had the same search criteria for them and they just came across two businesses that they liked and they individually decided to buy them.  We weren't doing two different searches for them. Okay. Yeah. So that's the thing.

14:15 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  It's like if people decide to buy multiple businesses, we just didn't want to like shoot ourselves in the foot with not getting compensated for the fact that they're getting like multiple or get taken advantage of for people that are just like rolling with like multiple ones.

14:28 - R Cash
  So, yeah. they end up doing that? Did they roll the fees into both of those acquisitions separately? Lindsay and Kevin?

14:36 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah. No, they were, they got a  smoking deal. We didn't have any success fees at the time. Okay.

14:47 - R Cash
  Awesome. They just paid a monthly fee and one of our lowest monthly fees. No wonder they're so excited about it and raving about it on podcasts and everywhere they go.  They got it for close to free.

15:00 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Well, I mean, they knew that we were like early too and like had a lot of patience with us, you know, like I knew them and they knew it was like a new company and that sort of thing.  And like also because of them and because of their success and because of buying two businesses, like we've gotten a shitload of like clients and, you know, pedigree as a result of that.  So, you know, like we've we've earned way more off them buying two businesses than they got with their two businesses.

15:34 - R Cash
  Well, I don't know. It evens out, you know, I guess. But yeah, no, that's just a cool story for sure.  It's super cool.

15:41 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Right. And, you know, the whole thing of it, like Kevin getting laid off in the middle of it when the plan was for him to keep the job.  And, you know, it was her switching from thinking she wanted like something like media or she wasn't creative and then realizing otherwise.  So it was fun to go on that journey with them. And because of them, and because of the way we went through that, it helped us like develop a lot of what we do, but also the success fees.  When we originally started this as like a monthly subscription kind of thing, didn't know what the costs were going to be, didn't know what it was going to take to like actually run these.  And also, I didn't like the percentage-based success fee model. I didn't have an idea in my head of like, how can we make it?  So it's like not incentivizing us in a way, you know, to like drive for like bigger businesses or like if a client has a bigger buy box, like over-servicing them.  So then when we came up with this flat fee kind of like retainer-based structure, we implemented that. But also there was this cash flow crunch.  Anke will remember this very closely, but like when we had clients ending services, we had to continue to service them for like seven weeks.  At like. To seven, eight weeks. And we didn't have the capacity to take on new clients until they were done.  And we didn't get any fee at the end because we had them on a monthly thing. And we started the monthly, like, a couple weeks before their search actually started.  So, yeah, all fun learnings in a, like, brand new startup that does not have a model like you can follow for anyone else.  But we've since corrected all that. But, you know, and that's something we can talk about with Matt and Jenny, Charis.  Like, if we can't get them on the same page, we'll be like, hey, maybe you guys need to think about splitting out your searches or just having one of you lead.  It sounds like Jenny's kind of like the main one that wants to do it. And Matt's kind of like either way.  Yeah.

17:45 - Charis Siau
  Yeah. I think Matt's going to be a little bit more particular in when he, you know, leaves his full-time job.  Jenny looks a little bit more primed and ready. And the SDE might be a little bit easier based on her search.  Thank you. So I agree. And it sounds like she has some imposter syndrome, right?

18:04 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So she might have needed her brother to like give her the confidence to do it, which is kind of what Lindsay was doing.  You know, she's like, Kevin's like, my wife wants to do it. I'm just here to support her, you know?

18:15 - Charis Siau
  So it kind of sounds like Matt's like, yeah, either way.

18:17 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  But what I loved about him was like, he's like, I don't think it's fair if like Jenny dives into the business, does all this work, gets all the, you know, the, the, does all the work to like get the business to a point I could work in.  And then me just like come in and work in it. So they care for each other. They've got a good dynamic there.  I think we can get alignment, but the purpose of the session isn't just to get their desires. It's also to identify things like that, right?  Like where are we going to have to do some coaching and dive in and like get alignment or get some more clarity or warm someone up, you know?  Um, so in that instance where we didn't get through a lot of this stuff. Fathom, we may have to like, I haven't had that much, usually I can make it up in session two, depending on what happens with like the business character, because that exercise of going through the questionnaire together, usually will throw up a lot of conversations that they have together, and then they get in alignment from that, right?  The very act of filling out that questionnaire, so then we can kind of clean it up and put a bow on it, and then just say like, look, let's do the calibration phase this way, look at some deals, see how that feels, and then we can update it later, but we just need to make sure that the two of you are on the same page.

19:42 - Charis Siau
  Yep, yeah, makes sense.

19:44 - Ida Badenhorst
  And Jenny and Matt's questionnaire came in this morning.

19:47 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Oh, perfect. Yeah, they did it together.

19:50 - Ida Badenhorst
  Yay! It is in there for you. What's up?

20:02 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  What'd you say, Ida? Oh, no, I said it is in their notion.

20:06 - Ida Badenhorst
  If anyone wants to take a look at it, pin it there in the notion.

20:10 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay, perfect. And then Cash, how are you feeling about going into pushcars and prepping for that?

20:17 - R Cash
  Phenomenal. I love pushcars. I'm excited.

20:22 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Ida said she really liked him, too.

20:25 - Ida Badenhorst
  Yeah, he's so nice and kind, and he was late for like three minutes because his boss kept him up and he like apologized 10 times for it.

20:35 - R Cash
  So it's kind of funny on like Austin's sales call with Pushkar, like before I started working here, Austin goes, hey, Pushkar, I've actually got a, Pushkar actually grew up in India.  And Austin goes, yeah, I actually have a friend who recently went to a wedding in India. And that was me.  I was that friend. So like. Austin was using me as an anecdote on a sales call before I was even working here, which is funny.  So yeah, excited to talk to Pushkar.

21:12 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  That's great. Yeah, it'll be interesting to hear. It sounds like they both got jobs. They got laid off and now they've got jobs.

21:20 - R Cash
  Yeah, they've got jobs again. It was just like that moment in time when they did both get laid off and they had like a three-month-old baby.  It was like the catalyst moment that crystallized that that was the big click that defined like, okay, I'm going to go do this and like create my own stability rather than being on the hook with a W-2.  But yeah, he's working now. It's just like that moment was like the big moment. The tipping point.

21:52 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  I love when we have something like that because we can anchor back to that throughout the process. So guys, I would.  And challenge you all to like really get to know that each of your clients tipping points, you know, like the emotional driver behind why they're doing this.  So in those moments of like fear, we can be like, hey, remember like how  powerless you felt when both of you were laid off with an infant?  Like this is the thing that's going to help you like have ownership and autonomy over your finances and your direction in life.  Somebody can't make a decision overnight that puts your family at risk like that. It's your decision, you know? So those are really powerful to understand, especially when they get scared, which they will, to keep anchoring back to that.  Like you don't need to harp on it, but like in those moments, you know, that can be the thing that like springs them out of the fear, like freezing, you know, overanalyzing.  It's like, no, I don't want that. You know, a lot of our clients recently went on holiday. I don't know.  Or sorry, guys, I lived in London for like 10 years. So I say holiday instead of vacation. They went on vacation or took like a couple weeks off and then they went back to work and they're like, I hate it here.  And it's given them a renewed like, okay, let's go, you know? And so that's been useful. like, it's good to use those things because they can get, they're comfortable.  They earn a lot of money in their jobs. Like that is comfort. So we have to find those points of discomfort to like remind them why they're doing this and help them move forward, especially when they get scared.  So that's a big life moment where that happened to both of them at the same time when you thought you were like solid and secure with work and having a salary and you've got a three month old, like, holy .

23:50 - R Cash
  No, he's super great. And he's also like, he's been through the process a lot of trying to buy a business himself.

23:59 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So I think.

24:00 - R Cash
  It'll be a much easier client to work with in the sense that he hasn't sat around and thought about, do I want to do this?  Do I not want to do this? Do I need to spend months waiting for an NDA? No, he sat through eight broker calls and gone through diligence on two CEMs and loft a deal.  He came to this conclusion that our service is what he needs a lot more organically. So I think he's pretty primed and ready to go and knows a lot more about what he knows and what he doesn't know.  And is a lot more humble to what he doesn't know. I think probably a lot of first starting clients.  That's, yeah.

24:41 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  It's good. So it can go one of two ways when they have a lot of experience. You have to, either they're like, that sucked, I need help.  Or you have to unlearn some of the things that they've learned, right? They get like deal fatigue and they get blinders on and they're like, no, I've looked at businesses like that.  And we're like, but look at this one, you know? So sometimes you have to kind of push them. It's like, hey, trust me, like go for it anyway, kind of thing.  Gil, when he started, had listened to every single Acquiring Minds podcast that ever existed. And he was so worried of like making the wrong decision that like, you know, he was just like, well, I heard this was a da-da-da-da-da.  So we had to like kind of get him into the trust us, like move forward, you know? So you can have situations like that.  So it's always fun to see like what's going to come out. Peter, I thought would be way more willing to move forward.  And he's actually, I've not seen that kind of analysis paralysis or like freezing since Stephen Pauly actually, because he got burned so bad on his first acquisition.  He is like. He has PTSD around it. So I see him just like spinning around in circles about moving forward.  So that'll be a fun one to unlock for him, right? And just showing him it's okay to kind of walk the path and stuff like that.  So they all come in with different things that start showing up in the first couple months. And everyone has a blocker.  Everyone has something they do to block themselves from moving forward. So my favorite part is figuring out what it is and helping them unstick it.  Okay, cool. Any questions on part one, why we do things that way? Any of the questions, the structure? And then Charis, I was going to ask, since you've seen one now, although we didn't get through everything, how do you feel about leading the next one with me?  I'm serving. Jumping in if needed. With Matt and Jenny's? No, the next onboarding thing we have.

27:08 - Charis Siau
  onboarding one? Yeah.

27:09 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah.

27:10 - Charis Siau
  I'd be totally comfortable. I think I could probably run with it on my own if needed, unless you wanted to, you know, go back and forth together.  Either way, I think I could do it. Yeah. Yeah.

27:25 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So Lisa and Carmen are, I know them pretty like from the past and everything. So like they're expecting me to be on the call and we've like kind of canceled and rescheduled the call.  So I want to be there. Also with guys, like my intention is I run one, you watch, you run one, I watch.  And then that way I can jump in and like fill in any blanks that, you know, don't expect you guys to like have down pat to our call.  If you do it, great. But then that way, if there's info or things that I'm like spotting or like could be potential issues that can jump in, won't necessarily need to.  But yeah, let's have you run with Lisa and Carmen on Friday. So whatever you need to get up to speed on that.  Or the second part, I've actually removed the deal experience too. I don't know if you guys have looked at onboarding one recently.  So Anke, we need to update the playbooks. But the asking how many NDAs, et cetera, et cetera. There's so much to get through in that first call.  We're just not really getting to that. And actually when I was re-looking at the script for call two, which unless you've looked like late last night, I've updated it.  We're going to go through that today. And it fits really nicely into doing business characteristics, doing like deal volume, and then going specifically into all their deals so we can learn their thought process.  So I'm going to go through that format today since we're starting call twos on Friday. And Anke, need your help to get everything updated because it looks like we have just notes and stuff, but call one in particular needs to be updated.  Something also that I want you guys to like pay attention to is that I don't know what AI you're using to do the prep for this call, but it can often like remove a lot of the questions and the nuance.  So I don't know what the answer is, Anke, but I've just noticed there's like differences between the three that I looked at and there's questions that aren't necessarily there like nuance.  So I think we need to probably like mimic the thing that we're doing today with the script and have those answers there available, but like have the script there so that they can work off the script and refer to the answers rather than use that as the script.

29:56 - Anke Jordaan
  Yeah, I think it's a good idea.

30:00 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Also, the reason why we put those prep together that way was to help me get up to speed quickly if I wasn't on the sales calls or whoever was running the calls, but I want you all to watch all of the sales calls before you go into that first session with your clients.  So I think it's almost going to make this prep irrelevant in a way because you're going to have the background of like actually watching it and getting to know them and then being able to like run through that script of call one, getting to know them and being able to refer back to it like, hey, I remember with Austin that you said this, right?  Like, um, so we'll, we'll evolve it. It's, it's interesting now to be able to have you guys doing it because it used to be like, I did the sales calls and I did onboarding.  So I kind of had that background to be able to do it. When I stopped doing the sales calls, I needed some prep to get up to speed on them, but things like their brother and sister weren't coming through.  So I was like, well, that's an imperfect process. I'm not getting the brief I need before I go into that.
  SCREEN SHARING: Athena started screen sharing - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/371035470?timestamp=1873.655502  So always evolving. Okay, cool. So let me share my screen here. Okay, so started putting together a playbook of sorts for the Dealbox discovery call.  So this call is after they filled out the business characteristics form. And it's not just about checking boxes on this call.  The real purpose of this call is understanding their preferences, their beliefs, any biases that they have, so that you can anticipate and coach them around things that could become blockers later.  So you want to understand why they've made the choices that they have as we go through this, not just.  It's like, okay, you said you want this. Okay, cool. Right. It's like, tell me more about that. Why did you eliminate that industry?  What about this industry that you like? What you're trying to do is start to get into their heads so that you can be looking at deals as them.  Right. And anticipate where they're going to have like potential issues. So I don't want you all to just select deals as clients because they don't have the sophistication and like experience to be able to see whether something is a good deal or not.  But you need to know how they're going to look at it so that you can anticipate what they're potentially going to push back on or whether they're going to like it or what their preferences are, those sorts of things.  So there's outcomes for like the client and us, you know, really what we want the client to understand is that this is the starting point of their deal box.  It is their theory. Right. And we're going to start, we're going to start testing. Theory in those first couple of months.  And then talking through their selections and their biases, we're able to start giving a little bit of coaching in this call so that they're prepared for that down the line.  And it's not just, I'm putting deals on your desk and you can decide whether you like them or not.  It's, I'm putting deals on your desk. I want you to trust me. I want you to look at some things and we're going to calibrate together.  We also want them to trust that we're going to look at deals as them. It's a lot of, a lot of these people have been scanning listings for months, right?  That's, that's terrifying to, to give up the way of like the, you know, have somebody else in the driver's seat for some of them.  And it, for some of them, it's really hard to stop scanning the listings, right? So this builds trust that, okay, we understand their preferences, why they think the way they do.  And oftentimes get in. to think even deeper than they have about their deal box so that they're feeling good about what the next steps are and that we're going to support them.  For us, the things we should be leaving the call with are a detailed documented deal box that's ready to draft for client review, a real understanding of their experience level, decision-making style, and potential appliances, notes on where you think coaching opportunities are that need to be addressed during those first couple months, coaching either on biases or skill sets or knowledge sets that they have gaps on, and then really setting the foundation for a trust-based working relationship.  They need to trust us. You know, we're putting multi-million dollar deals in front of them that we've looked at for them, and if they trust us, they're more likely to move forward and give it a shot, and that's really what we need.  Because we did the calculations on the cost per write-up and it's pretty extortionate. When we think of the cost of the business, every single write-up takes multiple people.  takes weeks of time. It's a lot of money and time and effort and resource to put a write-up in front of someone.  So if they don't trust that we're looking at deals the way they would and they just reject a deal, all of that work is just like out the window.  Any questions on the outcomes before we dive into the how-to? Okay, so Anke, let's add the video from this to this playbook and then get the instructions outlined.  So the two main people involved in like... Part two is Ida or whoever our client coordinator is, because they're going to be scheduling the calls between the clients and the analysts, sending the client the prep.  They're going to attend the call and then support with the follow-up. So they're that glue, making sure that everything is moving forward.  Analysts you're preparing for and running the call and making notes. This is really important because we aren't really doing a good job of like documenting this sort of stuff and doing an internal profile on somebody.  So since you guys are going to be owning this from the start, like making notes on this client for everybody to understand, like, hey, they get nervous around this sort of thing or they would like more experience here, et cetera.
  ACTION ITEM: Update playbook w/ new onboarding process timings (72hr questionnaire return, 10 days total)
 - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/371035470?timestamp=2221.9999  So, yes. Okay, cool. And then. This needs to happen at least three weeks before their search start. The client needs to have at least one week with the business characteristics questionnaire and completed at least 72 hours before the call.  So I made a note here, Anke and Ida, if we want them to have a week and we need it three days before, they need 10 days, not a week, right?  So it's something to think about with timings in terms of scheduling. So making sure that the first one is scheduled in enough time that we can give them this, give them enough time.  Something I don't love is making clients like just have to do things very quickly because we didn't have, we weren't organized on our side.  It's not a good client experience. Anke and I were on the receiving end of that and we went to the acquisition.com workshop.  We knew it was scheduled for months and we're like, what do we need to do? What do we need to do?  And literally like a week before they're like, now do all this stuff. And we were like, what the ?

37:51 - R Cash
  This sucks. Like if we would have known, we could have scheduled this time in, you know, so. The Bancor Mosey one?  Yeah.

37:58 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah.

38:00 - R Cash
  Um, we're, we're in level two.

38:03 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Um, it's, it's really good, but there's just a lot of pre-work that needs to be done. Like getting your numbers together, setting your goals, like all this stuff.  And we were asking for a long time, like, what do we need to do? And then the team told us like, I think a week before.  So we, we were having to work outside of all the other stuff we had scheduled. But what was really cool is Neil, the portfolio manager.  I told like, we talked to him at the event and he's like, I was like, if you want to talk about it more, I'm happy to schedule a call.  So he scheduled a call, got all of our feedback. He's like, Hey, I'd love to touch base with you.  Like in the future, when we, when we implement this and get your thoughts on it. So they're really good at being open to and wanting feedback.

38:43 - R Cash
  Austin worked for a, or Mosey invested company after we, um, left new chip. So no kidding. After hearing stories about that company, you know, I think you can definitely, uh,  Have a good shot. That place was an absolute disaster. So I think if those guys, it was a team in Austin, this PR firm.  Anyway, like if those guys can get a Hormosey investment, I'm very confident that. Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

39:17 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  No plans for investment whatsoever.

39:19 - R Cash
  Oh, this isn't like his, this isn't actually like part of his deal analysis. Sorry. I mean, they do, they like, they, they talent spot during this, but it's like a paid for.  Oh, yeah.

39:33 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Consulting and business support from his portfolio team. But I have no plans on taking investment anytime in the future, if ever, because I see what that does to businesses.  So, but yeah, they do, they do these like workshops where they're like group workshops where you go. And then if you like that and you want to go deeper, then you schedule the van level two.  Thank you. Which is really expensive, but you get their portfolio team basically like analyzing your business. And then when you fly out there, they give you your particular like, okay, here's all the things that your team need to work on.  So it's bespoke to you.

40:14 - R Cash
  That's super cool. Yeah, it was awesome.

40:18 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  But anyways, the point here is, you guys will hear me harp on this a lot. Like, how can we get more organized behind the scenes so we're not making our clients like rush because we're not, we didn't have our stuff together.  You know, because when they get through this process, they're going to have to rush a lot. So let's not make them rush where they don't need to.  And then your prep for the call needs to be done at least 48 hours in advance so you feel prepared for it.  And then a checklist, what needs to be done every time, reviewing the client questionnaire responses, preparing the script, ensuring you've watched client sales calls.  You should have done this for call one. And then, but for... Whatever reason, if somebody, if we've split out one and two again, then I put it in here.  And they've had their buyer discovery call. So we've got the form, the script we're about to go through, and then just a quick access coaching guide.  And I'd really like to add to this. You know, I want this to be evolving. So as you see either me or you guys have moments where you have to coach them through an assumption or a bias, I want us to add it here so that we just have this reference guide of like, okay, they are stopping at this thing.  So I'll show you what that looks like in a second. But let's go through the script, and I'm going to give you the kind of context and the why, and I want you guys to read through it in particular.
  ACTION ITEM: Add map to dealbox discovery call script showing client's position in process
 - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/371035470?timestamp=2509.9999  It's actually not that long, so we can go through it. So onwarding to, or what are we calling it, deal box discovery.  Anke, can we add the map?

42:04 - Anke Jordaan
  Yeah, I'll add the map. So we still want to do that.

42:08 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Like, okay, here's where you are in the process, right? And we do that at, like, every point that we get on with them.  Here, wait, I just moved all your faces down. So I'm going to be looking down. That's weird. How do I move this up?  There we go. Okay. So just a quick, like, hey, here's where you're at in the process. You are here, right?  And I'm going to talk through, like, next steps later. You can pretty much read this verbatim, you know, as you guys are going through this.  So you're at the foundation stage. This is where we build your deal box. The deal box, this is the deal box discovery call.  Think of it as a starting point, the finish line. We'd rather start wide, refine over the first couple months as you start seeing and reacting to real businesses.  A deal box is just a theory until it's tested in the market. And those first few months are about calibration, putting deals in front of you, letting you test.  Assumptions, helping you gain confidence. So this is managing their expectations that they are not going to buy the first business that we put in front of them, right?  Like they have a lot of skills that they need to learn, like how to get through the broker, how to like build rapport with the owner, how to analyze businesses, how to validate their assumptions.  There's a skill building process in those first couple of months. It really only happens when they have live deals.  So we want to early and often manage their expectations on this, right? Like this is a theoretical process. The calibration phase is really important.  Something that I would say in sales calls a lot, something that you can use is like Lindsay and Kevin, you know, they underestimated the calibration phase.  were just ready to move, but they realized how important it was because they hadn't had a lot of reps of looking at real businesses.  So they said that was one of the most important parts of the process. So when people, if they push back.  We can say like, hey, you know, this is super important part. So telling them this call is about two things.  First, understanding your thought process so that when our team looks at businesses, we can look at them as if we were you.  And two, setting you up for success in the search by giving you enough volume early on to build reps, refine your criteria, and learn what really matters to you.  Um, here's that bathroom break thing, right? We may not need the entire time, but let's plan for a quick five-minute break on the hour in case you need it.  We're going to have to see with this new stuff whether we need an hour and a half or two hours.  Right now it's scheduled for an hour and a half. I have a feeling it might need to be two hours again.  So Anke, let's get feedback from the team after they go through a couple of these this week. Okay, so let's talk about our process and why we start wide.  I'm going back in the script. Before we jump in, I want to explain why we start wide and how the deal flow process actually works.  When our team looks for businesses for you, we're signing NDAs to access the confidential information. We're digging through financials and key details to make sure the business is legitimate.  We're filtering deals against your criteria so you're only seeing vetted opportunities. We're getting on broker calls and asking the hard questions to make sure the deal is worth your time.  All of that happens before you ever see a deal. If we only give our team one or two industries to search in, we choke the funnel before it even starts, and that limits both your deal flow and your ability to learn.  Early in your search, it's not about finding the perfect deal. It's about building experience. If we keep your criteria too narrow, you'll get fewer chances to practice talking with brokers, fewer reps reviewing financials, fewer opportunities to test your assumptions.  Starting wider gives us enough volume to work with you, work with so you can gain real world experience quickly.  Here's what we'll focus on today. We're going to identify any strong no's that would be deal breakers for you.  Everything else. We'll leave open for now, and then we'll tighten things up together during calibration based on what you learned from actual deals.  And here's how we're going to use what we do today. We're going to take your answers and turn them into your deal box and buyer profile.  You're going to review and sign these off so you're confident and reflects how you think. Then we'll kick off your search, and the first couple of months we'll focus on calibration, giving you enough deal volume to build experience, test assumptions, and refine your criteria.  The goal for this call isn't just to capture your answers, it's to understand how you think, so we can evaluate deals the way that you would.  That's how we get from good businesses to right businesses for you. Does that make sense before we dive in?  So all of that preamble is really important to cover. Why do you guys think that is?

46:49 - Luke Gillespie
  Setting the frame of the conversation so they know what they're going to get out of it, and that way you kind of set the frame and you can control the combo.

46:57 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, good, Luke. How are you guys feeling about what I just went over? What's included? Does that feel good?  Anything missing? Any questions why I've included it in that order?

47:12 - R Cash
  I think it comes off pretty clear. Cool.

47:16 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So it's written as a script, so you guys can basically just have that open and read it verbatim, you know, so you don't have to think through, like, what are the points I need to cover?  What should I say? Whatever. Or, you know, Cash, you'll know this from sales, but, like, Austin, when he came in, he followed our script verbatim, right, until he could, like, do it without having to read the script.  So that's one of the best ways to, like, learn something is just follow it exactly, exactly, and then as you go through it, okay, can I do it without the script?  I always leave it open because you guys will be doing one, maybe two of these a month, right? So it's better to just have it there.  But as you're going through it, if you're, like, Oh, it would be better if we told them this thing.  What this also does, like Luke said, setting the frame, but we want to cover off questions in their head before we go through this process so that they're not thinking of those questions as we go through it.  They're like, oh, okay, I understand why we're doing all this. So they hopefully are a little bit more open when we go through the questionnaire part of it.  But, okay, so then we want to, I don't know if it's going to be this long. I'm going to take the time out.  The questionnaire walkthrough is going through it section by section. You know, we're going to share the screen of the questionnaire that they filled out, cover each section in order.  And you're not just asking like, okay, you're good with this, da, da, da, da. It's like asking for the reasons behind the answer, confirming their selections, and making notes of any selections that need to be updated.  Ida's been on quite a few of me. And I don't think we've ever been on a call where they didn't update something as a result of the conversation, right?  So like they, first of all, this, this questionnaire is huge. So they tend to get fatigued. Sometimes they don't understand that it's like strong nose, right?  So Ida needs to be checking that. That's another reason why we need the questionnaire early on, because if it looks like maybe they didn't understand it, like what we had a client do recently, we need to correct that before we actually get the analysts on the call.  So Ida's going to be checking that when it comes through. And it's like, uh-oh, so-and-so only picked two industries.  I think we need to debrief them before we have the call, right? Because like then it's like you want them like sitting with it and really understanding the purpose, which is why it's so important to call one to harp on the fact, like I want your strong nose preferences, leave anything else open, make sure they really understand what the brief is for.  Or- Questionnaire 2, or the Business Characteristics Questionnaire. So anyways, we're going to be going through covering each section in order.  For narrow or limited answers, stretch the client with exploration prompts. So I haven't listed those out yet. What I'd really like is for when you guys are observing this to kind of like grab some of those, like, oh, Athena did this to dig deeper.  Let's grab those. And then we have a resource for everybody to be able to start using, like, if they're just limited in their answers or they don't know.  And then using teaching moments to explain how their criteria can impact their deal flow. So when we're going through this, I'm thinking about what's their preferences versus what are they?  Think is the right thing. And people can be very influenced by what they've heard on acquiring minds or, you know, even we send them, buy them, build and that sort of thing.  So what we want to untether or try to ascertain is like, what is learned versus desired? Does that make sense?  Yeah, cool. So I'm going to pull up the questionnaire and just talk through it. Have you, Cash and Charis, seen this yet?

51:39 - Charis Siau
  Yes. I've seen like the submitted form of it.

51:43 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay, okay. I've seen the raw one. So it's not, it's not brand new to you. Anke and Ida, let's, let's update the timings on everything to just make sure that it's all like in the onboarding process and what.  We communicate to the clients and everywhere that we're just communicating the same thing about 72 hours. Okay, we're going to be skipping the location preferences on this call, which means we might want to reorient where this is and put that as the last section.  Ida, looking at you for that. We're going to do a separate map call with them. So let me add that.  I'll add that to the script that we'll say, we'll go through the geographic, you know, conversation a little bit later.  We're going to start with industry preferences. So when I get to this section, I just say, okay, so really important that you're telling me what your no's are, what your strong no's are, because you've seen all the work that our team goes through to get a deal in.  I don't want them doing all that work if you're just going to automatically reject it. What we're trying to do is put things in front of you that we will get you on broker and owner calls, and you're not going to eliminate it until you've had a conversation with the owner.  So we can always remove things later, but leaving as much open in this early stage gives us the opportunity to give you more reps.  So we've tried to make it super clear here, but if they say they're not interested in anything in the category, be like, okay, talk me through that.  Like, why not agriculture? And what I think I left out on this is we're not judging or trying to change.  Just understanding and then giving them some, you know, information on like how those choices might impact deal flow, et cetera.  So when I go through this, I'm like, I'm just trying to understand your thought process. And even though you had the preamble, you might need to reiterate it.  Right. So like, tell me what you don't like about agriculture or trying to understand, like, why they don't like something.  Right. What about it did they not like? They're like, I can't see myself in it. It's like, OK, fair.  Or, yeah, I'm just like, I grew up on a ranch and I never want to do that again. You know, sometimes there'll be like an emotional tie to it.  Sometimes it'll be a preference, but you want to understand that. Then when you go through this with them, let's say they've selected a few out of a category.  OK, automotive and boat. So talk me through why we're open to car washes, but not. Not everything else. Or tell me why you're not open to car washes.  And they'll be like, oh, it's CapEx heavy. It's da-da-da-da-da. La-la-la-la-la. There's no money in it. So when they tell you why they don't want something, is it a personal preference or is it an assumption that they've made about that industry?  And as you go through this with them, you'll start to pick up on some themes and characteristics of businesses they like and they don't like.  And so that's when I might push back a little bit and be like, okay, well, you said that you're really interested in service-based businesses.  You like working with entry-level people. There's coaching opportunities. Blue collar people are who you're comfortable with. And you like putting things together.  So what about auto body repair is not interesting to you? And they're like, oh, I just don't think it's profitable.  I was like, well, if I should. I showed you a profitable business, you know, that had a really good system in place.  Like you figure out what's important to them, right? So you kind of want to like test assumptions once you understand like what their preferences are.  Sometimes they're just eliminating something because they think it's not a good business, right? And it's like, there's a good business in every category and there's bad businesses in every category.  So if we can put good businesses in front of them into a category, then that might change their selections.  And that's often where they end up changing their selections because they'll be like, well, you know, I've seen like our washes be very profitable.  I've seen most of them not be profitable, right? Like, and they might be like, oh yeah, car washes. I want those because they're, they're profitable and they're a good investment.  I'll be like, well, that's what the internet, you know, has touted. I haven't found any that like makes sense because most of them are like actual real estate investments, but we'll keep that open.  And if we find one. And, you know, and we did this for one of our clients. Like she, she came from Cody Sanchez's community, which is like, you know, laundromats and car washes are the gateway drug to business searching in that community.  And she kept like wanting a car wash. Luke finally put one in front of her. And I think it was like 20,000 a year profit or something.  Right, Luke? With the asking price, like the multiples on them are just insane. Usually men will skip this category altogether.  Understandably so. They don't have familiarity with it. Building and construction. The thing that you want to start teasing out here is how comfortable they are with licenses.  Right. So things like electrical contractors, things like HVAC. They'll say this later. So that's why I would review the whole question.  Before you go through it and see if they had a thoughtful conversation with themselves or us in the about licenses.  But with the new SOP change, it's going to be very hard for an unlicensed person to take over a business that requires an owner to be a license holder or requires multiple licenses in the business.  It doesn't mean we can't look at businesses and see, hopefully there's a couple employees in there that have licenses.  But if they're super gung-ho on, say, HVAC, then that's something. And they don't have a license, then we need to be like, okay, it's probably going to be the case where you need to identify somebody that can be a partial owner to come into that with you.  Because in a license situation where the owner retains the license, that means that they're going to have to personally guarantee the full loan for two years.  And most owners aren't going to be comfortable with that. This is SBA.

59:00 - R Cash
  So, Athena, something I just wanted to highlight here, and I sent this over a message when I look at this, but probably the biggest thing on the sheet that I think might help add clarity is, and this is just me growing up in the industrial space, but there's like a big mix here of like companies that are building.  And there's a lot of general contractor categories and contractor categories on that list. It might be valuable to separate those things to help get better information on what clients are actually interested in.  And I just know one of my best friend's dad is currently selling his general contractor practice, and there's just a huge difference between a company that's building, and they've got like 50 employees and a general contractor that's kind of got two people, but still doing like the same amount of.  with projects and revenue. And there's a lot that are really lumped in together in this category. Anyway, it might be helpful to have those two separate questions as to levels of interest.  Yeah.

1:00:16 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So like I said, with every category, there's going to be different examples, right? There's general contractor businesses that have built out the whole team and infrastructure and stuff.  But I take your point that like general contracting and like licensed trades could probably be separated out. So I'm down to look at how we can organize this better.  I guess for the purposes of the call, it's like teasing out their comfort level with licensed businesses. And like what that means for them going through financing, because HVAC is like the hot industry right now.  But if they are not a license holder themselves, then, and they don't have a license holder that can be  Be a part owner with them. Then you guys are going to have to look for businesses that have multiple license holders in the business that's not an owner because the owner would have to personally guarantee the loan.  Does that make sense? Yeah, no, I get that for sure. Cool. I haven't had a chance to review the suggestions you guys had on this spreadsheet, but Anke, are you actioning that, looking into that?  Yeah, I'm looking into that.

1:01:31 - Anke Jordaan
  Okay, what's your plans with that? Ida's done a lot of updates to the sheet and then Cash made some suggestions in the channel.  So I just haven't had a chance to like deep dive into it and then see what's the best way that we can get it updated.

1:01:50 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So it makes sense. Well, Cash, maybe go through, have you, did you make those suggestions before or after watching some of these calls?  Yes.

1:02:03 - R Cash
  Before, during, and after, I guess.

1:02:05 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  I guess it was like halfway through.

1:02:07 - R Cash
  Got it.

1:02:08 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay. Just want to make sure you had some context of like how the calls are run. So cool. Bear with us.  We'll like keep this as is for now and then update it as you guys go through these. Communication and media, for the most part, some of this is a dying industry, right?  With like newspapers, um, screen printing, printing, that sort of thing. So if they choose any of those, then I, that's something I'll, pull out.  All right. Like, um, that's pretty hard to work against the tailwind of a dying industry, unless they have something like super attractive.  So just making sure like we, we have those conversations, um, you know, clients will have different levels of familiar, familiarity with like.  Business theories, you know, dying industries, like a declining industry, a flat industry, growth industry. Like no matter how good the business is, if you're in an industry that's declining, unless you've created some incredible moat around it or some way to mitigate the tailwinds.  But sometimes what we'll see is people trying to sell businesses in a dying industry. So this is one of those sections where that can potentially come up.  Radio stations, obviously, like, you know, that's a tough industry now. Education in children. Like most people like kids, but they don't necessarily want to be responsible for them.  And there's things lumped in here. So I've seen people select this. Like I'm not interested in anything when actually they might be, right?  So something like a language school or, you know, test prep or dance studios, et cetera, where it's not like they're responsible for like children's daycare during the day and stuff like that, like may make them interested in it.  And then some are interested in it. Sometimes these also require licensing of some sort. And then some other things, Ida, did we get vocational trade education added to this?

1:04:40 - Ida Badenhorst
  Yes, I think we did. I'll just double check.

  OK, so we might then think about separating education and children because education of adults or vocational trades, I think, is like if somebody starts looking at that industry, they could absolutely.  Absolutely. Because there's so much money in the trades. Young people don't even understand that. You become a master plumber and you can like go around and find searchers that don't have licenses and become part owner and like a couple of these.  But like, so I'm just waiting for the day that we find a trade school that we can put in front of someone and like have them modernize it.  But yeah, so we might want to split out education and children so that it's clear what's like child care and child related versus a specialized career education, maybe vocational trade education is another one.  You know, like hair schools, stuff like that. Like it's an industry that's just waiting for someone to do a roll up and modernize it and make it cool.  Haven't seen it yet. Cool. Entertainment and recreation. Like a lot of times they might eliminate this because they think it's a, they don't think it's a good business.  But I, there's a like laser tag down the plate, down the road. Well, actually it used to be in Austin that was just like doing insane numbers, you know, rage rooms can be super profitable, you know, there's good things in every industry.  So if they eliminate something, understanding why they've eliminated it, and then just be like, well, actually, like, if the only reason you're eliminating it is because you think it's a bad business, but you would be interested in it.  If I found something that was profitable and hit your other numbers, could I put it in front of you?  And they'll be like, yeah, sure. So then you can uncheck some of these things as we go through. Um, there was a nightclub that Luke found for Dustin and Lindsay and like the numbers were so good that they actually like spent some time thinking about it, even though they weren't nightclub goers.  So, um, yeah. Okay. Financial services. Okay. A lot of people. Be interested in accounting, but they aren't accountants. It's a tough one because when most accountants only want to sell to accountants, so that's one of those where it can be an issue.  And then financial services, some of these things do require licenses and stuff. Most people skip over this unless they're in real estate and they're interested in mortgage.  Insurance agencies can also be an interesting one too and an interesting roll-up strategy, but I haven't seen too many people select anything in here.  We need to separate this out. Sorry, I thought, you know, we were going to separate healthcare and fitness out.  So we need to separate. this out, right? Because healthcare is dealing with insurance, it's licensing, etc. Fitness is a completely different, no license required.  So this can be confusing when people go through it. It looks like we did, we just haven't changed the name of the, oh wait, gyms, fitness services, you know, yoga up there, like we can create its own fitness category.  And I think that would be better. Because a lot of this stuff is going to require a medical license.  And if they don't have one, hair removal, that should go into beauty services. So let's just go through this and double check.  Yeah, everything else, pretty much, esthetician might be beauty treatments, actually. Weight loss, cold sculpting, let's put that into beauty.

1:09:08 - R Cash
  Probably a lot of that stuff on recreation that would probably fall under fitness if that category was there.

1:09:17 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, personal training, anything that doesn't require a medical license, it's an activity, like let's pull that into a fitness category.  And then things that are, like hair removal doesn't require a medical license, it's like a beauty treatment, right? Dermatologist is a doctor, so that can stay here.  Cosmetic and plastic surgery can stay here. But like cool sculpting, weight loss, esthetician, that's all kind of like beauty treatments.  I would put that in beauty treatments probably, because it's not requiring a medical license. Does that make sense, Ida?  Okay, so then if they select things. In here, right, then I would want to know their familiarity with the medical industry.  With the medical industry, you know, there's this whole like insurance compliance element to it that if they don't have familiarity with that, then I would be wary to put something in front of them for this.  Um, but if they do, like a lot of people are like, yeah, I worked in, uh, like a healthcare company that dealt with insurance all the time.  I see that as a huge opportunity for me to do it better, or I know the insurance industry and how to do that.  And it's like, okay, but then we have the licensing thing that we need to think about there. But like, if they select things, if they are interested in these categories, just talk through that and their familiarity to those industries.
  ACTION ITEM: Update business characteristics questionnaire - remove duplicates, separate fitness from healthcare, move breweries to food/drink
 - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/371035470?timestamp=4264.9999  Um. And. And. Okay, manufacturing. Breweries needs to go in food and drink, not in manufacturing. It's also in food and drink.

1:11:13 - Ida Badenhorst
  It's in both sides.

1:11:15 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay, so we need to eliminate doubles too, Ida.

1:11:19 - Ida Badenhorst
  Okay. So if something appears somewhere, it should only appear once because that's confusing as we go through two.

1:11:25 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So just have another go through everything and make sure that we only have one industry selection throughout here.

1:11:34 - R Cash
  Do really have anyone trying to buy a charity?

1:11:39 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  No, the reason why I put it in here is to unearth any misunderstandings, right? It hasn't happened to memory, but I put it in here because there was a misunderstanding of whether charities could be sold or transferred over.  They can't. So, you know, it's like if they're like, yeah, I would really like a charity. It's like, okay, well, you can't actually buy charities.  They're not able to be handed over, whatever. I know it's a random thing, but I'm just trying to unearth if there's some education I need to do there about charities.  And then franchises we get into a little bit later. We can probably even eliminate this category because I feel like we touch on franchises down below.  Okay. I think you guys are getting the flavor. I don't want to go through like every single one of these categories.  Food, restaurants and food. I will say though, like most of the time they'll eliminate everything and actually like food production, like co-packing facilities and stuff like that could be really interesting.  I've vending machines. Also, I've seen, you know, if somebody has quite a few of them and has had set up the whole system and everything.  Um, so if they select no, understand why. And they're like, most of the time it's just like, oh, I've heard hospitality is like not good.  And it's like, okay, but if we put something in front of you that was, how would that change things?  Or would you be interested in like food packaging or production, et cetera? Um, service businesses. Okay, cool. So we've separated out service businesses and services to homes.  Let's make sure there's not duplication here, Ida. Yeah.

1:13:50 - R Cash
  Home services was my favorite. I think, uh, I saw psychic as a category. We've actually seen psychic.

1:13:59 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Psych. I businesses for sale.

1:14:01 - R Cash
  I love it. Like, please send them my way and I'll just start rolling up psychic hotlines. Like, I love everything about that.

1:14:15 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Awesome. Okay, cool. So let's get that cleaned up. Anke, can you double check that for me, please, that we're, that Ida has the support she needs to go through this?  Do you guys have any questions about the categories themselves and how to run through those? You'll see, I mean, you've seen us do it on the calls and you'll be on calls, but any questions on that section?  No? Okay, cool. So then some of these questions feel like maybe we're asking the same things, but just asking it in different ways.  Like, what's their preferences, you know, product versus service business, talk through this with them, online business. They put it up above, but like, you know, there's online businesses that are specifically like KDP, et cetera, et cetera.  And then there's remote businesses. Again, I want to find out how they feel about like being in a place versus having a remote team.  I want to talk through, I feel like we asked this up above, so we might need to look at this one too, but just talk through, you know, what situations that they might be open to that.  Um, business characteristics is important too, because, um, some people have a preference for like B2B clients or they'll want B2C clients, or they'll be open to both.  Um, but you want to uncover any biases around that before you get into it, because if they're like, I don't really want to walk with, work with general public, you know, um, for example.  For low ticket things for consumers, somebody like we had a client that was like cleaning low ticket level, not of interest for me, but doing like big project level things for consumers is of interest, right?  So like kind of talking through the nuances of these selections, like under what situations would you be able to do it?  And, you know, if they have any other preferences that we should be aware of, right? Some people have really thought about who they want the target customer to be.  So we just need to uncover if they have strong preferences, it's going to end up being influencing their decisions down the line.  The competition thing, it's wild. Like if we don't talk about this, then they'll be like, oh, I, you know, there's no moat, there's no moat, there's no moat.  It's like, well, no, like most businesses aren't going to have a moat, right? If you're, if you're dealing in like landscaping or whatever, they might have a slight moat.  But, but this will be something. That can end up holding them back. They'll be looking for like this, this unicorn that doesn't necessarily exist.  So this is where, you know, we're just kind of uncovering a little bit more the licenses thing here. You know, how long, sometimes they're like, if it hasn't been in existence for longer than 10 years, I won't consider it.  And it's like, well, why? Oh, that's what I heard on the internet, you know? And it's like, okay, but if something has been in existence for three to five years, and there's a genuinely good reason for why someone's selling, would you be open to it, right?  So you want to hear their reasons for why they choose all of these things, because we've seen this be something that will block them from actually considering a deal, because they just are afraid that they're making the wrong decision if they look at something less than 10 years, because they heard that's what they're supposed to be looking for.  So that's where all these questions are coming from, is kind of like unearthing any... any preferences or assumptions that they have.  The real estate thing, also interesting to find out what their comfort level is with real estate. I think if it's available and it's necessary for the business, they should buy it because it's going to be priced typically in a way that the rent payment and the mortgage payment should be, you know, not that dissimilar.  Um, so them having a landlord in a place that they require versus a mortgage, but like, you kind of want to find out what their familiarity and comfort level is in this, you know, let's remove that.  Um, some of them want real estate. Some of them only want deals that have real estate. And again, we need to talk through that.  So we're just asking it in a couple of different ways. Um, again, owner involvement, it's going to be what it's going to be.  But clients will sometimes have this idea that if it's not. Not outright offered that the owner will stay on for a certain amount of time that they'll eliminate it.  So again, it's, these are coaching moments. And you guys probably have seen that in the calls, you know, so far, and you'll see that.  Okay. Any questions on the questionnaire? Good. Okay. Um, then we're going to go into their acquisition experience and past deal evaluation.  So I've pulled this first part out of part one. And the purpose here is to understand what they've done so far so that we can know where we need to start filling in the gaps or pushing them, right?  Many have signed NDAs, reviewed SIMs, but not actually gotten on broker calls. Um, let's add that in. Okay. If they haven't had those calls, that's what we need to be getting them on.  Because that is where they're going to get the most experience, right? So like, we're just going to remind them if they're like, oh, I haven't had any broker calls and be like, that's okay.  Our recommendation, you know, when you start this process is that every deal we put in front of you, get on a broker call and we're going to talk you through how to do that.  Just getting an idea of what their deal experience is, what they're comfortable with so far. And then if they have gone through like an LOI or they've had a broker call, you know, whatever the furthest that they've gotten to, I want to go through each of those in detail and figure out what they liked about it, why they were moving forward on that business, what happened with it.  So you might not need to ask all these questions exactly for it, but depending on how they answer up here.  If they're like, yeah, I've submitted two LOIs. It's like, okay, let's go through each of those deals. The first LOI that you submitted, what was the business?  Okay. What did you like about the business? What did you dislike? What influenced you to proceed or not proceed?  How did you evaluate it? What were the key factors that made you feel this way? Are there any experiences or beliefs from this deal that you think will influence future decisions?  What did you learn from it, right? So starting to get in their head of like how they made decisions to move forward on a deal, how they were analyzing it, what happened, right?  Why it didn't go forward. A lot of times they don't see that it was them, right? That was the reason why it didn't.  Oh, the broker just ghosted me. After you submitted an LOI, you know, like you were making an offer. Why did they ghost you?  Or, and they're like, oh, I submitted an LOI before I even talked to the broker. It's like, okay, there's a learning there, right?  Um, so just kind of getting an idea of what their experience is. And then when we close it out, we just want to, you know, be like, okay, reminder, here's what's going to happen next.  We're going to start your SBA pre-qualification. There's a lot to do here, documents to fill out, interviews with the lender.  We cannot start your search without this pre-qualification. You guys need to make sure you say this, right? Because there's a lot of work to do and we will push back their search start until we have that piece of paper.  Um, but it's not fair for us to do that without saying it to them. So we need to reiterate it on the call.  Like, hey, make sure you jump on that. We need that to get your search started. Then we're going to schedule your location mapping call.  We'll go through all your geographical preferences and you'll get your deal box and buyer profile to review and sign off.  Any questions before we wrap up? Okay, great. So you just make sure you give them the opportunity to ask questions.  Um, So in this quick access coaching guide, there's just little scripts in here. Read through these so you can have them in your back pocket.  And then I'd love for us, like I said, to just keep adding things in here that it was like, oh, that was a cool thing that I did to get them to like open up or redirect or look at an industry differently.  So just grab those conversations that you have and those notes that you see me do or that you guys end up doing so that we all get better collectively at how we're running through this process.  Okay. Questions, thoughts?

1:23:47 - R Cash
  I think it's pretty clear. It's like anything, just going to take a couple of reps to make sure to just get it dialed in.

1:23:58 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah. Thanks for walking us to that, Athena. I think the best way to learn is just watching all the other deal box discovery sessions.  You'll learn how it goes, see how Athena did it.

1:24:07 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah. So the only thing that I feel like is lost there, and this is something I picked up when I handed over the sales process to Austin, is the context, right?  Like the reason why we're asking those questions and the reason why we're doing those things. So that's what I wanted you guys to get through today.  So if you were to summarize the purpose of this call for us, what would you guys say it is?

1:24:34 - Luke Gillespie
  Learning how the client thinks and why they're thinking what they're thinking, so we can observe patterns, red flags, roadblocks that we're going to need to flag right down in our notes for when we're searching for them, and also some things that we know we're going to have to teach them on, some teaching moments, some education moments.

1:24:51 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, great. How about you?

1:24:53 - R Cash
  I'd like say there's also some expectation setting as well, like getting ahead of expectations. you. Yeah, good cash.

1:25:01 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah.

1:25:02 - Charis Siau
  Yeah, I think the teaching is huge, you know, especially for first time entrepreneurs that are looking for acquisition. They're with Aquamatch so that they can have that guidance.  A lot of times, I don't think they're confident enough just on their own because they, sure, I mean, a lot of people do that.  They do their own self-funded search, self-guided search, but they're with us to, you know, be those bumpers along the way to help them keep on score of what will truly, you know, be successful for them.

1:25:38 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, all good and right, you know, and the other thing is like they get to choose what they're interested in.  So we're kind of like, like if you could wave a magic wand, what would the business be? And sometimes I ask that question, you know, we didn't get to it, Charis, in the, this, this session with Jenny and Matt, but that hobbies.  An interest section is like one of my favorites and one of the most important, because that's when you see them start to light up.  So regardless of whether we find them a business in one of their hobby interest areas, we want that kind of reaction.  So it's like, now we have an anchor of what that excitement reaction is from them, you know? And then it's like, if we're not seeing that in a deal, then we can be like, hey, you lit up about this thing on one of our first calls.  You're not lighting up about this business. Like, what about this business is making you feel like this is the one I want to get married to for 10 years?  And I will play devil's advocate and I'll, you know, and like, just be like, beyond the numbers, what is it about this business that's getting you out of bed?  You know, because sometimes they'll get dazzled by the numbers or the potential, all the things that they could do to the business, you know?  Um, so we have that like emotional anchor moment too, but also, you know, going through this, it's like, okay, we can, you don't have to look at businesses you're not interested in.  Like that's part of the. That's part about it. So, you know, it's for us not wasting time putting businesses in front of them that they automatically eliminate, but also like, okay, this was a gray area, or I think I can stress test this so I can put something in front of them maybe they wouldn't have thought of, you know, before and get excited about an area maybe that they didn't think of.  That's kind of the fun, I think, with what you guys get to do is you get to think outside of their box.  Okay, awesome. I know I said we were going to take a quick break, but I want to give me and Cash time to regroup.
  ACTION ITEM: Share updated client meeting template w/ analysts
 - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/371035470?timestamp=5272.9999  So you guys cool to go for another 15 minutes? Sweet. Thank you. All right. Thank you. Anke, let's send them the client meeting template separately so that they can read through that.  And then let's go through a write-up. I don't know where to find our sample write-up. I'll give it to you.  I just saw your comment. I've never seen a car wash that cash flows on me either, which is why it's very questionable why somebody that's making millions of dollars off selling business acquisitions is talking about car washes, but whatever.

1:28:54 - Luke Gillespie
  I have the link as well, Anke, if you want me to send that right now.

1:28:57 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  I got it. The one I did. Oh, sorry.

1:28:59 - Luke Gillespie
  All right.

1:29:00 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  No, I'm going to use the sample one.

1:29:04 - Anke Jordaan
  Athena, had Luke update it so it looks like the new structure we're doing in our current write-ups.
  SCREEN SHARING: Athena started screen sharing - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/371035470?timestamp=5348.778012

1:29:10 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So it is the sample one, but updated to the new structure. Oh, I didn't want that because I actually want to stop some of the things that Luke is doing.  Okay, so let's, I just want to talk through like why we do the write-up the way that we do.  Um, we started doing these video walkthroughs because the clients were diving deep into the business and not really understanding like why we chose the business for them.  So Luke does an exceptional job of like hyping the business, talking through any nuances. So when we send a write-up over to somebody, you know, this video is basically your pitch on the business.  Um, and when we started doing this, we got a lot less clients wanting to eliminate a deal after the fact.  So. So. So, you know, I think keeping it within a couple minutes if you can, unless there's a lot of nuances that can't be described in the write-ups, but it's basically like your pitch, why this business is for them, anything that they need to be aware of.  And then what we include here is, you know, important links that they may need, the links to the sim and the financials that we get.  But this is so they can dive into all the materials that we have. The link to the broker call is a really great thing that we offer because it allows them to learn through us the way that we ask questions, the type of questions that we're asking, how we handle the broker.  It's as much as giving them information as them being able to listen in and learn. It's something that Luke gets a lot of compliments about from clients in how he handles those broker calls, but it gives them all of the information.  So that they're picking up where we left off. And I think the brokers appreciate that they're not having to repeat themselves.  When our clients show up on the broker calls, they're asking different questions, right? They're moving it forward. They're able to move very fast.  When you get the broker calls, it's really important to ask for permission. And Luke has a lot of experience doing that.  So sometimes the brokers won't give permission. Company website, if we have it. These top line calculations, I want to stop doing this, Luke.  I just want to do asking price, unless the asking price is like completely ridiculous. But let's stop. I think it's a little bit confusing to them to do like 10% below asking, because it's very rare that we would do that if their multiple is like reasonable.  So I don't want to plant seed early on. But I think you were doing it to help them when the multiples are like crazy.  So we can do a second calculation. When, when it's like, you know, we're seeing like a five multiple or whatever.  Um, and then we're going to start, you know, Luke and I are experimenting with this valuation tool, which we're, I don't know if we're going to have time today, but I want to show you guys, because I think we can start, if we dial that in internally for, we're like, okay, this feels pretty spot on.  Then we can do this based on what we think the multiple is. So that, that's the intention behind that valuation tool, Luke is, um, and it's really cool.  I'll, I'll, um, show you guys and, and Charis and Cash, I'm sure you probably have a lot of experience for like valuing businesses also.  But when I'm thinking about multiples, it's like, well, between three and four is usually where it lands with an SBA deal.  That's, you know, decent and profitable, but a multiple like out there in the ether doesn't mean much. But when we have.  So personal preferences and things that get us excited or not excited about a deal, then giving the clients a tool for them to do their own assessment on how they would score the business.  Because right now they're like, how should I price this? And I'm like, it's kind of personal to you, right?  Like what you feel is like juice is worth the squeeze. So we're working on this valuation tool. But anyways, I won't get into that now.  So let's remove the second one unless the asking price is just crazy. And then the reason why we would put in a lower one is so that they don't freak out when they see.  This top line calculation is super rough. And we tell clients that. You guys are going to see that on the new client orientation next week.  But like, this is just to give them an idea of what might be left after loan payments, revenue, SDE, what the margin is, what the asking price is multiple, including our fees, you know, additional deal costs, what the total project costs.  And then based on just what the going SBA rate is with nothing else, what might their loan payments, debt service coverage ratio, and amount after loan.  So this is giving a top line taster of the financials, but we have the modeling spreadsheet that if they like a deal, we need them to work on that because that's going to be a lot more nuanced to them in this particular deal.  So like Luke, you saw Peter started using this and I was like, what is he doing? So like if clients do that and try to use this to decide their calculations, we need to push them to using the actual financial modeling template because I would never feel comfortable with somebody making an offer based on this alone.  They need to do all the other stuff, right? But this is the number that they look at immediately. They go down to this.  What are they going to make after the loan payments? And this is pre-tax. Also. So then in the spreadsheet, it's post-tax.  So that's the important nuance there is like, this is the pre-tax number to them. And then we get into, okay, this is how it's described in the SIM, right?  So they can see how, you know, without having to dig into the SIM. But then this is like why we think this business is a good fit for them.  So this, like this example isn't really nailing it, but the reason why we like this business for the client, this is like our paragraph pitch about this business for the client, right?  So why this business for you? Well, you said you like this and this business has its characteristics or the outgoing owner is really process driven.  And we know that you're a project manager. So it feels like there's an interesting fit there. Plus it has all these other characteristics, right?  It's a top-level pitch about the business specific to this client. Then we get into specific sections, and the purpose of this is to give them a top-line overview.  And what we want them to do is to read this in full before they start diving into broker calls, SIMS, et cetera, et cetera, so they don't get new analysis paralysis.  They get the top line, okay, this is what we like about it. So why we like the business, what are the good things about this business, what makes it strong, what are our concerns?  What are the things that they should be aware of that are concerns? Hey, we're edging towards some customer concentration.  Brokers or the owner's pretty heavily involved, so you're going to have to extract him from the business. So it's calling out the things that could be deterrents but not deal breakers.  Then we always look at opportunities for growth, right? Okay, so with a new... New owner, new energy. What are the things that you could potentially do?  We always say we don't buy a business based on potential, but it's a really exciting part for most people.  So it's like we want them to, when they're buying a business, if absolutely nothing changed, would it work for them?  Yes. The answer should always be yes. And if I were able to apply all my like superpowers to this business, where could I get some upside?  Most of our clients are disillusioned by not being able to make decisions in their day-to-day like business life and their careers.  So they want something like this, but we can't put a business in front of them where the only way for them to get upside is to grow it.  So we kind of get them excited about the potential here. There are going to be things that you're not able to get clarification on the things you see in the financials, things that the broker's like, I don't know, you're going to have to ask the owner, which happens.  All the time, doesn't it, Luke? Like the brokers have very limited, deep knowledge of the business. So you guys are only getting on the broker call.  You're not speaking to the owner. So this is where you want to call out anything that you weren't able to get clarity on.  It, A, teaches them where they need to look for clarity, and B, shows them that we've done everything we possibly can to the limit of how we service them.  What you don't want to do is know that, hey, they need to have these conversations with the owner. They need to get clarity on these certain things, but we didn't call it out for them.  You know, so that's how we're advising them is like, we might not have the ability to get the answers, but we can tell them what answers they should start thinking about getting early on.  And then additional information, you know, just things that don't necessarily fit in here, but, you know, good for them to know.  So, okay. Hey, it's been pre-approved. That's great when we see a pre-approval from SBA because it means they've taken a look at the business and the asking price and the numbers kind of work.  And then always telling them what the next steps are. So this is, you know, when there's a business that's like a hot mover and there's a lot of offers already in, like stating this, making sure you're saying it in the write-up, you know, like in the write-up and when you present the write-up to them, like, hey, this is a hot one.  You need to jump on it quick. In the service agreements for all the new clients coming on and new clients being those that started last Friday going forward, it says that they need to respond within 24 hours to us.  Previous clients don't have that. We're trying to emphasize that, right? Like time kills all deals, especially on market deals if there's competition.  What you want to do on those calls is assess the competition and the timeliness for the client because we're taking...  Usually one to two weeks of deal time doing our process. So that means that they need to move really quick usually because other people have had two weeks with the deal.  So the purpose of this is, you know, to give them a top line overview, but also for us to do a top line analysis.  We're not getting it. We're not going to be doing like forecasting calculations and that sort of thing. But like things that you see in there, like Cash, you picked up on some really good things that I don't think we'd picked up on before.  I can't remember specifically what it was from that deal. But, you know, that's where you could list those things and concerns.  Like, hey, I saw this thing. Broker wasn't able to answer it. That is a concern I have. Right. Like highlighting where the risk might be.  Now, the thing that Luke got really good at was. Because if you put a whole bunch of concerns without talking about how they could potentially overcome it, they'll just not want to move forward on it.  They'll get scared. Right? So there's a difference between deal adjustments and deal breakers. There's always a way to mitigate risk if it's not fraud or declining industry or declining revenue or like something materially bad with the business.  We shouldn't be putting businesses in front of clients that have those things anyway. So if it's just a bad business, we shouldn't be putting in front of them.  But every business is going to have warts. We need to call out the warts and also reassure them about the warts.  Like, hey, there's some customer concentration here, but we can use a forgivable note to account for that and mitigate the risk for you.  And we'll get into more of the structuring and that sort of thing. But what I wanted to do was just kind of talk you through just the anatomy of a write-up.  This is the thing that you guys will be purchasing lots of. Luke's. It's probably done hundreds of these by now.  And when you go through the playbook, you know, this is ultimately what we're getting to. Now, I also want to say for Cash and Charis, like, we don't want to use AI for your analysis, right?  Because that should be coming from you and learning before you outsource to any AI. So I want to just, this needs to be kind of analog in the things that you are identifying.  So I just want to make that clear because we are an AI friendly company in a lot of ways.  I think Anke went through our AI policy last night. For me, this AI is not doing your thinking for you.  It's just helping you move quicker. So I like learning things analog before you outsource to AI so that you know.  What the outputs should be looking like, and you can test that. Additionally, some of these things might be good for summarizing writing and stuff, but those key concerns, the ops for growth, the nuances of the things that you're talking about with brokers, usually AI can take all that out or not explain it the way that you would.  So I just wanted to call that out and make it clear that we want to do this analog while we're learning our own kind of analysis muscle and getting on the same page for how we do this.  Any questions on, I mean, obviously there's a lot of questions in terms of like how you get one of these, the whole process and everything, which is going to be shared, but the overall like write-up presented to the client.  In that way, does that, does that make sense? Why we do it in that format? Any questions on that?  Cool. I have one question.

1:44:06 - Charis Siau
  Yeah. If a broker, you know, is not comfortable with the call being recorded, is that just like, yep, okay, you know, I'll, you know, and then you don't record the call and do you provide like a summary or anything instead of the link to the recording or how do we handle that?

1:44:29 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Luke has a lot more experience with this than I do. So are you, are you telling him at the beginning, Luke, or are you just asking him at the end if you can share the notes?

1:44:39 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah, it's all included in the playbook. You ask to record first in the beginning, then you ask for consent at the end.  Normally they'll always let you record and use the note taker. If they're not okay with sharing the recording, what I do is in that additional info section that you saw at the bottom of the write-up.  So when you are able to share the recording in the write-up, you don't need to take super detailed notes from the broker call there because lot Thank  The client's going to listen to the call and just write down the highlights. When you're not able to share the recording, that additional info session, I write down like every conversation that took place on that broker call, give them as detailed notes as possible.  So that's normally how I play that.

1:45:15 - Charis Siau
  Is that clear? Do you need any more details? Cool. Yeah, that's good for now. Thank you. We're going to do a lot of objection handling when you guys start doing calls.

1:45:25 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So Luke's got a ton of experience in this, but there's, you know, I'm always thinking of like, and you've been on the broker side.  So I think you're going to like be able to alleviate a lot of concerns there and be like, Hey, I've been in your seat.  Like, trust me, this means that our clients are going to pick up where I left off and be able to like move even quicker.  Or, you know, so like, I always just think of like, how can I reframe it into why it's a benefit to them?  Like, Hey, you know, totally get it. But, you know, we found that this, this helps them actually. Like move quicker in the process.  So they're not asking you the same questions that I asked you. You know, it depends. And it's all going to be dependent on how much of a rapport that you've built with them.  Some of them are crunchy at first. And then when you bring like a legitimately great client, then they're like, oh, this is great.  Like, let's work together more, you know? So we're new. Like what we've done is like not out. What we do is not out there.  There's like advisory search services that do off market. There's by-side brokers. But like advisors that help people with on market doesn't really exist.  So they, you know, especially the old school ones that have maybe had by-side brokers try to split fees with them, or they're just inundated with a whole bunch of tire kickers.  And they're like, what the  is this? Just another thing that I have to deal with, you know? Like it depends.  So usually like building the rapport can end up getting them like much more comfortable with our process. But sometimes it's like going through it once.  And then you When you're in the same market, you'll probably deal with the same broker like multiple times. But yeah, the objection handling will be fun when we start getting you guys on broker calls, which I think we're hoping for next week.  Is that when we want to start doing it, Anke?

1:47:16 - Anke Jordaan
  Yeah. Cool.

1:48:24 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So I'm going to tell him that we're going to start having you. So just have a review of the client meeting format.  And then we'll do some live meetings together. And then once we get all through these onboardings, I'll have more time to actually work with you guys on some of this stuff.  So I'm sorry, my spare time is so limited right now. So I'm having to kind of get Anke to spend a lot of time with you.  And then we'll go through nuance, theory, context. We'll spend a lot more time on all that, doing deal reviews on the write-ups, structuring all the stuff that you guys are going to need to fill in the gaps.  But anything that you're feeling like you need more... ... ... ... Time with or more explanation of, like just start noting that down so that I can plan our training sessions accordingly too.  And Anke and I will be able to divvy up like what can she do and what needs to sit with me.

1:49:13 - Luke Gillespie
  But how are you guys feeling about everything? Still drinking through a fire hose? Yeah, it's great. Athena, wanted to ask, since we're wrapping up the meeting here, what action items or deliverables are there for us, the analysts, to do before we have that client call on Wednesday or before my next buyer deal box discovery call I have with Josh, Keith, and you next Wednesday?

  Any action items, deliverables, any documents to review, anything from Anke? Good. Anke's going to do another training with you guys on actually preparing for the second call.

Like for Justin specifically, we'll want to talk through Ogden Power Sports.

1:50:12 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah.

1:50:14 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  And if any clients are circling deals or if there's any updates, and I kind of like to tease them a little bit with what's to come, too.  You'll know that better. Like, hey, we've got a new influx of deals. It's going to be coming, et cetera.  So, but yeah, for Cash and Charis, it's just kind of understanding the agenda and being there and me introducing you to the clients.  And so they start to get used to you. They already know Luke. So, yeah.
