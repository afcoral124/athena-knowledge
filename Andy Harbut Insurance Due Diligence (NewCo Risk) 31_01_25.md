# AcquiMatch 31/01/25

[00:00:00] 

**Athena:** Hey, Joe. See you. Thank you. You're just, uh, logging on. Hey, looks like it might just be you today. So you're getting a VIP insurance. Uh, get down and Andy was just saying we could dig into your deal if there's time at the end, too 

**Joe:** Wow, all right. Well apologies and like the traveling salesman I am I just got in my car and i'm well north of town So if you don't mind me, uh watching slash listening in, um, yeah, i'm just gonna be on the road, but i'll be safe So don't worry about me 

**Athena:** No worries.

Yeah, we're recording the presentation because I know a bunch of folks had to work and weren't able to make it today. And he's got some amazing information. And then, as usual, we'll dig into discussion and conversation after he's kind of presented the, the basics and the overview and everything. So, yeah, do you think Joe and then [00:01:00] we'll hand over to Andy.

So, um, just to introduce Andy for Joe and then and then the folks that are watching this back. Um. Andy. I actually got introduced to his business partner quite a long time ago and was absolutely fascinated with, um, what the 2 of these guys do. Um, and I didn't realize just how essential it is to really deeply understand the insurance.

Of the business that you were taking over, and also as a business owner, the types of coverage that you're going to need. Uh, and what's even more fascinating, which I'm, I'm sure we'll dig into much more deeply, is that depending on what the current owner did with their situation, they might have been, you know.

Grossly under covered or they might have things that are going to come up that are going to be, you know, uh, hits to the bank account later down the line. So actually involving folks like this in your process can materially [00:02:00] change, you know, the or, or, uh, help you in that process or just know what's coming down the track.

And then also making sure that you have the appropriate coverage in place and spot things that might be additional risk that you didn't even realize were there. Okay. Um, and Josh and Andy specialize in people that are acquiring businesses. So this is their part of the world that they are really good at.

They are, as far as I know, like the only people that really specialize in this for searchers and are very highly regarded in the community, highly recommended. Uh, I have loved any, every interaction that I've had with them. So really, really grateful that Andy is here and spending the time with us. to teach us about this really cool, uh, process that, that they do, uh, for searchers specifically when they're taking over businesses.

So, uh, Andy, I will hand over to you. 

**Andy:** Thank you very much. Uh, Joe, a pleasure to meet you. And, uh, [00:03:00] it's, it's funny. I took a call this morning where I put my phone behind my steering wheel, uh, as I drove, so I could look through my steering wheel and talk to the folks. So don't, don't worry about being in the car, but, uh, great to meet you.

**Joe:** That's pretty good. Hey, this is what I look like. Okay, man. Yeah, I'm holding it to my side, but I'm gonna go back up. I've thought of doing the steering wheel thing before. It doesn't work well. And I don't like the holders either, so. 

**Andy:** It could get pretty dicey. Yeah, don't worry about it. The good news for you is, uh, I'm not particularly heavy on visuals today, so you're going to get just as much from the conversation.

You 

**Joe:** don't want to see me anyways. Alright, man. Thanks for attending today. I appreciate it. 

**Andy:** Yeah, you got it. It's my pleasure. Honestly, that's, uh, A heck of an intro, Athena. I'm going to probably have to ask you to roll that back in the future because I don't know how I'm going to live up to it, but I'm flattered and I appreciate it.

Um, and I think it's probably safe to just start with saying, you know, um, [00:04:00] real quick, my, my background is I started doing insurance due diligence for private equity firms, um, about 20 years ago. And I, and I spent the first 17 years or so in my career doing insurance diligence for private equity buyouts.

And about three years ago, I discovered searching E. T. A. With my business partner, Josh Richmond and started working probably 90 percent searching E. T. A. We still do work for private equity firms and independent sponsors. Um, but I'm not, you know, if if I'm honest, not really passionate about it still, while that got recorded, but it's it's a lot more satisfying for me to work with somebody who's Um, you know, it's your livelihood, right?

This is going to be your, your business and, uh, the impact of what we do, I think is much more meaningful. Um, so that's, that's why we do it, but the, the, I think just to set the tone for the conversation to, um, and I might throw up my deck just to not have to stare at my face if I may. There we go. [00:05:00] Um, Josh and I, as Athena mentioned, we were, um, part of Symphony Risk.

Is that, is that working? Is the share working? Can you all see? Yeah, I can. It says NewCoRisk. Yep, exactly. So, we, um, we met at Symphony Risk, which was a, or is a private equity owned insurance broker. Um, and, uh, about six months ago, I had the idea that, gosh, it'd be great if we, you know, we mostly work with search and E.

T. A. Um, we're W. Two guys at Symphony. I thought it was a little inauthentic. So we went to our board with a proposal to carve out. And, uh, as Athena mentioned, we literally, um, we bought our clients from Symphony and at the same time, um, about four months ago, started doing all the things that you need to do to launch an insurance broker.

So, um, it's, it's been really interesting. It's like [00:06:00] a little bit of ETA and a little bit of a startup, right, right from, you know, ground up DeNovo business. Um, And so this is actually the first time I've seen these slides that our designer got back for us today. I think they look okay. So we're, what is insurance diligence?

Why do you do it? Why does it matter that if I had to break it down very simply, it's to keep you from buying a company and finding out after you buy the company that, gosh, these insurance costs are going to change radically. Or so that's number one, this sort of evaluation component of it. And the thing about insurance diligence is that it's not picked up by QV.

It's not picked up by the legal teams. Um, the nature of insurance is it's so, uh, it's so darn, um, you know, specific, I guess. And, and, uh, as a discipline, it's not something that folks who are outside of insurance typically understand. And so the [00:07:00] kinds of issues we can identify are generally not picked up by legal or QV.

So sort of number one is valuation. And the other thing that seems pretty obvious when it struck me like a lightning bolt a couple years ago, insurance is really this, this, uh, addresses asymmetrical business risk. Right? And so mostly when people talk about, hey, what kind of business do you want to buy?

And you'll hear people talk about asymmetrical risk and they want to have more upside than downside. The funny thing about insurance is that you've got basically unlimited downside. And so we're talking about protecting the business from liability, third party liability, um, which, you know, conceivably is unlimited, um, and protecting the business if there's tangible assets, uh, protecting those assets from, from things like fire and windstorm and all the things that can, can really ruin your day.

Um, So just if you think about it that in those terms, protecting your [00:08:00] valuation, making sure you're expected insurance expenses is a good qualified vetted number. Um, and then the fact that if you don't get insurance, right, you're going to have. You know, potentially this unlimited exposure. That's why we do it.

The one other thing that is really common, particularly in E. T. A. Insurance pal in a lot of cases in E. T. A. Um, the transaction structure is an asset deal versus a stock deal or a membership interest or unit purchase. Right? So if it's an asset only deal. Um, which, which people commonly do for tax reasons.

Insurance policies can't be assigned. Uh, and so you'll find that you need new insurance policies to close. There are so many horror stories about people, searchers not knowing that, gosh, we have to get new insurance policies to close. They find that out, you know, a week ahead of time and it turns into a mad dash at the end.

Um, or they find that for some [00:09:00] reason, maybe they'll try to work with the seller's insurance broker and they find that Yeah. The cost changed radically. They had no idea why they just didn't see it coming. So a big part of what we do besides the valuation issues and the protection from on the downside, really, the third leg of that is just making sure you have a smooth transaction and a smooth closing and making sure that all the insurance is in place ready to go at close.

Um, if you're using SBA financing or any financing, really the lender is going to want. Insurance documentation at close, and we do all that too. So pause

starting with an example. What kinds of things do we find? Um, just to bring this, this make it a little more tangible and concrete, we worked on a deal. Um, I guess it was almost 2 years ago, but that's when we got up here, it was a roofer and the roofing company was a paper [00:10:00] GC, if you will, where they're all their work was, um, they're really only had two W2 employees.

And we looked at the, there's sort of 2 examples here. The first is, is it, can we find upside for you? And so in some cases we can, in some cases, the seller might not. Have a good handle on insurance. Their broker might not have looked at it recently. Um, and we can find that the company is overpaying for insurance.

And so this roofing business we looked at, um, did a lot of work as a subcontractor for general contractors. And we literally, we look at the contracts in place with the GCs and with the subs, depending on what the business is doing. And we found that this roofing company was covered as a subcontractor by the general contractors insurance program for approximately 30 percent of the work they did.

All their new construction work was covered There's a [00:11:00] subcontractor to GC. The GC had what's called a wrap up insurance program, um, which when there's a wrap up insurance program that covers all the subs. And so when we looked at that, we said, gosh, do you guys realize that, you know, 3 million of your revenue is covered under these master programs?

And they had no idea. And when we looked at their general liability insurance, the premium was predicated on full, the full 10 million in sales. And so it was. Great, because we're able to relate replace the general liability policy at close for the buyers and at a pretty significant cost savings because this other insurance was already in place through the to the master program.

But there's a downside to this one to that, where we see, we see the hidden risks. Right. And so this this this is really memorable I don't I don't know if you guys have seen decks like this but. Um, in the last couple of [00:12:00] years, there seems to be a trend to moving employees from W2 status to 1099 independent contractor status.

And in this particular deal, it was like page 4 or 5 of the deck, um, talking about the business and how they had de risked their Employee injury exposure because they moved everybody from W two status to 10 99. And so it's, you know, the pitch is, hey, this company is great. They don't have any employees.

They're not on the hook for workers, compensation, insurance. Um, you don't have to worry about employees getting injured. Well, one of the things we do is to look at the loss history for the insurance policies and something to keep in mind, which is sort of intuitive if you think about it. But if you're looking at an insurance policy and it's.

In force today, um, any claims that happened during the current policy year don't impact the pricing until the next policy year. [00:13:00] And so when we looked at the last runs. For this company that purports to only have 1099s, no direct roofers on payroll, we saw claims that arose from their subcontractors and the how that works out is if you're an employer or a business and you hire a subcontractor to do work for you at your behest and direction.

And that that subcontractor doesn't have their own insurance for workers compensation, which is statutory required in every state except for Texas. Um, that subcontractor can still bring a claim against the employer's policy, even though they're 10 99. And so this, this sort of arbitrary distinction of, well, we're paying them this 10 99 W twos.

It doesn't hold up if the company If the employer doesn't have the appropriate contractual measures in place, and if they're not verifying that the subcontractors have insurance, [00:14:00] so. This is a case of the SIM says 1 thing. If you looked at the P and L, you'd see a lower insurance costs because of these workers compensation claims weren't showing up on the policy yet.

But when we actually looked at the claims that were happening during that policy period, we knew that the next year, the company was going to wind up having to basically pay for compensation insurance for all these subcontractors using air quotes for that because of subcontractors didn't have their own coverage.

I'm gonna, I'm gonna pause anybody hit. I don't know. I do have an audience. Does anyone have any questions?

**Joe:** Oh, this is Joe. I'm following. 

**Andy:** Yeah, I never know. That's that's kind of a complicated example, but it's so meaningful that. Kind of leave with that one. Um, but there's, there's a whole host of issues. It just starts spitballing the kinds of things we see when we do insurance [00:15:00] diligence that, um, just don't get picked up by QV, by legal, by commercial diligence.

Um, just one, one more example, because it just happened last week, working with a guy who's buying a, um, commercial kitchen distributor company. And so they distribute commercial ovens and, um, all the stuff you can think of being a commercial bakery. And this, this one's like super basic, right? I look at the balance sheet for the company.

Inventory value is 2 million. I look at the commercial property insurance policy, and it only provides 1 million of coverage for business, personal property and business. Personal property is sort of all encompassing term for inventory, um, furniture, fixtures, equipment, uh, work in progress. Um, machinery equipment.

So, so I know they've only got a million dollars of coverage for what on the balance sheet is 2 million in inventory. And the reason that [00:16:00] matters for you and why it can matter for a search for so much is because in a lot of cases, and I think this was this actually, this was a case here. Um, if you're buying a business from, from say a boomer with respect to the boomers, but thinking about the silver tsunami, right.

And a lot of the businesses that are for sale, a lot of the businesses you see that are for sale are from. Entrepreneurs who started the business 20 or 30 years ago. Most of the, in a lot of cases, they own their real estate outright. They don't have mortgages. They don't have a bank facility. They don't have anyone looking at them and saying, do you have adequate limits of insurance?

Now, if you go by a business with 2 million in inventory and you have any kind of asset back loan or a lender who remotely has it together, the lender is going to say, well, gosh, What are the business assets worth? And are they fully insured? Does that protect the lender? And so for our client buying this, this, this bakery, uh, equipment [00:17:00] distributor, it becomes an immediate Q of E adjustment to, to increase the property limit to what would be an adequate limit of insurance based on the business's assets and exposures.

That's, that's a big one. Um,

**Athena:** can I just summarize the, the, those examples really quick? Andy, did it, you know, just. Lane English, if you go back to that slide, um, so what that means for you all, and in terms of, like, the diligence part of it is, you know, on the ad backs where the seller was paying overpaying by 40%. You don't need to disclose that to the seller because it's just going to be potentially extra money to you when you buy the new policies when you take over the business.

So in some cases you can just find extra money, find extra SDE that you're going to have [00:18:00] with the pro forma adjustments once you take over the business. So it can be upside for you. And then that that lower example of these claims that are going to come and going to hit the policy Then what you would do is, is look at what the cost was going to be to you after you take over the business, taking into account these claims, and then you would have a reduction in the SDE, uh, with the, the, so you would, you would have to retrade potentially if it was a substantially larger amount.

So say your insurance policy was going to increase by 50K or whatever for the year. Then that would warrant you having to go back before you close on the business to Mr. Seller and be like, hey, uh, actually, there's going to be significantly more insurance expenses to us because of these injury claims that are going to hit our policies when we take over the business.

So we need to adjust the purchase price there. Um, and then with the example of the, the, um, [00:19:00] balance sheet, not matching the, um. Uh, the coverage again. That's that's another one of those things that, you know, that's a potential retrade conversation, depending on the amount that it's going to change for you.

And you take over that policy. Did I summarize all that appropriately? Andy, 

**Andy:** that was great. That was, I should, I'll listen to the recording. I'll just say all that next time. I, 

**Athena:** I have, uh, uh, you know, cause you're, you know, this stuff and you're very good at explaining it, but I just like to summarize in English.

So people understand as part of the due diligence process, what that actually means for them. So this is great. Carry on. Cool. 

**Andy:** Yeah. It's sometimes I feel like I'm like, uh, when I go to the doctor. And they tell me what's wrong. And I'm like, one more time, so I can understand it. Uh, and I, I try not to be the doctor.

So, um, so I just use the example of, of, uh, the property [00:20:00] limits, right? But the, the thing, I think the thing to think about insurance diligence and a really, a common thing that happens to me is we'll get a call. For folks who haven't seen this presentation or haven't met Josh Ryan in person, they know that they need to look at insurance as part of their deal.

They know that they need new insurance at close because it's an acetylene transaction. And they'll say, Hey, can you guys help me and get some quotes? And I almost always. Um, when somebody says, Hey, can you get quotes for us? I almost always cringe a little bit on the inside because I think that they aren't necessarily seeing the bigger picture and this is where I get, um, all kinds of poetic and emotional about what we do because I think this insurance solutions is just really interesting, um, crossroads, if you will.

Of legal diligence and accounting diligence and and outside of the diligence that you as a buyer doing across the business. I think insurance diligence looks across [00:21:00] every discipline more so than any other. Individual area of diligence, right? Like the QB folks are typically stuck in the books, which is fine and legal has their own scope for me in an approach to insurance.

Diligence is there's literally no ask every aspect of the business can touch upon insurance. If you think about, you know, your buckets, if you think about setting up a data room or diligence work streams, everyone of those work streams will have some corresponding impact on insurance, which is why I sort of We have this slide how insurance diligence matches business diligence.

Um, the, the inventory and example is was pretty clear. Hopefully, it's clear. Um, there's, there's other aspects to like, deferred CapEx. And the funny thing about this is it can go both ways where, in some cases, insurance companies will require CapEx because the property, um, could border on being uninsurable.

[00:22:00] And that's the kind of cap X. You might not necessarily see on the balance sheet. Um, but the things that we asked for and look at, uh, we asked for insurance company lost control recommendations and risk control letters. And so, A lot of folks don't necessarily know this. Insurance companies, um, can be very proactive in trying to help their clients, their insurance, uh, mitigate risk.

And so if an insurance company is writing property insurance, for example, and it's a building with an older roof or, um, you know, old wiring, insurance companies will come out and inspect the property during the policy period and they'll write a letter or make some recommendations. Um, And those are the things we look at to understand, are there, they're hidden, are there, is there hidden CapEx here that you're buying a building, or maybe you're even leasing a building, but are you, are you assuming some [00:23:00] exposure that otherwise would the seller disclose.

Hey, we got this letter from the insurance company, and they said that we've got to repave the parking lot. And it's funny. I'm actually working on a deal now where that's that's an issue. The insurance company doesn't like the parking lot because it has holes and potholes are, uh, you know, tripping hazard.

And so how would you ever know that if you didn't ask for the insurance companies, you know, loss control letter and recommendations, um. So that's an example of legal diligence. This is a big one contractual compliance. Um, so we, we tend to talk about the blue collar businesses a lot because their insurance seems more obvious and blue collar businesses when you think about.

Worker injury or assets or liability to the general public.

White collar businesses have just as much exposure on contractual compliance and insurance [00:24:00] requirements. And so we look at the client and customer contracts to understand what insurance is required of the target company. Are they purchasing the insurance required? And then from a defensive, do the, does the company's contracts that they use with their clients?

Does that protect the company? Equally, right? So if the company, if the company you're looking at has clients, are those contracts sort of unilaterally in favor of the client or the unilaterally in favor of the company, or is it a balance? And so we look at those things, um, pretty closely the, the, the first example of, um, contractual compliance that falls back into the bucket of potential SDE adjustment.

Um, and one that we see pretty frequently, to be honest, companies can enter into a contract. Okay. Um, people overlook the insurance requirements [00:25:00] over a couple of years, you know, maybe they bought some coverage and now they don't. And so we'll see those kinds of adjustments pretty frequently. Frankly, it's a, it's a common, uh, area of business that people overlook.

And usually, even if you've got legal looking at all the contractual stuff, and you've got somebody doing legal diligence, in most cases, they don't compare that to the company's insurance program. It comes up sometimes, but it's usually stuff we find. Um, actually, I've got a really fun example of this one.

This is, this is a current example, too. And it's a, it's a private equity deal. Consumer products company using a 3PL. So the consumer products company used to have an own warehouse here in the States, and they had last year, they had 7, 000, 000 inventory and 7, inventory coverage. Okay, then they moved to a [00:26:00] 3 PL up in Canada.

So their inventory no longer flows through their warehouse. It flows through the three PL warehouse and they drop their insurance limits by $5 million. And it was a really interesting thing. I, I talked to the CFO and I said, I, I can see, I, I happen to look at your policies year over year, and your insurance premium dropped from $80,000 to $20,000 and the limit dropped from seven to two.

Why is that? And the CFO thought. This is, this is literally happening now. The CFO thinks that the 3PL is providing coverage for his inventory. If there's a fire at the 3PL warehouse, 99 percent of the time, that's not going to be the case because for the 3PL to ensure all the inventory of every customer's.

Assets and inventory. It's in its care custody and control. Um, it would just be astronomically expensive, right? It's no insurance company would want to put out, you know, there could be a billion dollars of inventory in a [00:27:00] warehouse. The 3PL will have something called warehouse keepers legal liability. So if the 3PL drives a forklift into.

A pallet of your of, you know, their customers goods that's covered. But if there's a fire at the warehouse, all the individual customers who use that 3PL have to look to their own insurance policies for for coverage for their lost inventory. And so that's another example of. Legal diligence and back that up, picked it up.

They wouldn't have known to, um, sort of falls through the cracks and grand scheme of things. You know, it's a 60, 000 hour adjustment, but the Q of you guys looking at the insurance year over year, it just sort of blends in and nobody seemed to think, why would we have any question about that? That's what the CFO told us.

Okay. Um, and so that's why that's why I get so yeah. Excited about this stuff where it doesn't happen all the time, but when we find things that matter that nobody else picks up, it's like, All right, we're doing something different here. And, uh, [00:28:00] it's pretty cool. So quality of earnings. This is a really common example, too, that we see all the time and growth companies and what, um What people don't necessarily know is that workers compensation insurance and general liability insurance, which is essentially every business out there should be buying general liability workers compensation insurance, um, most of those policies have adjustable premiums and the premium is adjustable after the policy period based on the actual revenue or payroll.

incurred during the policy period. So what happens is the policies expire. The insurance company conducts an audit. They ask the insured for their financials and the insurance company will review the financials against the estimated payrolls or revenues. When the policy started, the insurance company will true up the premium and they'll send you a bill.[00:29:00] 

And sometimes it's not a bill. Sometimes they send a check, but more often than not, it's It's a bill. Um, it's, it's a good thing because if you, if you get an invoice for additional insurance premiums, it means your business grew, but some folks will use this audit mechanism as a type of financing mechanism.

And if you think about it, there's really not a charge from the insurance company. They don't. They don't add it like a interest charge for, Oh, you underestimated your payrolls. You underestimate your revenue. You should have paid us an extra 10, 000 when the policy started. They just send the bill. But what happens from a QE perspective is most businesses just.

When they get the audit premium, they just pay it cash and it falls in the next financial period. And so one of the things that we look at is to try to tie out the general ledger and the actual insurance expense to the insurance policies, because what this has an effect of doing is understating earnings.

And if you think about it, if you [00:30:00] get a bill for an insurance policy and you pay it after the policy expired from an accounting perspective, you should have expensed it when the policy was in force. Um, and so that's that's another sort of common thing we run into and try to true it up. 

**Athena:** Can I try to put that in?

So what that means. Is let's say your policy in 2024 was based on, say, 1, 000, 000 in revenue, but actually in 2024, you did 2, 000, 000 in revenue. So you won't get the bill until 2025 for a policy. That would cover 2 million in revenue. So it can be retroactive and they can bill you after the fact. So it's not like, Oh, we didn't know that was going to happen.

You just pay whatever in 2024 that you thought the insurance company can and will. Look at your earnings for the previous year. So again, a gotcha here that if they were [00:31:00] underinsured and had a banner year, then the policy is, it is going to go up, but that's not going to hit the P and L, because it's not going to be paid until the following year.

**Andy:** Exactly 

**Athena:** cool. Exactly. 

**Andy:** And there's 1 thing, um, not that what you said was wrong, but it's a thing that, uh, the concept that I want to. Just kind of try to highlight the limits of insurance just, just because the company said that we have a million dollars of sales with them. They had to, they have the same amount of insurance, like fundamentally the limits of liability are the same.

So it's not that they're underinsured necessarily. It's that they're undercharged or they underpaid and the adjustment happens after the policy. That's a 

**Athena:** good distinction. So they'll cover them regardless of what the revenue is. It's not like they won't cover them up to 2 million. It's just that they're going to have to pay for it after the fact.

**Andy:** Yes, exactly. Exactly. And that's that's that's 1 of those [00:32:00] things that it's I take it for granted that that makes sense to me. But everybody else has the same thing. We have enough insurance. Um, those 2 issues of was the premium correct. Is different than do you have enough insurance? 

**Athena:** Yeah, I gotcha. So you've got enough insurance.

You just might be billed for it later than what you thought you were going to, or you might end up paying more money for the coverage that you were that was required that year that you had, you just didn't pay in full for it because you. Right. Had a lot more, uh, earnings than, than you originally anticipated.

**Andy:** Yep. And then it gets into this whole wonky issue of if it's an asset only deal, who pays the bill? And is it captured in your working capital tag? Y'all have all kinds of fun with that. Um, I'm going to skip over the last two, but you guys can kind of figure it out. So I talk [00:33:00] quickly about what it is that we do at an engagement and what does that actually look like?

Um, so we tend to get engaged after I usually I like to get engaged. Um, honestly, as soon after as we can be. So we kind of know. 1, what we have our pipeline and 2, um, even though most folks want to get done before they really go full steam ahead with legal and insurance. Um, if if you are looking at a business that is particularly risky, um, either.

You know, in an insurance speak, we'd say a tough exposure, right? So something that's difficult to ensure, um, heavy trucker, right? Trucking, maybe trucking or roofing, um, it's helpful, I think, if we get engaged early, so we can kind of tell you, 

**Anke:** Hey, 

**Andy:** here's a couple of conversations you're going to, you will want to have with the seller early on to understand if [00:34:00] you're going to find problems with the insurance later.

It's, it's things like, um, See down here, we've got X mod forecasting. Um, you'll hear the term X mod or experience rating or experience modification rating. Or experience rating factor, those are all synonymous for the same thing, which is, is basically it's an index that is assigned to a company based on workers compensation claims.

And you can very quickly get a read from a company, and this is this is particularly true for for blue collar businesses. If you ask them, Hey, what's your X amount. And companies that have good safety records have fewer claims and their X model will be lower. Uh, and because it's an index, the number is pegged at 1.

so an X model of 1 is perfectly average. Anything lower than 1 is good. Anything above 1 is less good. Anything over one and a half, if the X mod is 1. 75, [00:35:00] even though you might just be starting QAV, that should be a red flag to call us to kind of dig into their claims and understand what's going on and why does the loss history look that way.

The X mod has a direct impact on the cost of insurance. Um, it's literally it's part of the function for the premium. It's payroll times rate times x mod. Uh, so there's an immediate cost impact, but it can also be a, um, an issue for the ability for the company's ability to get new work. And so some in some industries, uh, service industries in particular, um.

Large organizations, blue chip customers will have, uh, basically X mod ceilings for subcontractors. They might hire. So if you're, if you're looking at a business that wants to do work for a municipality or general contractor, um, power authority, um, you know, utility contractors, things of [00:36:00] that nature, like they won't hire.

They won't hire subcontractors that have mods over 1. 3, 1. 5. And in some cases for power utilities, anything over 1. 0, uh, can be really tough to get work to. So, I use that more as an example of when to call us early, XMOD, and tougher industries. So, I typically get engaged around LOI. Um, typically don't go full steam ahead until QAV is done, but we like to jump in if you have a data room, we like to look across the entire data room for all the reasons I said earlier about how we kind of mirror the business diligence.

And then we compile all our findings. Usually there's a little bit of back and forth with the seller. We're, we're going to ask for some insurance specific information that probably hadn't been requested. And then, uh, usually in 5 to 10 days, we compile our findings in an acquisition insurance report, which is kind of similar to a QA report or a legal report.

And [00:37:00] we start starting up at the top. The 1st thing we've got to understand is the deal. And I think I mentioned this earlier asset transaction. You can assume that you're going to need new insurance policies at close. Um, In a stock transaction, or I've got units here because if it's an LLC, you're going to buy membership interest units or equity units, um, in a stock transaction, even though you would think the insurance policies are transferable, there are a number of insurance companies that from a, uh, just their business practice.

Is to cancel and rewrite insurance policies is they find out there's a change of control or a change of ownership. It's not in the policy doesn't say any like the Hartford's a great example. If you look at a general liability policy from the Hartford, it says absolutely nothing about change of control, but Hartford Just requires it.

And I wouldn't bring this up if I hadn't been on the wrong end of it at some point where I think this was 12 or 13 years ago. [00:38:00] Stock deal. Hartford policies can survive the transaction. Those things will come up if you go to, um, go to close the deal. You have to add a lender to your policy and say you kept the policies in place with the seller's insurance broker.

They'll find out right before you close Oh, you're selling the company. Oh, gosh. We told the Hartford because we wanted to. Endorse the policy to ensure that covered the new lender. And now they're telling us that we have to rewrite the policy and that can impact the cost of the policy. So we'll change the premiums.

Um, and it can actually, and we can delay the deal to frankly. So start with that understanding. What do we anticipate? Then we look at coverage gaps. So when I think coverage gaps, I think, um, either missing policies where they're, they're absolutely, you know, should be a type of insurance that would be, um, reasonable and customary for that business, or sometimes the business will have reasonable and customary [00:39:00] policies, but those policies will have exclusions that are, um What I was what I would say is basically unacceptable and it's surprising how often you see that.

But, um, we, I did, I worked on a company years ago that was, um, dog chews that they imported from, uh, Tibet. Uh, it's probably long enough. I could think of the names. Himalayan dog chew, I think was what it's called. And they made these yak milk. Dog chews. I don't know if anybody, you could buy a PetSmart made out of yak milk from Tibet.

It's kind of interesting. So I look at their products liability policy and on the very last page, there was a imported goods exclusion. That's I don't know. Joe can't see that, but I'm doing this. Like, who would have thought imported goods? Everything's important. Basically nullifies the usefulness of that particular policy that's covered.

Yeah, I'm trying to be mindful of time impact on valuation. Everything that [00:40:00] we talked about. Hey, is there a contractual issue? Is there a property insurance issue where the payrolls reported low and we're going to expect an audit premium? We break it down into here's the current premium. We see on the policies.

Here's what it should be based on X, Y, Z factors of contractual compliance. On adjustments, um, asset values, et cetera, and, and there's that, that's a different conversation than we recommend you buy more umbrella insurance because you'll sleep at night better, right? So there's, there's really two parts of that.

You can't, in my opinion, you can't make an argument for a SDE adjustment based on your comfort and risk tolerance, but you can make an argument for SDE value adjustment based on contractual compliance, limits of insurance relative to asset values, that kind of stuff. Um, projected cost analysis contemplates if we had to go get new policies, what will that cost?

What does it cost them to build a business correctly [00:41:00] for all the aforementioned issues? I mentioned the claims analysis, um, commercial insurance underwriters look at 5 years of loss history for all lines of coverage every time you go to renew the policies. So that's what we look at. It's, it's really important to note to that, that loss history.

It's kind of like a balance sheet. If there are open liability claims. the value of those claims can change over time. So say there was a worker's comp claim that's two years old, that claim might not close for three or four years. The, or the employee could get rear injured and the insurer would reopen the claim.

And so you have these historical claims and you look at them every year and then might actually go up over time. Um, risk control, the stuff I mentioned about basically, does it, does the company have their arms around? Their risks and their ability to mitigate the possibility of claims and losses against policies, transactional impact, um, sort of same with the deal [00:42:00] structure.

Some policies obviously have change of control provisions. So we address those. And then, of course, the contractual compliance.

This is my last slide top questions to ask during diligence. And, you know, I've probably put myself out of a job here. Uh, because you could certainly look at these yourself. Um, we just happen to do it for you. And as Athena asked me, I think Athena asked me, we don't charge for diligence. We look to become the insurance broker at close.

And that's, that's how we're compensated. But these are the things we look at materiality exclusions, um, classification and rating basis of the policies to make sure the premiums are appropriate and correct, particularly silver tsunami stuff. People bought insurance 20 years ago, it goes automatic renewal every year.

No one's looked at it or policies can be grandfathered in and insurance companies no longer have an appetite for that class of [00:43:00] business. Um, if you've got grandfathered policies, you can expect to change it in the premium. Um, and sometimes it's the flip side. People renew policies every year, and they never look at it, and then they're overpaying, you know, 20, 30%.

Um, and honestly, that just happened this month. We looked at a stone fabricator. Uh, we, well, we wrote it, we wrote the new insurance, but we took this company's Core package policy from 25, 000 to 16, 000. Well, increasing the limits of insurance, and it was presumably because no one marketed it, which is the insurance terminology for getting quotes and marketing insurance, um, assignment of policies, tail coverage compliance.

Lost the screen. Oh, this is last thing here. Huge. Everybody runs into this. Not everybody, but a lot of people sellers on the building, you're going to buy the operating business, but not the real estate asset. You're going to enter into a new 10 year lease because that's what the SBA is going [00:44:00] to require who's going to cover the building at close.

And then this is the really tricky part to for liability purposes. The seller, say the seller creates a new entity to own the real estate, and the seller is now the landlord leasing the real estate to the operating business, the seller should have their own liability insurance. So if the seller neglects to do things like fix the potholes in the parking lot, and someone gets hurt, you want to be able to sue the seller, and you want the seller to have insurance coverage, you don't want the seller to rely on your liability insurance, you don't want your liability insurance to cover the seller for their new obligations as your landlord.

It's a different relationship when the when the seller was the both the operating business and the real estate owner.

I think that's right. That's it. That's that's what I got. Um, 

**Athena:** really like good stuff and so much for us to. [00:45:00] Think about, you know, like, all the things we don't think about, right? Because as as a buyer of a business, we're really like, what's the transition going to look like? Are the financials actually what they should be?

You know, it's like insurance is not the thing that. You like, you want it there, but you don't necessarily need to learn it in detail. So you kind of glazed over the, like, amazing part about what you do is there's no cost to, um, buyers to, to have you look at this and do diligence on on the insurance. So there's absolutely no reason why you shouldn't be engaging with Andy and Josh as part of your diligence process to look at your policies and, you know.

Like, full transparency, you'll probably love working with them. So much. You will also want them to make sure that they are the ones looking at your coverage and you buy your coverage through them because you're going to need coverage as a new [00:46:00] person. But there's no cost or obligation for you to do the diligence process with them.

And they're going to be looking at those things and catching those things. And I don't know if you saw Andy. Light up about how excited he got about finding things that nobody else saw during the diligence process. I think you want someone that passionate about insurance, like during this process, cause you know, we don't think about it, we buy it, whatever, but when you need it, oh my gosh, you're going to want to make sure that it's in a good place.

And you're also not going to want to be in the situation where. Okay, it's closed. We're now setting everything up and like, oh, my God, you have, you know, several tens of thousands of dollars more in coverage or bills that come after the fact that you weren't anticipating as a new owner. It's not a position that you want to find yourself in.

So, um, really important to. No, like, okay, I don't need to understand deeply exactly how the policies work, but I need someone that does to look at this and make sure I'm in a good place. And I'm protected [00:47:00] 

**Andy:** and honestly, I didn't say that here. But 1 of the things that we try to do to the diligence process, um, we know that most of our clients haven't been responsible for buying commercial insurance before.

And so educating around, I mean, this, this presentation is geared to why do diligence when we find one's a matter, the sort of the second part of it is to how we lay out our diligence reports are, what are the exact coverages that this business has? What does that mean? What does it do for you? What should they have?

Um, and so I really look at it like it's a lot of, it's a different. Interaction and a lot of holding handholding for me, which I like doing. It's, it's, you know, different than an insurance broker who's used to working with a commercial risk manager or a CFO, we get it. You're going to see for the first time.

And that wasn't what you did before you bought this company. So, 

**Athena:** well, even even for. Me, right? Like I, all of my business experience has been out of the country. So a lot of the [00:48:00] things I was learning for the first time again, so as a business owner in the U S I'm like, I know I need a lot more insurance than I probably did in the UK because everyone's here.

So. I worked with these guys and they were excellent at explaining everything to me, getting me a really great policy at a very reasonable price. So, um, you know, they're not paying me to say this. I just had a really good experience with them. And I also appreciate the service that they're offering that.

You don't realize like how important it's going to be. Um, I have a few questions that I'd like to dig into different topics that you touched on if that's cool with you. Absolutely. Um, so is there like a difference between like, let's say the, the, the policies are assignable versus, you know, an asset sale.

Um, correct me if I'm wrong, but as a new entity, You know, if you're doing an asset sale, the insurance or a new owner, the insurance company might assign more risk to you because you haven't been running the [00:49:00] business, you could be looking at a larger policy, which is you get another reason to find out those costs before you close or before you get in the driver's seat.

Um, is that something you see people get caught out about a lot or are there other things that, you know, you just see people like not realize is going to be a big issue. 

**Andy:** Yeah, that definitely. In Texas, for example, um, Texas Mutual is the workers, the big workers compensation. Sure, in the state, I think they're at half the work count policies in the state.

Um, Texas Mutual provides a dividend credit. So, if you buy your workers compensation insurance from Texas Mutual, say it costs 10, 000, after a couple of years, they start giving back. I've seen the dividend credit as much as 50%. So just on the one side of it, um, sort of bigger end. We've got a client that the worker's compensation premium was 130, [00:50:00] 000 and the dividend every year was 65, 000.

And had they done an asset sale, they would have lost the dividend credit because that, that, that dividend credit is grandfathered in based on how long the company's been with Texas Mutual. Um, the, the idea of, you know, Being grandfathered into good rates or being that you're a new owner, and is there more risk because you're a new owner?

That's yeah, and honestly, I'm giving away all the trade secrets here. But part of what we do is to tell underwriters that the solar staying on in a consulting role, um, to the extent that we can play up the. Buyers experience to say this is a person with the X, Y, Z background and a lot of cases last get actually we're, um, gosh, what I'm trying to remember the deal.

It was, uh, it was something that I thought was really a name and the insurance company wanted to know the buyer specific experience running, um, might have [00:51:00] been home health care. And it was the insurance company. It was a hard note. We won't provide this coverage if this person hadn't run a home health care business before.

Um, I'd say it's not the rule. Uh, it's probably 10 to 20 percent of the time. We see that kind of kind of thing, but it's, um, 

**Athena:** but even more important to have. like you that understand the acquisition and transition process and like searchers deeply right? Because insurance folks might not, they might have no experience on ETA and the transition and that sort of thing.

So having someone in your corner that knows. The way to have those conversations. So you're covered appropriately, but also not overpaying or not in a situation where you're overpaying. Um, it sounds like to having you look at it early on like that, like, if you were considering an asset sale, but it was going to be a 65, 000 dollar.

Less of S. D. E. And if you're only dealing [00:52:00] with two, three hundred S. D. E. For example, it's, it's such a significant amount. You might actually want to switch to a stock sale at that point. Just, just to get that savings, depending on, on how little fat there is left on the bones. So, um, that's a really interesting.

Uh, thing there. I see Luke has a question. So I might call on him in a second. I just did. Um, So you guys work SBA deals and SBA has requirements for insurance, right? So do you know, um, or can you just speak to that really quickly? Like when you're buying a business, the SBA might require more insurance than what was already on the business before.

**Andy:** Yeah. Um, so a couple things there. I didn't touch on it here, but key man life insurance is, is usually recorded by SBA lenders. And that's something that facilitate to life insurance on the person who's guaranteeing the loan. But on the commercial side. Um, what I see [00:53:00] pretty commonly, so general liability insurance, which is the sort of all encompassing third party liability to insurance that most businesses buy that customer really has a million dollar liability limit, like 90 percent of the general liability policies out there just have a million dollar liability limit off the shelf.

And that is going to meet the SBA requirements where you don't see that as an auto liability. Um, if, if, you know, from buying personal auto insurance, most states have a state minimum requirement, and it can be really low, like 25 per person, 50, 000 per accident. Um, and so I've definitely seen a lot of services businesses that don't buy a million dollars of auto liability insurance, and that does not work for SBA.

**Anke:** So 

**Andy:** that's a big issue. Um, and then the property value issue. And then the other thing, too, is to get not to stay on Texas too much, but. [00:54:00] Texas is like our number two state and where our clients are domiciled. It's a big ETA state. Um, Texas has a lot of wind exposure. And so what I've seen in insurance.

Insurance goes in market cycles, so sometimes you can get more insurance for less. Insurance companies pay a lot of claims, they raise premiums, they offer less coverage, um, and that's kind of important to know. To gauge what's going to happen when your policies are new every year. And so when you see the stuff in the news about wildfires, catastrophic losses, a hundred billion dollars, it's industry that has a wider impact than you might expect.

And even though you're not in California, it can hit your business. And so what we see, what we see in Texas is that, um, a lot of those seller owned, uh, the seller. Real estate is underinsured from an S. P. A. perspective where it's it's things like the by property insurance, but they'll have a roof exclusion, [00:55:00] um, or the by property insurance.

But there's a co insurance penalty, which makes the insurance much less useful in the event of a claim. So it definitely. In my mind, one of the, like, heuristics, I guess, that I use is, if this is a business that I see already has a commercial lender attached to it, I feel like a little bit better that it's going to be less messed up than if it's a business that doesn't have any debt today, right?

Pre closed. Much less likely anybody's looked at the insurance. So. 

**Athena:** Right. And then if the seller is transitioning to being a landlord and is underinsured and then SBA is like, we need a 10 year lease. We need to make sure that they're properly insured, et cetera, et cetera. You're finding this out too late in your diligence process.

And that, that can end up being deal breakers or things that probably should just be touched upon earlier as part of that like chest checklist of like, here's all the deal adjustments that came up during our [00:56:00] diligence, legal. QV insurance, right? So then we can have that list. We can go and sit down. Okay, Mr.

Seller, here's all the adjustments that we need as opposed to right, you know, at the closing date. And it's like, Oh, SBA needs a bunch of insurance. And the seller's like, I don't want to get all that insurance, you know, but if we had that conversation earlier, it might make it less contentious at that point.

So timing of these conversations and, and, and revealing these sorts of things is really important too. 

**Andy:** Yeah, no, I couldn't agree more. There's um, we can flag all this stuff. I kind of understand that these conversations have to have to happen in context, you know, and it's a lot harder for a buyer of a business to have a conversation, but you know, it's It's until you've been there.

It's, you know, I try to be very mindful. The person selling the business has a day job, you know, which is to run the business 

and 

**Andy:** then you pull the stuff on [00:57:00] top of them to see seller deal fatigue is like it's an issue and we don't want to add to that. Right. That's trying to make it easier for everybody.

**Athena:** Yeah, and even more important, you understand that process as opposed to just going to some random commercial insurance broker that has no idea what, what that is looking like before you get to the point of being an owner of that business. Um, I wanted to ask about the XMOD really quickly. Like, is that something that you see or you would recommend that people do a little pre diligence on before they get into LOI?

Is it, is it, is it an easy, easy thing to rattle off? Like, Hey, what's your XMOD number? Is that something that brokers will hold back? Or, you know, cause one of the things we we've had Barlow Williams here. We've had Chris, you know, talking about QV and like, what's some pre diligence that you could do potentially.

And it sounds like the XMOD number might be one. You can find out before you get too far down the track. 

**Andy:** If it's a blue collar services business, and you ask the seller, [00:58:00] what's the, or the banker, here's the thing. If it's a good X mod, they usually tell you if it's below one, they're like, frequently in the, in the, The SIM or whatever the deck is right for the business.

Um, you know, there's that paragraph like employees and safety. And again, this is for blue collar businesses, right? Like the white collar stuff. It doesn't matter as much people sit at a desk or sales people. Big deal. Um, and I'm going to say something, maybe it's obvious, but the cost of workers compensation insurance is more for people who are more likely to get injured.

There's different codes for every type of work. And for, um, generally salespeople and clerical office employees, it's I don't see negligible, but it's pretty low. It's a difference between like a 25 cent rate and a couple of bucks per 100 of payroll. So that's that's the measurement is is per 100 of payroll.

But, um, If it's a blue collar [00:59:00] business and the seller doesn't know the XMOD, that, it's surprising. Most people do. Most people know exactly what it is, um, if, if it matters, and they should. So, and yes, you could, you should ask early, uh, because it's a red flag. If it's, if it's a big number, um, and the, the one other thing to keep in mind about the XMOD, the way it's calculated, it's, so it's, it's calculated by an In most states in like 34 states, it's calculated by a national rating agency that gets the data directly from insurance companies.

And the way it's calculated is that it drops the most recent policy period. So say today is January 30th, 2025 and say the company's policies for new in January one, the X mod that's in force today doesn't include the losses from 2024. It's in the reason for that is because they're too, the [01:00:00] terminology is green.

They're not sure. Um, somebody could have gotten hurt in December and there's going to be medical bills for another 10 months. So from a rating perspective, the rating agency just throws out the most recent year. And what that means is you could buy the company and even an asset. And this is an important point too, is that.

Even an asset transaction, 

**Anke:** you 

**Andy:** really cannot or you should not be able to, but you can't outrun the loss experience. And the rating agencies have even an asset deal paperwork that you have to fill out. And they look at the loss history of the old co versus new co, and they want to know who bought the business.

And Basically, they'll come up with a new experience rating for the new co, uh, based on the old coast loss history. So that's a common question. Hey, if we do an asset deal, does this loss experience matter? Nine times out of 10, it does occasionally, you know, if you want to be unethical about it, people figure out how to bury your stuff.

Um, I don't do that. But I've seen [01:01:00] other people do it. And that's that's a whole other diligence issue by itself. 

**Athena:** Yeah, well, that can come back to bite you, right? If the if it gets uncovered by the insurance company, like that, then it could completely invalidate the policies and cause all sorts of problems.

So 

yeah, 

**Athena:** intentionally hiding things like that. So x mod number is important, something you should try to get as early. As possible to give you an indication of those are going to be substantially more cost, but equally, and we've talked about this before, like, if the owner is running a business that has a high X mod, there's going to be a substantial amount of things that you need to do to go in to clean that up.

And it can be a couple of years before you're able to drop that because, like you said, if it's 2025. The X mod is based on basically what happened in 2023. So if there's a bunch of stuff that happened in 2024, that that can make it even worse. 

**Andy:** Exactly. And that's where I was going with that is you could be looking at a 1.

0 X mod [01:02:00] today, but say there was a couple of claims six months ago. We'll look at that and say, all right, directionally next year, your X mod is going to go from 1. 0 to 1. 5. That's just another tool to sort of forecast to know what to expect. 

**Athena:** Right, which could if you are doing municipal work or commercial work of any sort could impact your ability to generate the same amount of revenue in the future, because you're not going to be able to get those kinds of.

So this is this is serious. It's important, especially for anyone that does any sort of blue collar stuff. So I know Joe's on the road, but he's looking at HVAC business right now. So, you know, there's people that can get injured in the line of work on HVAC and important to look at those sorts of things.

Um, something you didn't touch on, but, you know, we talk about a lot and, and you were, you and I were just at the same event and I was, I was kind of digging in on the lawyers about reps and warranties. Right? And like, what we can do to, to [01:03:00] try to protect or call back. So, I noticed that it was, there was a mention of reps and warranties in your slide is, are you able to get insurance as part of your purchase?

So, like, cover if, if the seller. Like if there was some fraud or they misrepresented something and you've paid them the whole money of the purchase price at close and, you know, there's, there's nothing set aside. Like, does insurance cover for that at all? Or what was the reps and warranties point in there?

**Andy:** Yeah, so it's, it's a couple of things. Um, given the opportunity, I dork out and read your purchase agreement and look at the insurance rep. And there's, there's a couple of things over the years that I've found are really can be meaningful. Like. Um, the insurance program meets all contractual statutory requirements, uh, of the company.

Um, but more specifically around reps and warranties insurance, um, that, that is a type of insurance product is an insurance policy that literally covers the reps [01:04:00] and warranties the seller makes in the policy or makes in the purchase agreement rather. And the reps and warranties policy can take the place of a seller indemnity or a seller escrow indemnity.

Um, traditionally, that's been reserved for deals over 20 or 25 million in enterprise value. But it's funny, there's actually a, uh, a London insurer, uh, I think it's CFC, um, who I coincidentally have a call with in two weeks, because I posted something on LinkedIn last week about this, and everybody jumped on me.

They, they introduced the product, but Two, three years ago, it's a sell side reps and warranties policy, and I've been building feelings about it. Um, the reason I have a bit of feelings about it is because the sell side policy doesn't cover seller fraud. If it's a policy that covers fraud and literally just in like the last couple of months, they introduced the buy side policy that includes coverage for seller fraud.

So it doesn't, it doesn't [01:05:00] make sense for every deal. Um, the cost is, uh, usually the cheapest, I think I want to say is around 40, 000 bucks. It might be able to drop a little bit below that, but. For a 4 or 5 million enterprise value deal, if you have concerns, the really, what's most useful for probably is facilitating the transaction where if you have a seller who is saying, Nope, I want my, you know, I want my millions and I'm gone.

I'm off to, you know, Cuba. Or wherever sellers go with their money and they want to walk away from the deal represent warranties. Insurance is really good for for that. So you can basically the seller can have a totally clean exit use the buyer know that you've got some recourse for breaches of reps and warranties and there's an insurance policy there.

**Athena:** Interesting. So when, when you see people, have you, have they used it on the small business side? And do you see people negotiate the purchase price down a little bit to cover that? So, okay, Mr. seller, you [01:06:00] want completely out and you want to, you don't want to, you don't want to put any money in escrow. You don't want to do, uh, you know, equity injection and hold a note on full standby.

Uh, I'll reduce the purchase price by 40 grand and get this. Insurance. Like, do you see people doing that? Are they using it that way? 

**Andy:** So, candidly, I don't see it a ton in the deals that we work on. Um, the, this, this, the small business reps and warranties policy, I could go off on it. I could talk about reps for an hour.

It's not as common as you'd think. Um, I think it will become more common for a couple different reasons, but one of the issues is the underwriting. And so most of the reps and warranties insurance market for, for middle market deals, you know, 50 million enterprise and value above, um, the reps and insurers underwrite the commercial diligence that the buyer is doing.

And I have the commercial diligence and the Q of [01:07:00] E and legal diligence, right? They're underwriting based on all these diligence reports and on. The types of deals we work on the level of diligence typically isn't there. So there's really only this really the one insurer that's offering products and I think they call it TLP and section liability protector.

I think, um, is that policy off the shelf and originally didn't cover. The actual purchase agreement that covered a basket of seller reps written that the insurance company would agree to. Um, I believe they're changing that. So it's hopefully we'll have a better application. But, um, that is the way you described it is how it works in the mill market.

Right. And if you think about it, if you think about the insurance policies, uh, capital versus literally the capital that somebody to keep them in escrow, it can [01:08:00] frequently be less expensive if it's, you know, if it's 40, 000 for 2 million of insurance for 2 or 3 years, think of it as a cost of capital consideration versus.

you know, what would you do if you had your cash? Well, you could, if you could keep the cash and buy the policy, most sellers would rather do that. Um, so it used to be that people would actually offer more money for a deal with less escrow, knowing that they're going to buy an insurance policy.

**Athena:** Interesting. Well, Keep us updated on how that develops. It's a, you know, I imagine this is, this is going to be rapidly changing considering the popularity of buying businesses for individuals and, you know, small business ETA. Now, it's so popular. That sounds like there's going to be a good demand and a good reason to have those types of policies for the smaller businesses.

So, um, if, if you get any updates on that, we'll make sure we, we tell everyone. Here too. [01:09:00] I'm I'm a total nerd and I'm like, this is exciting. If there's policies like that, because I'm, I'm constantly thinking about this is what we're talking about with, you know, clients to is like, how do you de risk the transition?

For yourself with with the owner, and I was speaking to, you know, client who had a transition who, like, everything was negotiated up front, but the seller still doesn't understand kind of what they agreed to. Right? So it's like, there's, there's all sorts of things that can come up even after the purchase agreement is done.

So having having peace of mind, especially rest of warranties. That sounds pretty cool. If there's something like that, that yeah. That would come up. Um, Luke, I'm sorry. I saw your hand up and then I went down. Did you have a question for Andy? 

**Luke:** Yeah, I'd love to ask Andy something. First of all, thanks for that great presentation.

It was awesome. And I really love how you kind of teach by using real life deal examples because I know I learned a lot from examples. So I wanted to bring up a [01:10:00] deal example as well and get your expert opinion on Andy. So there's a gas station, but there was a spill at one of the pumps. So the oil leaked out into the soil and contaminated the soil.

But it's being covered by insurance and they're testing the soil. The soil samples are improving. So what are your thoughts on what a potential buyer should be thinking or concerned about if moving forward on this deal with that oil spill into the soil? And again, covered by insurance is what the broker says.

**Andy:** It's so I'd have some questions about covered by insurance. If it's, um, you know, it's kind of interesting. Most there's a law about underground storage tanks and having insurance coverage just for underground storage tanks, which is relatively inexpensive. But, um, site pollution liability insurance or environmental liability insurance, you're here to use kind of synonymously could will be covering remediation and testing costs.

So, I tend to look at Environmental [01:11:00] issues. Um, I tend to look at them pretty transactionally, to be honest, and just I know most people here like, oh, there's this like contamination and you get emotional about it. And I've just I've done enough work on with environmental remediation and sort of brownfield exposures that the insurance approaches.

Let's look at the basically three stages of environmental diligence, right? Like a desktop review of phase one of phase two. And the funny thing about insurance is There's there's a saying you can't ensure a burning building. That's kind of also true with everything else. And you think about environmental remediation and what's funny is that you can cover known contaminant.

You can cover known contamination in some cases, but if it's something where, you know, the EPA has already sent a letter and you know, you're going to have these cleanup costs, you can't ensure that. So what I would say to a buyer is Let's do the insurance diligence around like [01:12:00] what I would add. If I were engaged, what I would ask for is copies that corresponds with the insurance company copies of the policies that are applicable.

Generally corresponds with with the regulatory bodies that are requiring a cleanup. And then usually we'll work with environmental consultants to kind of understand if you hire like a ramble or someone who's an environmental diligence firm, we'll work with them and kind of as an intermediary between us and environmental insurance markets are really, um, Useful is the right way.

I'd say it environmental insurance underwriters are typically also environmental scientists. Like, they know their stuff and the feedback you can get from the diligence process by working with us or another insurance broker who knows environmental insurance is it's can be really, really helpful to quantify.

The exposure and you'll basically be able to find out. Okay. If you're able to quantify the exposure and what the cleanup is going to cost, [01:13:00] maybe you don't buy insurance. If you can't, then we can tell you what insurance would cost. So at least you can box in the exposure. 

**Luke:** Okay. Great. Thanks for that. 

**Athena:** So, in that it's a great example to bring up Luke, and in that example, I mean, typically what we tell folks for the diligence process is like, 1st, see if you can get lending, then do your QB.

Then do legal and then, you know, ideally, they've talked to you at some point and you can say at what points you'd want to feed into that. But for something like that, it might be worth kind of engaging you and doing an environmental. You know, deep dive first, right? To see, like, is this even, is this even something that, like, is, is, is the risk so high that it doesn't make sense to engage everybody else at this point?

Because we're not going to be able to ensure it or they weren't properly insured. Or there's really big issues there with this thing. Am I thinking about the, the, the re sequencing appropriately [01:14:00] in a situation like that? 

**Andy:** Yeah, no, I think that's fun. And. Okay. The other thing for sort of niche industries or exposures like that.

Um, and it's funny because we don't, we don't see a ton. I don't know, searchers maybe have a, uh, distaste for like environmental liability. We don't, we don't see it the whole lot of it, although I'm working on a Service station role right now. And it's funny because it is like literally the parenthetical can of worms.

Like if you do a phase one and the, you know, the phase one review says, okay, this site used to have whatever kinds of industrial exposures. We recommend a phase two core sample, and you know the phase one is going to lead to a phase two and then they're going to find out, okay, you know, contaminated soil.

But the short answer is, yeah, if you know there's going to be issues. It's, it's the same as a worker's comp, blue collar business, environmental, if it's a dirty business on a brownfield or it's something where there's basically if there's [01:15:00] any sort of chemicals or solvents that are used in the industrial processes or like cleaners, manufacturers, um, things of that nature, that's another one where usually if we look early and in the diligence process, it's much easier to box in the risk, figure out what's the right approach and, uh, And address it, but I don't think it should be a deal killer, you know, I got it really.

Whether or not you can get comfortable with the environmental risk, it's like anything you can transfer it. You can transfer it or you can quantify it or push it back to the seller. You can still you can still do the deal. That's it's it's solvable issue. 

**Luke:** That's great to hear. Yeah, there's always the way.

**Andy:** Yeah, usually 

**Athena:** good question. Luke. Awesome. This was, uh. I think fascinating, like, every time I have a [01:16:00] conversation with you, I learn more new stuff. And also just yet another demonstration of how. The creative you can get with with deals, like, looking at them in different ways and different ways of analyzing risk and also upside to you.

Also, Joe, I don't know if I just saw you on meeting. Did you have specific questions? Because I know you're getting close to this process. 

**Joe:** Yeah, thanks, Athena. Yeah, I've been listening the whole time. Quick question. Did I hear correctly that as payroll goes up or revenues go up, your insurance in general has to go up?

**Andy:** Yes, usually. And it depends a little bit on the type of business. But as a general rule of thumb, that's something and people don't really honestly, we get this all the time. Hey, how come my business is growing? How come my insurance costs are going up? Shouldn't I get savings because I'm bigger now? I've got economies of scale.

And so you have to [01:17:00] disconnect these two things. The basic formula for insurance premium is rate times exposure equals premium. And so the exposure can be going up, but the rate can be going down. And the premium will still go up and see, you kind of have to look at every variable. 

**Joe:** Okay. Um, I specifically bring that up cause and making sure I heard that, right?

Yeah. That's almost a slight punishment for doing well. Maybe I can understand the word, the key word is exposure. Like you said. Um, I'm in a scenario where the insurance numbers aren't that huge, but percentage wise, a very large jump from 23 to 24, um, rough numbers real quick, 6, 000 reported on a P& L for 23, 6, 000 and over 16, 000 for 24.

So percentage wise, I mean, what is that like? I mean, nearly more than doubled, uh, tripled almost right from the 6, 000. Their payroll went up a bit, but they never hired more people. So [01:18:00] again, back to the question. Yeah, I know. Right. So the question is, do insurance companies, their underwriters, they only look at.

The payroll figure or the number of employees both. 

**Andy:** So the number of employees for workers compensation insurance doesn't. Yeah. It's going to be the. Oh, 

**Joe:** really? 

**Andy:** Yeah. It's okay. It's the total payroll and it's by type of work performed too. So when you really get granular with the stuff, like if you, if you doubled your sales payroll, Labor payroll, say the same, it's not going to have as big of an impact as if your sales force did the same size, but the people doing the work, you know, triple that's going to, um, there's, there are a couple of things and honestly, on this like size deal, what can even happen is that when the company buys insurance and it's a 6, 000 policy, it's a small, it can be a small enough company where [01:19:00] the, like literally the insurance procurement process is, you know, the broker sitting behind a desk.

Okay. Just work on a computer, putting stuff into the keyboard and quoting a policy online. Nobody looks at it. Nobody has any questions. You go to renew the thing and the revenue goes from 800, 000 to 1. 5 million. Suddenly the insurance companies actually look at what they're writing and you jump out of whatever rate class the business was in into something that's actually appropriate.

And I know it makes no sense. But like, when the policies are real small insurance companies don't even care about the writing when the company gets a little bigger, they're like, all right, maybe we should underwrite this and you'll see this sort of inverse economies of scale that happens. Okay, 

**Joe:** yeah, and maybe that's that explains it is kind of a right sizing.

Maybe they were getting dial and insurance policy a couple of years ago, then they got right sized because of, I mean, their [01:20:00] increase has been 10%. Year over year, maybe, you know, what's up? 

**Andy:** What does the company actually do? 

**Joe:** So this is the AC company. Oh, AC, AC refrigeration, you know, 2 million or 2. 1 million per year record year this past year, nothing huge, six employees, right?

But again, when I, when I, and the number again, for insurance, probably about right, what I would expect on 16, 000 a year. But when I look at the number of employees haven't changed and that sort of thing, I never knew that there was dynamic where payroll, just the payroll expense goes up or your revenues go up policy goes up.

I do have 1 other question. Um, the seller owns the property, not selling it. He'd be maintained as a landlord. Um, is it I wonder, and we won't know until we get more into due diligence. Hopefully is, uh, you know, can they sometimes share in the expense of their. Real estate into the business as well. Not necessarily keeping it [01:21:00] clean.

That sort of thing. 

**Andy:** Yeah, it's God or what? What state are you in? Florida. Okay. I don't know if Florida has it. I'm feeling really Texas centric today. I don't know why, but like the Texas Realtors Association has this God awful lease agreement that I assume Florida has it too. But basically you can check these boxes of who pays for what?

And in a couple of cases, I've seen people just get these like buyers get just terrible lease agreements that are super sellable, super seller favorable, right? Yeah. So, to answer your question, um, the leases are, you know, typically the lease is negotiable if you truly are triple net, triple, truly true, true, true triple net, the, the seller can have basically no exposure to paying for insurance, paying for upkeep and maintenance, you know, like there, there, there are leases that From a, [01:22:00] from a buyer's perspective or lessee's perspective, it's like, you may as well own the property.

Like there's no seller has all the upside. You have all the downside. Um, so that's just something to be mindful of. Uh, sometimes seller owns real estate and like, they've got other operations in that same building. In that case, to me, for what it's worth, whenever you can push the cost of the actual building insurance to the seller, it's better to take yourself out of that.

Sort of like if there were a fire, do you want to be between the seller and the insurance company? Not really. Right. You'd want it to be, sorry, Mr. Seller, Mr. Landlord. Now you've got to deal with the insurance company for your property claim. Yeah. Okay. 

**Joe:** Uh, possibly, I think last question I wrote down, um, is, Oh my gosh, I'm stumping.

Oh, what was it? Oh, um, had to [01:23:00] do with, uh, and I'm sorry if you brought this up going through due diligence. Is it, is it appropriate for me to ask, Hey, share with me your insurance policy and what your coverages were? 

If you already 

**Joe:** talked about that, apologies, I missed it, but that just seems like kind of straight to what their coverages were, see if they were under.

**Andy:** It's 100%. It's really funny. I don't know if you know Jackie Hirsch. She's a business broker in Florida, but, um, and Jackie's great, but this is a conversation I've had with her many times. She sells businesses mostly. Um, if the sellers are being. You know, can't be about, Oh, what do you need to see our policies for?

What do you need to see our loss runs for? That's I don't want to say it's a red flag, but it's, it is a hundred percent normal course of diligence on a business to look at the policies and look at the loss runs, um, to look at that for the audit statements. There's, there's a, there's a limit, right? Like.

[01:24:00] The type of diligence work we do on a million dollar business is different than what I'm going to do on a 50 million business. But to not ask for policies and for loss runs, there's really like five things. Policies, loss runs, applications, and premium audits. If you give me, that's four things, isn't it?

If you get those four things just specific to insurance, and they shouldn't be usually, usually your legal diligence, diligence will look for the policies to loss runs. So this is the, this is the kind of stuff that drives me crazy. Well, like a lot of lawyers doing diligence on S and B deals, they'll have a question on their data request list.

Has the company had any claims in the last five years? And that's kind of like asking, I don't know, it's just, it's so generic. It doesn't tell you what you need to know. It's like saying, do you have a, how'd you get here today? Did you take a car? Do you have a car? All I know is that you have a car. You know, you know what I mean?

Like, you could have taken a Porsche, you could have taken a VW bus, and how I, if they had any claims in the last five years, it's like, don't even ask, [01:25:00] just ask for the loss runs, and then you typically have to explain, oh, you have to ask your insurance broker for that, it's no big deal, totally normal, if they ask why you're asking for them, tell them it's because you're getting a bank financing.

**Athena:** Yes. And something Joe to point out is, you know, what we recommend as soon as you get under LOI, you go out to your deal team, which ideally would include, you know, Andy and Josh and, you know, we have the Andy seen the master spreadsheet before of, like, everything and then you get your deal team to go in there and choose the things that they want to include so that you can just delete everything from there.

And then you've got a master list from all the folks that are going to be involved in the process. Your lender, your legal insurance due diligence, your finance due diligence. You have a list of everything that you're going to need from Mr. Seller as part of your diligence. So then you can make sure, and that's another reason to engage them kind of earlier in the process, is they'll get you a list of all the things that you should be asking [01:26:00] for.

So that, you know, when you present the Very intimidating, crazy lists of 100 things that you need from Mr. Seller. The insurance policies are in there and I've worked on deals with Andy too. So, like, where it gets confusing, like, they will, um, you know, help you communicate or communicate directly with the seller or the sellers insurance folks to help get what they need.

So they can see that, um, forgive me if I'm, I'm misrepresenting how y'all will interact, but they can be with you. Asset to that conversation too. Cause it's like, you, you probably don't know what you're supposed to be asking for a seller doesn't know what they should be getting. So Andy and his team are really good about helping, uh, you know, facilitate that and communicate the language there too.

**Andy:** Thank 

**Athena:** you. 

**Andy:** Yeah. You raised a really good point too, about the approach to data request lists and like, do you go in with the full list and then the seller knows what to expect over the next month or two, [01:27:00] or that seems to work better. Then trickling in. And if we come in late and say, Oh, by the way, here's what we need.

And then you got to sell her a deal fatigue. And you're like, wait, I have to go back. I already answered that question about claims and the legal diligence. Why do you need these loss runs? 

**Athena:** Right. Yeah. And then, you know, the amazing sheet that Anca has created, it allows you. To prioritize the different things.

So then you can say, like, who needs what? And what order? And so the seller is not like, holy shit, I need to get all 100 things equally. Right? It's like, well, let's get the most important things 1st, so we can rule out any, like, serious issues, right? Like, loss runs or something like that. Uh, and then looking at other policies down the line to or other documents down the line.

So, um, Joe, when, when you get this. Deal signed it. Highly recommend, you know, getting with Andy ASAP and seeing what kind of documents that they need. So you can include that on your diligence list. Did your [01:28:00] question come back to you while I bought you some time or. 

**Joe:** Oh, that was it. That was the question.

And I kind of wrote it down, but it didn't make sense to me as I was reading it, because I wrote it so fast. Um, yeah, those are all my questions. Thank you for allowing me to ask. 

**Athena:** Awesome. Well, um, exciting times for Joe. We're, we're close. And then, um, Andy, this was, uh, really illuminating and really useful.

Um, we're going to be recording this and putting it on the platform. So everybody can watch. This will also be sharing your details so they can get in touch with you at the appropriate time to talk all things insurance. Um, and any other last. Thoughts or key tips that you think is important for people about to sign offers and purchase businesses?

Uh, 

**Andy:** I wish I, I should come up with a better part in words. I don't know. It's a lot to think about. 

**Athena:** It is, yeah, it's a lot. [01:29:00] Uh, we, we just had a client earlier that said, We, you know, you just got assigned L O I and he's like, I realize I'm like at the base of the mountain now. And, you know, it's like now the hard work actually starts.

So, uh, yeah, there's a lot, a lot more after, after getting the offer, but with the right support, like yourself around you, um, you can cover all the bases and learn things probably more deeply. Like, I think going through the insurance due diligence process, you're going to learn about insurance more deeply as a business owner than you would just.

You know, maybe being a new business owner and getting a policy. So it's kind of cool. Actually, I think a really great learning process to learn. What are the things that could impact me? Like, I really need to pay attention to that X mod score as an owner, whereas a new owner might not realize. How important that is, or how detrimental it is down the line.

So really cool, uh, uh, stuff and learning. And I love how passionate you are about finding these little things and stuff like that. Like, that's exactly what [01:30:00] you want on your team. Like, someone that's going to totally like. Geek out and get excited about finding something on one of the documents. It's like, oh, that is a mismatch.

**Andy:** I can leave you with one thing that it's that the somebody brought this up to me and said, well, you guys get paid on commissions for the policies you sell us. Don't you have an incentive to try to sell us more insurance? Um, and, uh, you know, the, my response to that is sure. If I only want to sell you insurance once and want to ruin my reputation.

Um, so for, for as excited I get about is the aha moments. Um, you know, I had a, I had a call with one of your clients tonight, last night, and we spent 45 minutes going through the insurance program. And I said, you know what, guys, basically everything's okay. These premiums are unadjustable, the losses are pretty good, they got a million dollars in auto liability, I'd like to see a little bit more, but, you know, can't, can't argue with that, um, and so [01:31:00] probably six, seven times out of ten, it's a rubber stamp, everything's okay, you're good to go.

Um, that's more often than not, but it's, it's those times where, to me, that's where the value is, is when we keep somebody from doing a bad deal or been doing a bad deal, I mean, overpaying. And then you find out after the fact, you weren't expecting a cost to go up where you have these claims or whatever it is, and that's, that's fun for me.

So that's the part I get excited about. But it's not, you know, if it's good, it's good. We just tell people that to 

**Athena:** love it. I love I love how y'all operate. I've been getting to know Andy and Josh really well over the last year or so. And I think everybody knows how how much I value integrity and good working practices and good culture and values.

And they certainly have that, which is why I am also. Uh, working with them, I think we need to get it switched over to the new 1 now,

like, support the new [01:32:00] business too, because I pushed you into this. I was like, don't you dare stop doing this go out on your own. So I'm so glad Andy. Thank you. So much. Uh, really appreciate all the time expertise. We'll be sharing your details with everybody and the recording on the platform. And, uh, I'm sure you'll be hearing from a lot of these folks soon because we got a lot of new deals coming up.

**Andy:** Awesome. Thanks so much for having me. Appreciate it. 

**Athena:** Cool. Thanks. 

**Andy:** See you later.
