![][image1]SETTING THE DESTINATION EXERCISE **SETTING THE DESTINATION EXERCISE** 

Get a journal or something to physically write with. We suggest printing out these questions or writing them down so you don’t get distracted by being on a device. 

**Set aside 45 minutes to an hour of quiet time to answer these questions at a time when you are not agitated or pressed for time.** 

**Put your phone and laptop in another room so you aren’t distracted.** 

When answering these questions, try not to include material things (like an amount of money) and instead focus on feelings and surroundings that you can’t necessarily put a value on. 

For example, instead of saying you want to ‘buy a $3 million house’ think of what you actually want from a house. Do you want to feel like you’re in a stable, beautiful environment? What does that house look like? What features are in it? Where is it? Focusing on the feelings and features then allow you to set more measurable targets at a later stage \- this is not that exercise. 

Part 1 \- 

● Why did I decide to look at buying a business? What feelings was I having to feel like I wanted to explore this and what do I hope to get out of it? 

● What are my strengths, my unique talents, the things I do that I feel proud of? ● What activities do I most enjoy spending my time doing and why? 

● If you were to meet you 5 years from now, what would your life be like? (be specific, where are you living, what the environment looks, feels, smells like, who are you with, what do you feel like, how are you spending your days?)

Part 2 \- Now let’s envision what a perfect day would look like for you sometime in the future 

(Write out a letter to yourself so you can really feel what this looks like and consider including:) 

● What time do you wake up? 

● Where do you wake up? What do you see, what does it look like, smell like, feel like? Is anyone with you? 

● What is the weather like? 

● Do you have a morning routine? If so, what does your morning routine consist of? ● What types of activities do you do throughout the day? 

● What do you eat and drink throughout the day? Where do you eat and drink? Are you alone or with other people? Do you make your own food or does someone else? ● If you do work, what types of work activities do you do (i.e. meetings, client proposals, etc), how much of your day are you doing it, what is the purpose of your work? 

● Do you do any exercise, if so, why type and for how long? 

● Did you see anyone else that day? If so, who? What do you do together? ● Do you have an evening routine? If so, what does it consist of? 

● What time do you go to bed? 

● How do you feel as you lie in bed? 

Part 3 \- Now that you have an idea of your perfect day, answer these questions 

● What does success look like for ME (again focus on feelings not outcomes)? 

● What am I doing to hold myself back from achieving my perfect day / success / happiness? 

● Knowing where you want to go, and where you are currently, what would make you happy to achieve in 3 months time with your work and future business? (remember focus on feelings /lifestyle rather than specific outcomes \- if you want an outcome, why and what will this help you feel?)

**![][image3]**SETTING THE DESTINATION EXERCISE Part 4 \- Next, answer these questions about alignment. 

● Why do you want to quit your job / buy a business? How does this fit into your vision of your perfect day / life in 5 years? 

● What parts of your current day to day / job are in misalignment with what you want your perfect day to look like? 

● What emotions come up when you think about what you want and what you’re doing now? 

● What did this exercise teach you about yourself?
