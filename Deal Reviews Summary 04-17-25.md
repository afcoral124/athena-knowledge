  Okay, and someone talks so I can hear if my sounds working.

0:08 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah, you're good. Sounds good.

0:11 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  It's not connecting to my speaker though.

0:13 - Anke Badenhorst
  So let's see. Test days one, two, Yeah, yeah, yeah.

0:18 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay, cool. Let's see if it stays connected. I need to get some computer speakers. Awesome. Hey, everyone.

0:24 - Luke Gillespie
  Lots of faces.

0:26 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Exciting. We are starting to populate the agenda. So Luke and David, nothing for the agenda today by the looks of things.

0:38 - Luke Gillespie
  Is that correct? Correct.

0:40 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay, cool. So Kate, something to add for mid month. So we should have done this on Tuesday, but I didn't realize it was mid month.  So just check in on our reporting number. So we could just add that to the agenda for every like mid month.  For us. So I've wanted. But out in a month, is that right? Yeah, last month was our biggest month.  We had 18 for the total month. And if your numbers in the sheet are correct at 21, then that means we've already exceeded our highest month.  So. It's pretty exciting. What would you put that down to, Luke?

2:29 - Luke Gillespie
  In doing a lot more broker calls being less discretionary with the write-ups and just being more efficient, just pumping them out a lot more, I guess.

2:40 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay. then other ones that you're putting out if we're being less discretionary are the clients locking into them, or is that not working being less discretionary?

2:50 - Luke Gillespie
  They're not interested. Yeah, they're still locking into them because what I was doing before was, it's like I was making the decision for them, right?  canceling deals for them. But Ryan told me. us not do that. We want to let them make their own decisions.  And there were multiple deals, like SP trucking company that they sent the LOI on that I had rejected at first and put into low priority.  And then I took it out of low priority and pushed it to arrive to SP. They ended up submitting an LOI.  There were multiple other companies like that. That one for Jason, that SaaS company that he was super excited about, I had initially rejected as well.  I went back into the low priority section and turned it around until right up to Jason, and he was actually really excited about it.  The plant shop for Dustin and Lindsey, same exact thing. I had rejected it initially, but then after changing things, I went back into low priority, turned around for pet of, and now they're trying to submit an LOI on it.  So yeah, mostly that probably.

3:48 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  That's interesting. So is our prioritization system working, or should we be removing that?

3:57 - Luke Gillespie
  No, the prioritization system is still. good. It was just me, like I was the one choosing yes or no on these deals and I had to be more yes and less no and that's what helped improve things.

4:10 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So yeah, it was my fault. Awesome. And then you just scheduling the broker calls is getting me more at that.

4:17 - Luke Gillespie
  That helps a lot. Yeah, I just do broker calls all day.

4:22 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Awesome. so the numbers aren't shared with me. It looks like there's 19 write-ups in HubSpot but we're showing 21 in the deal numbers.

4:32 - Luke Gillespie
  Okay, let me count right here. Okay, so that's interesting. I don't know why this switch since 21 because I'm counting 20 on my personal notes where I track every write up I do.  HubSpot is going to show 19 because there was that one tap out tuning where we gave it to Jenny and then recycled it over to BH.  So HubSpot is Accurate only showing 19 my numbers are technically accurate saying 20 because I'm just counting the tap out tuning as to write up because we did it for Jenny and BH.  I don't know why the spreadsheet says 21 unless are you including today's numbers. Let me see.

5:17 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Maybe I'm just looking at the total for the month.

5:21 - Luke Gillespie
  Okay. We have that calculated 21. Yes. Okay. That's because there's one right up in that I just added in the spreadsheet that I literally just finished before this call that I haven't updated on HubSpot.

5:34 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay.

5:35 - Luke Gillespie
  I should have just updated it now, actually.

5:38 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay. Cool. And then, is there something we can do about the recording if we recycle a write up in HubSpot then because it technically is a write up her client.

5:53 - Anke Badenhorst
  Yes, there is. I'll think about it. remember we did it in the past. I just need to remember what we did.  because this came up before we recycled it right up. it needs to be marked as one for, who was the original client?

6:08 - Luke Gillespie
  But Jenny.

6:09 - Anke Badenhorst
  And so it needs to be marked to, it needs to have two, it needs to be displayed as two, yeah.  So yeah, I think we cloned the deal last time. So it displays as one for each client. Then we might as lost for, let's say, Jenny passed on it.  So we marked it as passed from Jenny. And then we marked it as, you know, proceeded on for whoever the new client is.  That's what we did.

6:35 - Luke Gillespie
  And we'll need to do that. So the numbers reflect accurately.

6:41 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Awesome. So Anka, can you pull up the numbers per client so you can just do a check in mid month and Luke, you can kind of think on how we're looking for it.  it looks like some are great. Some we haven't gotten any yet. So I just love a kind of overview of where we're at.

6:57 - Anke Badenhorst
  Yeah, I have my own list as well.

7:00 - Luke Gillespie
  It's in a screenshot.

7:01 - Anke Badenhorst
  It might not look like as good as on cuz though.

7:04 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Oh, one sec guys. forgot to close my door while you pull it up. Okay.
  SCREEN SHARING: Anke started screen sharing - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/278733478?timestamp=449.292423

7:26 - Anke Badenhorst
  Okay, so I just sent a request for thank you. Okay, so this is on market only this view.

7:39 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, 30 right? Yeah, great.

7:44 - Anke Badenhorst
  Yeah, so we're already at 19 on market. Okay, let's say let's say, sorry, that's one more. So we're already at 21 on markets.  The one is the duplicate one we're gonna sort out in the reporting and the other one. Luke says he store has to move.  So. This is the status for the different clients that has received on-market write-ups and they have not received on-market write-ups.

8:09 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay. Luke, talk me through, we know where we're at with AA, talk through some of the ones that are on the lower side, particularly the zeros.

8:22 - Luke Gillespie
  Yes. Okay. So on the lower side, JB, we know how Tampa is always low deal flow there. I got on that really good medical sales company, which it looks like he was pretty excited about.

8:33 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  I have another write-up sitting in the do write-up stage for him that I'm about to do. So I already have a second one for him.

8:40 - Luke Gillespie
  As far as SP, yeah, I just haven't had anything for SP and maybe just because of the monthly situation, anything that was coming in at an area we were pushing for Jason.  As you know, Atlanta is also one of our struggling loads.

10:00 - David R
  or SP, I've seen few deals for them, but I wouldn't say it is great. Like I've seen very low priorities for SP.  Yeah, probably I might need to do some hunting for SP as well to see if there is anything that we haven't picked up.

10:19 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  And are we looking in Florida and Pensacola for them?

10:24 - David R
  Because that's where the throwing company is.

10:26 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So like even with that, there's not many opportunities or what's going on there.

10:33 - David R
  Yeah, I've seen a few in these areas as well. I also, I usually push like some marketing companies. When I see there is like remote company marketing company, I usually push them for SP.  I actually, I remember yesterday, I push a marketing company for, it looked kind of cool for them. So maybe it works.  But yeah, we also look at this other area in Florida.

11:01 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay, and we, so we're happy through gotten zero, they passed on the catering line and that was a super competitive one of the towing so.  I would like by Tuesday to hear what we're doing to make sure that we're not just blaming Atlanta.

11:21 - Anke Badenhorst
  Yeah, there's three, there's three ASP some received in the same bank look for you.

11:30 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay. Okay, so potentially some opportunity so shoot me a quick note then or come on Tuesday, let me know if any of those are looking good.  If they're not, then let David know so that you guys can come up with a plan for how we make sure that SP.  I want all the clients always working on a deal so we're not doing the priority client thing but this is why we do the mid month check in so that we can troubleshoot.

12:00 - Luke Gillespie
  any areas.

12:02 - Anke Badenhorst
  Just to add to that, there is one broker who already has a broker who is scheduled for ASP and then looks like he does in the process of scheduling another one for ASP as well.  So three deals in the Simbank, one already scheduled, about to be scheduled.

12:18 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Fantastic. Okay, cool. How about BH?

12:22 - Luke Gillespie
  I would say same thing, just low deal flow and Jackson, but I don't see much. Yeah, I haven't seen many deals for him.  I feel like better to talk about these things is more David and either because they're the ones who get the deals in front of me while I just hop on broker calls and do reps.  you know what I mean? But I know it's not the answer you want. say the same thing, low deal flow and Jackson bill.  But given that he's opened up to more online businesses, we could put more of an emphasis on to finding him a better online business.  I guess it would also be kind of the same thing that we've had in our past of not really prioritizing BH because he's not one of our most responsive clients, um, which I don't.  Did we get that intro on the last one? He was asking about deal costs and things like that, and Ryan explained it to him over a slack message, and he hasn't messaged it since, since nothing has happened since.

13:47 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay, so Paul's in his court on that last one?

13:50 - Luke Gillespie
  Yes.

13:53 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay, there's three for him. Say that again, Anka.

13:59 - Anke Badenhorst
  Three, six. because in the Simbangs for BH.

14:02 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay.

14:03 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah. And all these Sims that are sitting in the Simbang for SP and BH, they're these really low-quality internet online companies that, you know, those online Sims, they're very easy to get.  They're not very high value, so I know they're deals that these guys just aren't really going to like that much, but I guess I should just be more open-minded and start pushing them.  given that it's this far in the month, we haven't gotten anything for them.

14:29 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  And for SP, especially, I'll start pushing those online companies. Yes, and is this Brian's final month or is next month, if he were to end at six months?

14:45 - Anke Badenhorst
  I may confirm that. So BH is currently in his fifth month, so it's December, January, February, March, May. May would be six months.

15:24 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay. Ryan, what was your last touch with him? Was it on a website one?

15:32 - AcquiMatch Team
  No, we spoke prior to that. My last conversation was that he wanted to open up geographically. we added some more cities for small cities, but within the Jacksonville area.  And he said he would like, he's kind of giving up on the business that he has right now. It's just not making the cash that can support him to live.  So what he'd like. So what he'd like to do is, if he can, think his teeth into something. He would consider, I think he would consider staying with us, and make this the main business, and then he would try to hire an operator to currently run what he's doing now based on what he's learned from this.

16:13 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Oh, I was right. That's frustrating because he couldn't use that money to buy something that would have done the thing in the first place.  Okay, so it sounds like he's having a realization that he got into something not good, so we still need to deliver the service.  So Luke, are you and I understand, are we like maybe subconsciously deprioritizing Brian because of how he's been acting?  I think that would be true to say, yeah. Okay, cool. So let's let's fire out some, you know, he did listen a little bit.  It seems like it takes a couple of times, but he didn't listen. and review it, that sort of thing.  He's also opened up the search. And if he had the realization with Ryan that he got into something that's not a great match, then now that he has paid money and maybe has more of an appetite, we should be delivering something.  But if it's what you assume are low-quality internet businesses, might be interesting to him.

17:23 - Luke Gillespie
  And also, we know he doesn't have a ton of cash available to invest, so smaller internet businesses might be the right fit for him, given that.

17:33 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So, Ryan, based on your latest conversations about where he's at, do we need to make refinements to his dual box?

17:43 - AcquiMatch Team
  Or is all of that all up to date? Well, that's up to date. Weirdly enough, I actually think, if we get Brian a business, he will buy it.  The reason I say that is because he bought a business on his own.

18:00 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah.

18:00 - AcquiMatch Team
  started multiple of his own businesses. He's actually just a little bit strange, but I think he'll buy a business.  We just have to get the right business in front of him. He would like something correlated, so Luke actually did get him something correlated.  was online, and he seems to have a little bit trouble with that. He also got the SEO company, which is another online business.  I had a call with him about that. He seemed like he felt little bit uncomfortable at the online aspect.  Even though he still says he's open to it, he pretty much says, it can't be anything technical. I can't do that.  He gets caught up there. If we could find him any type of service, he bought a hard-scaping business. We could find him any type of service business in a relative location to support Jacksonville.  I think he'll buy it on that, especially with our help. So I think, I think he's the type of person he sees something, he knows immediately, it's not for him.  And so that's why we don't get responses, but I think if we get him something that lines up with him, I actually think we'll get him engaged.

19:12 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah, and he's done that on parent deals. So David, from now on, we're looking at deals, anything in Jacksonville, even if it's smaller, because as we can tell from the business he already bought, Brian's not that picky, even if there might be some red flags.  If it's that physical hands-on blue collar, services business, anything to do with cars, mechanics, anything like that, anything with landscaping, construction, HV, plumbing, we've learned that Brian does really like those types of businesses.

19:42 - David R
  push those as high priority. All right.

19:47 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  He used to run a cheap rental company out of Hawaii. Yeah, are we in jeeps, I think, wasn't it?  Offering vehicles, there was something.

20:00 - Luke Gillespie
  There was like those RVs, those spritter vans that people are.

20:03 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Anyways, but like he's been a business owner before or two. So, but even the hard-scaping was just like outside of his wheelhouse with what we would expect.  So I think we could be quite loose with industry so long. And you know, I'd say yellow flags are okay, red flags, bad business buys.  But, yeah, so yellow is okay, you never know with him, and let's try to get him some more volume, right?  Because we've dripped the volume because he wasn't up for it, from what Ryan's saying he is now turning his attention here.  He did pay us quite a bit of money, and we didn't have to do a ton of work for him given his situations.  So, it would be good to, like, now that he is actually interested, like to deliver him the service that he paid for.  So let's get a focus on that also.

21:04 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah, yeah. And you know, that's that's going to take all three of us, David, Ryan and me, all David's got to do it on the front end, I'll find something in the in between.  And then Ryan, you've got to really push on Brian to get him on a call. He has the same five percent, 10 percent injection about every deal, Ryan.  think he doesn't quite grasp a concept of how kind of open ended these deals are. And he just sees a purchase price, multiple 10 percent of that price and thinks of how much cash he has and thinks it doesn't work for him.  If you've noticed that, Ryan, does that. He's done that multiple times on the deals we presented him. So he definitely needs some, some more coaching, some more understanding, some more advising.

21:45 - AcquiMatch Team
  Yeah, it'll take some hand holding, but if we get him something, I think, I think we can do it.

21:50 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah. Well, we know, we know he shoots from the head. So it takes action. Like let's let's steer him.

22:00 - AcquiMatch Team
  the right direction for his action and then maybe maybe you might be onto something there so okay great uh anything else on here you said jb we've got another one so we're at least already at the minimums for everybody by the look of it with that jb when you have coming through yes yes great um cool and then Ryan any pulse check on uh Jason and how he's feeling about continuing we've got less than two weeks left with him so we got a call this morning and we discussed an opportunity that luke got formed it's a really nice deal um it's big it's doing um $1.3 million even though um it's gonna it has no asking price it's about luke did a good job modeling it out about pushing the ds dr to about one point  at $5.5 million asking price. So we both kind of went over it today and he likes it. He's excited about it almost the point where he's like, no way I'm actually gonna, they're gonna sit at me for this.  There's already 19 I.O.I.s on this. So I tried to talk, I'm like, you can do this, look at this, look at this, we talked to many discussions and I gave him the advice you gave SPE, which was they're asking for I.O.I.s.  I said, submitting L.O.I. it's 4x multiple, 5%. They said that they're open to 10% note. So if you want to get aggressive and get in there, maybe do 5% note.  So 4x 5% note and then put a video yourself explaining why you're the right buyer, why you're excited about the opportunity, what's your background and then you have background experience and growing businesses and growing teams, as they mentioned, that goes as important to the seller.  And I'm Ashley, I think you're excited about the opportunity to move up to the conversation with yourself. So I gave him those four points to kind of touch on him a little video, and I think he already commented on the on it, like he said, we used to make the video and put together a VRR.

24:16 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  That's nice work. Okay, so no, no update on whether he's kind of working on this.

24:24 - AcquiMatch Team
  So in terms of the update, based on how my conversation is going, I wanted to set up call for him next week, sorry, for Tuesday, submit the LMI, do a video, you're going to get it, hopefully it's called scheduled.  You're going to have a broker conversation, which you already have today, so you got to speak with a broker, sorry, we'll go over all of those together next week.  So my goal is, instead of pushing, like putting the cart before the horse, speak to him next week, get him locked into this business and excited about it, and then ask him how he's feeling about it.  continuing since right now, we're coming up on the end of the month.

25:03 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay, well, keep Anka up to David Mack, she has to cancel the subscription if he doesn't want to end.  And then it sounds like JB's same thing, he's are still closing out at the end of the month.

25:18 - AcquiMatch Team
  I believe JB is going to close out. Same thing, I didn't bring it up again because my last conversation was little bit intense.  So I just try to make this one a little bit more mellow about business and business as usual. So he has that broker call right now for that business.  we speak, and so I'm going to follow up and see how that went. And then we have a call schedule for next week when we'll talk to you how the call went.  How are you feeling? Same kind of stuff.

25:52 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay, great. think he was on your update list too. So I'll come back to that, right?

25:57 - AcquiMatch Team
  Well, it was just not a finding that he's due. The customer concentration was at what we talked about yesterday.

26:08 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Is it like one decision maker or is it multiple decision makers at the same company?

26:13 - AcquiMatch Team
  So the JB one?

26:14 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah.

26:16 - AcquiMatch Team
  It's just one because it's not an office.

26:18 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  It's a doctor's office. Got it. Okay. So forgive it will not go if he really likes that.

26:27 - AcquiMatch Team
  That's, yeah, that's what we discussed.

26:29 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So same thing.

26:30 - AcquiMatch Team
  We discussed some ways to get past some hurdles. He actually knows the industry little bit, right? Because he's in medical sales himself.  So he has like better questions already than I have, right? So I was like, that's good. Like bring that thing again to that broker call and let him know.  And then maybe if you make an offer. So here's the interesting about this. This one is semi absentee. It's a little bit far from his house owner has some health problems.  I don't want to make that really sound like a positive, but the reality is that if you have

27:00 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  health problems, and I'm stroking with owners with health problems, they want to get out. That's great and stellar, yeah.

27:04 - AcquiMatch Team
  They'll take a massive dismount to just get out. Yeah. so I said, they might be in that position, build their relationship, show your experience, and maybe you can land a deal on this.  So that's, that's what our, our economic conversation was around.

27:18 - Luke Gillespie
  So he was, okay. She is in that position. She needs a double lung transplant.

27:24 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So, yeah. That sucks. Um, did he close out? You know?

27:31 - AcquiMatch Team
  He did close out.

27:32 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Do you know? Are you going to pick that one back up?

27:36 - AcquiMatch Team
  Yeah. Yeah. I got out of my schedule. wasn't sure. thought I always should, you know, just cold, cold, not the boat.

27:43 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  He, he, yeah. There's a phone, doesn't he?

27:45 - AcquiMatch Team
  He's like a phone call guy. He does.

27:47 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah. I would, I would sooner than later, right? Because he's actively wanted to sell. And I, I think that's such a great business.  Like, you know, see if he wants us to find him another buyer, or if he wants us to, and introduce him to a broker, but that could introduce a fee.  Me possibly get him a higher purchase price, but it might cancel out with the broker fee. So I would temperature check where he's at with that.  But I don't, when did Joe close out with him?

28:17 - AcquiMatch Team
  Friday.

28:18 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  This Friday, yeah. So can you do that before the end of the week, just so we don't leave it too long?

28:22 - AcquiMatch Team
  Because he might go out and get a broker in the meantime. Yeah, I should, I put, I had a marketing job for tomorrow morning.

28:29 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Perfect, great. Okay, on the Jenny off market one, I know you guys said there was like health problems and declining revenue, so it's not ideal this year, but were the revenue targets or were the, sorry, end of day brains not working, did the business achieve good numbers in the past?  And if so, does that present an off market performance? No opportunity. that we could put in front of Jenny.  Because it sounded like this owner also has health problems, right?

29:08 - AcquiMatch Team
  It was what he did him 1.2 million or no, 2023, right?

29:15 - Luke Gillespie
  Luke, do you have to call with him, Ryan?

29:17 - AcquiMatch Team
  No.

29:18 - Luke Gillespie
  OK, oh, just based off my call. Yeah, I mean, this is just what I was told on the very short five-minute qualifying call, Athena.  He said, had a traumatic brain injury 2024 and did like 350k revenue. But that was because of the injury before that years before that he said he was doing more like $1 billion of revenue.  So we don't know that much until Ryan talks to him. But also Ryan, I believe, wasn't this a tree service company?

29:46 - AcquiMatch Team
  Yeah.

29:47 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah, and I think Jenny just talked about that with a thief on her call.

29:53 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  She wanted to know more about it because she said there's a lot of she feels like there's a lot of competition.  But. Just when I hear a dip in revenue, think, forgivable note, and I, you know, like, and health powers is like they want to get out, so maybe, like, doesn't sound like the most recent financials are good, but if he has a methodology that he could teach her for her to get it back there, then she could do a forgivable note, like, if he's not, I don't know if he's, like, terminal or just not able to work anymore.

30:27 - Luke Gillespie
  It sounded like he was back on his feet now, but he was just blaming the last year on that.  Yeah, I don't know.

30:33 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Interesting. Why does he want to sell?

30:37 - Luke Gillespie
  He was just open and interested to it. I don't remember the emails in the Congo. Yeah.

30:45 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay. Cool.

30:51 - Luke Gillespie
  Ryan, do you have a call with that guy coming up?

30:54 - AcquiMatch Team
  Ida sent him an email asking if he can, if he's available next week. I also I had emailed him before and says there are you available the first thing called tomorrow called up with them and responded They got told you that you're you said that's how he is.

31:10 - Luke Gillespie
  He's probably not an email guy. I'd recommend giving him a call Or maybe I can just crack him in here.  already knows me.

31:19 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah Yeah, oh alright Okay Then okay, can you pull up the numbers um or do you want me to I have it here?  Your daily wonder is the y'all are tracking I mean I can pull though Okay cool So Just want it on the otherwise submitted Brian it seems like we're missing some
  SCREEN SHARING: Anke started screen sharing - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/278733478?timestamp=1903.566148  As well as client calls with owners. Do you know why those are zero when we know we had some submissions kind of Friday Monday.

32:17 - AcquiMatch Team
  Submissions.

32:20 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So Chris, minute and a while on Friday. Justin submitted an ally on Monday.

32:35 - AcquiMatch Team
  Okay, I'll get that updated.

32:37 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Well, just I would have a scan through last week. There was quite a few calls to so just scan through the threads, the hand over and just make sure these are up to date and then doing it on a daily because you have more conversations with them than we do.  So if they give you something on the call that they didn't necessarily put in the thread. Like I had a call with the owner, I did this, I did that.  I would really appreciate it if you could put it in here so that we have the full numbers. And then what I want us to do is when we start getting LOI submitted on these calls, we're going to talk through what made them want us to in an LOI so we can do that knowledge share with David and Luke.

33:26 - AcquiMatch Team
  Okay, well then.

33:27 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Sweet, thank you. Cool, Ryan, anything on the off market? haven't gotten any write-ups this week. I know it's just starting to pick up at any thoughts, early indications on how that's looking.

33:43 - AcquiMatch Team
  Okay, so yeah, interesting enough, yesterday I had like the best probably off-market call I've ever had. Unfortunately, he's looking for big money.  There's actually a trash, those big dumpsters that you put in front of construction sites and then I write the trash in there and y'all on the way.  Yeah. So, conversation went great and it was about a million dollars EBITDA, but you wanted, you wanted around 10 million dollars, so you wanted 10 X.  I had a conversation all about that. I'm like, well, as I stayed at the beginning, I worked with directly owner operators who they want to purchase the business themselves, they're most likely utilizing SBA.  He actually had utilized SBA to purchase the business themselves, so he's familiar. He said, oh, he's like, I'm just not looking for that type of buyer.  I'm really in and so private equity, I'm going to go until I get private equity on this thing. But we had a good conversation.  I just kind of ended it with like, hey, if you consider owner operator and if you're considering even I'm four, four and a half X, I'd love to get you on the phone with someone.  think we we have a buyer. I'm sure you know that you could sell this thing. And he said, all right, we'll keep you in mind.  So, anyways, what I told the team is like, what's good is that when I see things like conversations like that happening, I feel like we're, that's the right direction.  You know, big business, great conversation. Someone who has a big business and saw our written emails, went through the whole funnel, answered the questions, got a call set up with me.  It just shows me someone around that lady who's doing that, who's running a business like that, is going to have conversations with us.  that was my big takeaway from that. I had another call this week with a interface business, his staff, and a lot of sales are happening in Pakistan, so that was going to work.  But he was a smart guy, and like, I just, it's a conversation. station I enjoy having, and I think that our pipeline is putting out this kind of output where we're getting some quality owners on the call.

36:08 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Nice. So, I have it equity is not going to be 10 extra million and even either.

36:15 - AcquiMatch Team
  So, you told them that? I told them you're gonna have to get much higher than that. So he's just willing to have the conversation and see what you're willing to pay.  And I was like, okay, fair enough. He was like, he was smart, professional, handled the conversation well.

36:39 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  He knows he got, he knew how to do what he's doing. So, I'm thinking there needs to be like some sequence or grip that maybe David could help us like figure out or set up that when they, when their price is like out of whack, that we just like get it on a drip campaign from  big Ryan or fake Athena or whoever, but like, hey, know, like every month or whatever, like, hey, are checking in?  How are you feeling about selling now? Anything shifted. Something like that, because when they go out and have these other conversations, like at some point, it's going to be the right time to sell.  And they're going to be open to hearing what their business is actually worth. We just need to catch them at that right time.  Because the evaluation considerations like 10x, it's like that's we're probably the first person that's like shared that with them, that it's not possible.  So when they go out and have on their conversations, they might want to come back to us. But I think we should figure out an automation or a way to keep them warm.

37:47 - David R
  Okay, let's think about it.

37:49 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Because though, you know, eventually come back to us and they do circle back. mean, the one that Chris is working on right now is one that Ryan kept warm for like a year or so.  If there's a way for like, okay, they're not right right now or the value like it's a, you know, Diogation consideration wasn't in line, but they're open to selling then we have a sequence where it's just like, you know, Ryan checking it every month, like, hey, how's it, how's business going, you know, still considering selling, like, whatever, in the light that Ryan will say, and then we can add them into their sequences.  um, cool. Uh, also, Ida had in her report that they weren't sure if they should be rejecting something because it's too big.  I don't feel like we should, but if it's not right for clients, just want to double check that's your feelings about it too, Ryan.  Ryan?

38:51 - AcquiMatch Team
  Yeah, she's, um, she's mainly to saying like, that's not like, usually if that comes out up, she brings it up with the team on the team call.  Like, she's just, she's not certain on making that call ourselves. So we reviewed it as a team make, make a decision.  There was one recently that I think it looked like that, but we moved forward with it.

39:15 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, even if it is too big for clients, I don't want us to not move forward on it, because like, I want to get to the point where we have lots of deals.  So even if it's not right for one of our clients, we can do something with that deal.

39:30 - AcquiMatch Team
  So, there was one today that we did say no to, but a guy was very specific. Did you think you could pull that up, David?  Well, that discussion we had this morning about the size of deal.

39:52 - Luke Gillespie
  It's just being in the notion agenda.

39:56 - David R
  Yeah, let me see.

39:58 - Luke Gillespie
  I'm pulling it up too.

40:04 - David R
  I have it here.
  SCREEN SHARING: David started screen sharing - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/278733478?timestamp=2406.150977

40:10 - Luke Gillespie
  Do you have a date that I have it as well?

40:14 - David R
  Yeah, who's the one?

40:17 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah, right there. Double digit, even the multiple valuation price. You would be wasting your time. Double digit, even the dot.

40:40 - AcquiMatch Team
  It's starting to legally avoid capital gains tax, it refers to Lehman Formula Agency.

40:50 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Why did we eliminate this?

40:53 - Luke Gillespie
  As he says, he's doing double digit EBITDA and wants a double digit multiple.

41:05 - AcquiMatch Team
  Looking for a foreign investor, it was mainly just like he was very, very specific, exactly what he was looking for.  he said, unless you represent a truly strategic buyer to justify a double digit, even a multiple, you'll be wasting your time.  So I just kind of felt he was clear enough here to just say, this is what I'm looking for.

41:29 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  All right. How are they double digit EBITDA, he, business of double digit EBITDA, with an $8 million manufacturing business.

41:46 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah. He contradicts himself right there, less than $8 million niche with a history of double digit EBITDA. I mean, he's probably on the lower end, around $5 million EBITDA right now, but in the past that their PQ is doing double digit EBITDA.

42:00 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  did you even tell me because he was making masks and COVID or something and he's like I'm dying to legally avoid capital gains tax and any reverse layman formula agency fees like we don't charge fees right so he's engaging he's interested he's putting up a front but he doesn't understand how we operate and I'm a little confused with like we're an eight million dollar business but we have double digit EBITDA like what constitutes double digit yeah I'm assuming double digit million or I wouldn't be mentioning it because he said you can certainly call me at your convenience so like this to me is like he's throwing up some objections which but but behind all that he wants he wants to sell so like

43:02 - Luke Gillespie
  David, what do his previous responses look like? Scroll down. Oh, no, go to the top and click e-mails, score the top and click e-mails, yeah, right there.  Okay.

43:16 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  can just click the three.

43:18 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah. Oh, yeah.

43:24 - David R
  Oh, that's the only response we got.

43:26 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  It might take a more thoughtful response, but he's engaging with us and supposedly is a profitable business and doesn't want brokers to take a big old fee.  Well, guess what? don't. So, like, but not really sure through this e-mail what his actual numbers look like. So, you know, this to me is like warrants a phone call and so we already rejected it.  Yes. Okay. Um, that's a shame on that email above dinner. We shouldn't be giving valuations and emails and that is not something I've passed along, so that's on me, but we always want to move them to a phone call, right?  So like having these discussions over email, we lose the opportunity to actually like develop a relationship and overcome some of those objections.  So let's bring some of these responses to these calls where you guys are stuck so I can give some feedback too and we can start sharing that knowledge of how we, you know, this is a sales process essentially.  So that would be like somebody being like, I'm not paying for search services and we're like, okay, well, you know, we charge 100,000.  So, and then like they don't know anything about what we do. who or what value we bring, we haven't developed a relationship, established credibility, so we don't want to be giving folks prices before we have a conversation.  If it looks like they might be a potential match, so then we want to move to phone call, right?  Because phone call is where we can establish relationship, et cetera, et cetera. So, you guys didn't do anything wrong here, but I'm seeing an opportunity for me to share some more thoughts on how we can handle some of these responses when they come through.  So, why don't you guys bring some of these where you're stuck, right? Or like that it's like , haven't seen something like this and we can use some of our time on these calls to go through like how we might respond and overcome the objections to get them on a phone call.

45:47 - Luke Gillespie
  So, Athena, then when we get on that phone call, what would we say if phone call and then we find out most likely this guy's way too big doing $5 million of EBITDA.

46:00 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  It's not too big though so I don't want us eliminating anything because we think it's too big.

46:08 - Luke Gillespie
  Okay.

46:09 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Do you know why I'm saying that?

46:13 - Luke Gillespie
  So we couldn't pass it off as a referral to a broker?

46:18 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah potentially or like you know long-term my aim is for us to potentially trial a broker. So depending on where this is at, what it looks like etc.  I don't want us turning down like great opportunities or like potentially great opportunities. Where is he based?

46:36 - David R
  He's seen North Carolina.

46:38 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay. I don't think there's any real estate restrictions there. So don't pass on deals because they're too big. If you don't know how to respond like you know or if it's like a too big bring it to this call.  This is what this time is for you guys too. It's like like Athena's strategy time. But also I want to make sure that we're not.  emanating businesses that we could potentially use in different ways, not necessarily for clients. We just haven't had the volume.  We haven't had any excess deals. We haven't had those responses yet to be able to do anything like that.  So that's why I've been also pushing on off market is like, let's see what we can do here, you know, because if we're sourcing these great deals, we could potentially like learn more about how to facilitate these opportunities and get these larger opportunities and get over those objections, then it's a great learning opportunity for us.  Yeah, I mean, said he was open to a phone call, so I would like bring it to this and then we talk about the strategy on the phone call, and it's really overcoming objections and just like doing that exploration.  you know, we haven't had so many calls that we get to like really refine the scripts and how we do things.  So we're gonna to do this like in the moment but I wouldn't even I would at this point I wouldn't even respond to the email just go straight to phone call and then we could talk about what the strategy on that phone call could be.
  ACTION ITEM: Draft response to Ellen re NC manufacturing business; bring to Tuesday meeting - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/278733478?timestamp=2883.9999

48:14 - Luke Gillespie
  Okay.

48:16 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So we might be able to get this one back and be like you know call them up also let's make sure we're selling their names right.  Oh wow yeah so we don't you know there's so many like spam thingies out there and like bots and AI that we want like something really really important when we do this to just make sure that we're you know alluding to the fact that we are actually an individual and this is coming from me too so I always reread people's names before I send emails so you guys are speaking as me if you're speaking as me I definitely want to know how we're responding um
  ACTION ITEM: Write Athena-voice email to Ellen re no broker fees; review Tues - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/278733478?timestamp=2932.9999  So, we might be able to get this one back, reply as me and be like, Hey, Ellen, I thought your business was interesting.  I actually had a chat with my network. Um, actually have something interesting for you. I'd love to get you on a call with someone from my team.  They need to ask a few more questions to see where you're at, but just heads up. But we don't charge.  You know, we don't charge any broker fees like all of our fees come from the buyer. So there's no reverse laymen issues there.  So what do you draft up a response?'all bring it back to me on Tuesday and then we can strategize about how we do the phone call.  Sound good.

49:47 - Luke Gillespie
  Perfect.

49:48 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Cool. And then, um, David, I think you're, you're heading up the responses here, right?
  ACTION ITEM: Have Eda compile email templates doc for Athena review on Tuesday - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/278733478?timestamp=2989.9999

49:55 - David R
  Is that right? This one was, you know, but it can get.

49:59 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay. So. Why not before Eda sends it? Let's get her to just like bank some that she's not sure how to respond.  Let's not give evaluation on emails anymore. And I would love to see the templates too that we're using for Eda to send out just so I can send check those and see if there's any opportunity for me to add some value in terms of how we need to respond to those.  So who would that sit with, Anka?

50:31 - Luke Gillespie
  Normally when Eda's not sure on her response like she coordinates with me and I tell her what to say.  Okay. This one I guess we talked about on the call today and and yeah Eda sent this out. As far as the templates and everything I don't interact with that I'd be Anka and Eda and David.
  ACTION ITEM: Schedule Athena's off-market response training w/ team post-Austin onboarding - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/278733478?timestamp=3047.9999

50:48 - Anke Badenhorst
  Yeah when Eda's back on Tuesday I'll have her bring up a document for you not to take a look at all the templates that she's using.

50:58 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Great. Okay and then. And let's schedule some time, Kate, like maybe in the coming weeks, once Austin's up and running for me to do some training with the team on off-market.  So I can kind of, I know it's evolved a lot. So get a look at everything that's going on and see if we can just do a training on how I would respond to these, where their objections might be coming from, that sort of thing.  So I can make sure that I'm supporting you guys with the insights from everything. Like I went through when I was getting those responses and that sort of thing.  So it's kind of the telephone game at this point because it's been handed over so many times and you didn't have sales training.  So I also don't want to leave her in a situation where we might be, you know, might end up being a great opportunity.

51:51 - Kate Kelley
  Great. I will look into getting that scheduled.

51:54 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Thank you. Cool. Great. I totally lost track because we dove into this one but otherwise it sounds like off-market efforts are paying off.  Hey David we're getting more leads we identified some like things that we're stopping at anything else worth noting there are you feeling good like we're gonna get that volume back up?

52:19 - David R
  No I mean we're still working on that it's speaking up but I think there is still room for improvement so I'm just looking at the every campaigns and trying to see what's performing good and what's not and trying to understand where we can improve the different things that we're doing.

52:40 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay cool so Anka you can or wait note David you can stop sharing screen for second so Eda's off tomorrow Monday what's the plan to make sure that there's not an interruption in her absence?

53:00 - David R
  Yeah, we talked about it this morning.

53:02 - Luke Gillespie
  It came up with a document and it signed everyone responsibilities and signed off on it.

53:07 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay, good. we're not just going to stop it as work. We're going to be dividing and conquering amongst us so there's no interruption to deal flow.

53:15 - Luke Gillespie
  Yes.

53:16 - Anke Badenhorst
  You didn't agree with Bob just as you wanted Athena, she gave a great hand over to us.

53:21 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Amazing. I am not surprised.

53:23 - Anke Badenhorst
  She's very good at that. Go ahead, Anka. Very colorful as well. she added a big list for on-market, big list of markets.  She signed a college to each team member and then she assigned different tasks that made sense in terms of who has access to what and who's kind of like in that space already.  And then in the pool this morning we went through it all and then everybody was supposed to throughout the day reach out to either if they had questions or needed some training on their specific aspects.  So my loom videos for everybody song. trust that everybody did that today and reached out to either. if they were unsure about their roles that was assigned to them.

54:05 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Well, everybody looked at Edith's hand over the day.

54:10 - Luke Gillespie
  Where did she send it though? It was in the agenda this morning. Oh, okay. That's where I find it.

54:20 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay, cool. Awesome. That was all my stuff. So Ryan, over to you.

54:30 - AcquiMatch Team
  So it's maybe just kind of updates here. I just had about two hours go between A.H. and the off-market seller.  And I think it went really well. I think it went to the point where I think don't want you to deal.  some things that were brought up is that he would prefer a stock sale versus a asset sale. So it's something that's going to to be researched in terms of Canadian businesses.  We're saying I think the thing to do is purchase the business as a stock sale via Canada and then switch the entity to the US entity.  He was like that's my suggestion or something like that. So it's something that Andrew's not going to need to work into and model out on the model, stock recycling equity, a stock versus asset sale, get the SDE amount to get the cash flow and that service to it's working for him.  the numbers to say we've discussed that before. So get it to where it's going to be the same number from him regardless and say if you're like, this is what we agreed on an asset sale, here's how it would work for me on an equity sale with that work for you.  I believe it will based on what he said capital gains. eyes. So I think Andrew might have some cushion there if he wants to go that route, but it brings up like some red, some alarms for injuries.  Like I don't really know anything about stocks, you know, I hear there's liability involved. So that was his first reaction.

56:14 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  I don't know how it works like cross-country too. So like I could, you know, he could potentially do an F-reord per stock sale here, but like he needs to get a professional advice at this point.  So is that what he's planning on doing?

56:35 - AcquiMatch Team
  So his question was, do you guys know about who I should look to for this?

56:42 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  First I'd speak to Barlow Williams. I'm assuming they have experienced buying a Canadian business if they're still continuing to advise him on this.

56:52 - AcquiMatch Team
  So that's what I suggested. He said, I'm not sure if they're going to know the answer, and they're going to charge me a fee just to speak to him.  He's like, I'd rather You know if there's someone more direct I can speak to with this.

57:03 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Wait, did he not get their advisement on this in the first place?

57:08 - AcquiMatch Team
  He did.

57:10 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay.

57:11 - AcquiMatch Team
  So I imagine they're going to charge me more money.

57:16 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  To advise them on a deal that they're probably going to be drawing up the agreement.

57:21 - AcquiMatch Team
  That's what he That's weird.

57:29 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  He's going to have to do that all the way anyway.

57:36 - AcquiMatch Team
  Right. So yeah, that was my initial suggestion. He pushed back up the way I charged me. don't know if I want to pay a fee as their way to like speak to someone who knows this stuff more directly in Canada.  I look for many to do some research on that. I'm not sure. Maybe I said I said speak with them and then they can even if they  know someone in Canada or have their own network, they could probably get the answer for you.

58:04 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Well, that's the thing. can't they'd be advising on the LOI if they didn't have experience, so that's what I don't know.  assuming they do have experience buying a Canadian company before, but if we're heading into like stock sales or asset sales, like he and cross-country boundaries, like he shouldn't want to have legal advice because it is outside of our rent, right?
  ACTION ITEM: Get Barlow Williams legal advice cost for Andrew's Canadian biz purchase - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/278733478?timestamp=3501.9999  So like, why don't you push them to get a cost because they're flat fee, so I'm confused, right? So like how much is the fee for him to have confidence going forward on a deal that's getting more complicated if he's going to be a stock sale?  So get him to find out how much the cost is, right? So it's like you're going to incur costs during this process, you're going to pay legal, you're going to pay a QV.  if, you know, for the confirmation, but like, really not wanting to pay what $500, I think, is their review fee, pre-L-O-Y, for the peace of mind, that's concerning to me.  So, you might just need to, like, hey, why don't you talk to the lawyers first and find out if they can help, and if they want to charge you how much it is, and then we can talk about, like, cost-benefit analysis for you to try to get free advice from somebody versus somebody that's going to be involved in this deal going forward if you're choosing them as your lawyers, and they credit it towards this overall fee, too.  So, what's going on there?

59:44 - AcquiMatch Team
  Okay.

59:47 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay, the weird objections will start coming up, Brian, so we have to kind of, like, you mean, unless they've completely changed their model, I know which case we mean,  to know, right? But if it's Barnall and Williams, I know they do a document review for yellow I think like 500.  They credit that towards the overall fee. You know, so if it's going to be credited against this, you're going under yellow I, you're going to have legal involved in it, then the risk to you at this point is a broken deal cost of 500 to make sure that you have everything dotted and I earn a stock sale in another country.  I know what people do. So if it's like, I don't want to use them, then I know other people, but like now is the time we might start offering costs to make sure that this isn't a good place, right?  And it's going to give investors confidence too. If your preference is to avoid us being able together and go to private debt, what do you think they're going  Yeah, it's getting right. So it's like I had legal Barlow-Lilliams are on the team. They reviewed this or that like how is he going to give investors confidence that once he's got this under L.O.Y.  So just find out why like, like, what is the amount if it's high, then it's like, well, they changed the model.  So like, let's understand that first. Like, how much is it actually to get them to advise you because you're still not under offer?

1:01:33 - AcquiMatch Team
  Okay, good.

1:01:34 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  And it should be credited against their overall beat. So if it's not, we need to know that because it means they've changed their model and they didn't communicate that to us.  And so we're telling people different things and what it is. I don't think it's that. imagine he's, you know, these weird objections when people get scared.  It's real now, right? Right. I don't want to pay someone $500 to like have peace of mind that I'm signing a document for a cross-country deal.  Well, that I'm about to go and try to raise money for why not.

1:02:04 - AcquiMatch Team
  I think the call went pretty well. And after me and him jumped on another call to just talk. I was smiling and he was looked at the nervous.  So that's kind of his natural response after these calls. And he's just like, oh, God, here we go. So that's why we do the calls afterwards.  And he know he doesn't say anything. He says, what do you think? And then I talk and then he pauses and then he starts talking.  there's a bit of like, I think there's an overwhelming dealing going through his head.

1:02:39 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  That's getting realer and realer. The seller's coming to terms with him to sign an L.A.Y.

1:02:43 - AcquiMatch Team
  holy , this is happening, you know? Right.

1:02:47 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  mean, in fact, he hasn't even started the passport renewal process, too. Like, he's putting weird block into it. Like, he should have done that the second his deals started getting hot, you know?  And he didn't. So people will put it. And this, this is good at the teams hearing this because like on the solar side and the fireside people do weird, they don't even realize they're doing it, right?  They'll set little traps for themselves that they don't have to move forward. So, you know, this is a totally random example.  But it was this girl when I lived in Tulum and she was a yoga dance teacher and her vehicle was a bicycle, right?  so that's how she got money. She had to like ride her bike to go teach yoga classes and dance classes and she had this little bicycle and they classed a hundred bucks in where, you know, in Mexico.  And her bike was like the basket was falling off, the chain was like broken and I was like you were literally like for the, and it's like 30 paces, which is like a dollar to get your bike prepared in Mexico.  And I was like, so you're, you're setting a trap for yourself by not having this bicycle. Well, you know, repaired.  so like your bike braking, you're not being able to get to class. It's like not only costing you the revenue of that day, but the trust of the place that your teacher at, the trust of your customers, that sort of thing.  So people don't realize they do this, but they'll lay a little traps for themselves. So this deal has been going on with Andrew for a while.  that passport registration should have been the man we've told him about it. not happened yet, you know, so it's just like a way to.  My interpretation based on Andrew and he probably doesn't even realize that this is the thing or if you brought it to his attention, wouldn't, but it's like, that's one way to delay that the gravity of like, holy , you know, this is a big, big deal bigger than he thought he was going to do.  And there's complications to it with it being in Canada. So like not wanting to pay a little bit of money.  And it's very little in the grand scheme of things, if it's like a $500 review fee to have peace of mind to go under offer on a $4 million.  all from another country.

1:05:06 - AcquiMatch Team
  Yeah, I told them. On phone, find your counter now. Click on it. Put in your passport. So he did that.  We'll see if he actually falls through on it.

1:05:22 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Nice work. Okay. Cool. Anything you need for me on that. I like first let's find out what the cost is before he says no, if the cost is if they're charging in like 5000 and we can look for other options, but I would be really shocked about that.

1:05:37 - AcquiMatch Team
  Yeah, I just want to fill you in on the exactly what happened not not too long, but just the key points.  So the initial line we submitted at a 40% seller 45% seller note. So they were caught. They got a phrase a little bit on the front and I said, listen, this is.  the long-term play, this long-term game, we're open to just hearing everything, your concerns, and what your proposals are. And you can take this time and think about it, it doesn't have to happen on this call.  And then so they agree with that. And so everything that we took, the information we took from him today was just for us to get back together, discuss it, and set up another call or another conversation.  So I'm just going to discuss the points today. So these weren't are negotiated, but they were just soft discussed.  So from a 45% down to 30, from an asset sale to a share sale, from a five-year balloon to a three-year balloon, more clarity on his involvement process, which is, we made it clear under that, let's get these other things done first, and then we'll discuss what the involvement post sale is.  Um, he would like for the, there's a part of the note says you need to hit 15% growth in year one, and then again in year two, he said he just wants it to be year one, not year two.

1:07:16 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Oh, that's a risk.

1:07:18 - AcquiMatch Team
  Right. We discussed that. We said we feel pretty confident in pushing back on that. Yeah. Yeah. And he says he thinks his, his, his working capital is about 80 K.  He's like, I'm not sure how that works. I said, just plain undoing, undo diligence almost, and we'll make sure that's a fair number for everybody.  He confirmed that SDE is accurate that we're using, and then he asked for no explicitly. 70. Um, and I did a good job of kind of pushing back there and said, need exclusivity.

1:07:55 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So we agreed on 60 days and 70 90. Is there an extension period? It's automatic extension if they're still working on that.

1:08:05 - AcquiMatch Team
  I'll make sure it's done.

1:08:07 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  We have it. There's no way it'll close in 60 days.

1:08:10 - AcquiMatch Team
  Yeah, of course. And I said that. I said, is, I use the dating analogy. was like, this is just to ensure that you're the only one Angie's dating or Angie's the only one you're dating.  Like, we want to know that. We want to know that if we're going to get involved. And he said, yes, I want you guys to know that.  I do have another, I do have other artistic parties that based off this LMI and meeting Andrew, I want it to be Andrew.  So let's do 60 days. It's fine.

1:08:39 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, but Andrew's going to be putting out tens of thousands of dollars between lawyer fees, QV reports, you know.  So I think there needs to be an automatic extension if he's going through it on things. Because it, especially with it being a Canadian business, it is likely that this process will  Wow. Now, if he wants an indication of financing, right, to extend it, that's reasonable. what's his concern with the 60 days?  Like, how are we managing his expectations on how long this takes? And why 60 days? So, I don't know if he can get financing, then, okay, we'll get you like proof of financing with this amount of time, but we're not going to have Andrew spend tens of thousands of dollars on QV reports and, you know, drafting asset purchase agreements, which it will take longer than 60 days.  Like, on Axial, their average time it blows after LOI with 2,500 data points is 130 days. So, obviously, try to do it quicker, but like, we're setting Andrew up for failure and broken deal costs if there's no, like, automatic extension.  But I would find out why the, like, what is the actual objection to the exclusivity period? What does he think is not going to happen?  There's some trust or something there and if it wasn't said then just making them aware there's going to be significant outgoings of costs on Andrews to go through this process.

1:10:18 - AcquiMatch Team
  Okay.

1:10:20 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Did he ask for more price?

1:10:23 - AcquiMatch Team
  No, so I'm buying the purchase price.

1:10:27 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay so Andrews getting his prize so the seller's asking for terms so if he was asking for more money and his terms so you know stock sale would again with Canadian companies like Andrew might be able to turn it into I don't know how that works with deal depreciation or deal cost appreciation and amortization of goodwill when it's cross-country like so that will  to be something that he gets advice on and I don't think he's going to get free advice on that, nor should he.

1:11:06 - AcquiMatch Team
  He's going to need some new advice and throughout this entire process, right?

1:11:12 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Like, he's bought into this deal, lawyers should know someone or be able to advise on themselves. And then once he understands the implications, then he can plug that into the model so you is to make sure that the business can stand on its own two feet without the seller one year isn't enough.  So I would know way on the performance note. And maybe it's sustaining a 15, like maybe it's sustaining that number in your two.  So it's like 15% growth your one and then zero your two. So it just has to sustain it without him there is something that you can potentially think about.  But the whole point of second year is to see if it survives without the owner since he's the face of the business.  That is one of the biggest, biggest risks. And if I were Andrew, if he's asking for a 30% seller note, I would get the entire 30% performance based.  Because I think there was like 10, 5, 15, like 5% equity, 15, straight up seller note, then the other 25 was performance based.  But I would just shift it all to performance based or like whatever it was, and like if he's knocking down the total seller amount, like just put it all into performance based.  Have him mark that up and then we can look at it before he goes back to it. But he needs to get like actual expert answers on the on the implications of putting a stock sound Canada and moving it to the US.

1:12:58 - AcquiMatch Team
  So what you mentioned before you said some warranties and those kind of things. Those are things that could change, right?  Because like our model is based, the model that we have built is based, if you change it to stock sale, that's a US stock sale.  So I don't know if it is though, because the company is in Canada. Oh, I mean, what we have, if you modeled out what we have, it would sell what it would be like for a US stock sale, right?  So we would still need to find out how that would differ from this Canadian that's selling.

1:13:29 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  That's what I'm saying, like he needs to speak to an expert. They can tell like it might be that you can still treat it as an asset, so if you're buying a Canadian business and moving it to the US.  So it might be no hit on him in terms of that amortization of goodwill and appreciation of real expenses, which are the two things that get affected when you do a stock sale.  So that's why somebody that knows what they're doing with the Canadian purchase. needs to tell him that. So then we can put that in the model, but we need to know what it is.  And the model doesn't account for Canadian sales. And I don't want us advising or not, because it's not responsible for our side to advise on something we don't know.

1:14:14 - AcquiMatch Team
  Yep. Okay. Okay. think that's good on that. Um, Cm, it's just really a sort of talking point that's just to make you aware of like what we kind of need to discuss is how much to pay those family members during that transitional period.  But it's just pretty much a reminder.

1:14:38 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Well, the spreadsheet that he filled out, I tagged Kate in it, is that the one interesting Yes.

1:14:49 - AcquiMatch Team
  Um, yeah. Um, and then just JB, JB, the, would recall Jason's putting together an LOI in a short video for that business team got on me.  then the last one is I was helping Gill with the modeling and then we discussed it remember the performance base and I sent him a note today and then he was responding saying it's not lining up and I looked at the sheet and I can't really see why it might not be lining up.  And so I just wanted to wrap up.

1:15:32 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Can you have him like do a screen share and show me and send me the model so that I can look at it?  Because if he's just doing a voice note and not like showing me the cells that he's talking about what he's saying it's really hard.
  ACTION ITEM: Teach Gill Slack screen sharing; ensure he shows model issue to Athena/Ryan - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/278733478?timestamp=4546.9999  Unfortunately I won't be able to jump on a call with him and I think we need to train him on how to do this anyway because he likes a lot of calls so if we can get him figuring out the screen share.  Anka can you jump in and help Gill like. just give him a quick tutorial on how to screen share on Slack.  And then, was the most recent thing, him saying, like, I don't know what's going on here. You guys had another call after it.

1:16:21 - AcquiMatch Team
  I don't know what's going on. No, we haven't got call. So we had it, we told him that last night, then he needed me to talk and I sent him a note this morning, showing him how to use that.  Then he responded back and said, I got it, but this other thing is not lining up.

1:16:36 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  I don't know why. Okay. Can you jump in? Show him how to do the screen sharing and say, Hey, Gil, can you please do a screen share and show Athena and Ryan what you're seeing and send the model so that they can feed back on it?

1:16:54 - Anke Badenhorst
  And then once he actually shows up,

1:17:00 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  what he's seeing, then I can look at it and see what he's talking about. He might have done something weird with the settings or like the model, the scenarios are different, so I need to see what he's seeing first, and then what he's talking about, because all the performance things, as long as he's using the most recent model, should be calculating fine.  So this version 3, it should be calculating properly. So let's push clients to use video and like Anka, like maybe forward it to Anka in the situations where like a little video tutorial would be helpful for clients for them to like use those functions, but I think it's better for all of us if they're using voice notes or doing screen shares so that we can feedback in the moment instead of trying to like push it to a call, if it's not necessarily like a whole call thing to do.
  ACTION ITEM: Alert Athena re Gill's screen share; create Notion task w/ model file - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/278733478?timestamp=4664.9999  And then Kate, keep an eye on when Gil does that and then notify me. so that I can dive in and review it helpful if you put it in a notion task along with the file to whatever he's working on so that and then just let me know that Gil's come back to it so that I can review it and see what's going on there.

1:18:15 - Kate Kelley
  Perfect.

1:18:16 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Sweet. Look at that. All this teamwork, it's exciting. Awesome. Great work, Ryan. Super exciting about Andrew. just hope he doesn't get scared and but he's pushing through it you know as long as we keep like you can do this like you've got this but you're so it's a great business for him and I'm excited once he gets it under L.I.  introduced him to the finance providers too so it was very it was more confident today on the call it was after they got nervous about my call in front of the seller facing me to see a scholar.  Yeah because it went it went his way so now it's like oh . I mean, you know, whereas before it was like, so yeah, that's, that's when people get scared when they get what they want.

1:19:06 - AcquiMatch Team
  Yeah. And yeah, tables have turned.

1:19:13 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  And what?

1:19:15 - AcquiMatch Team
  I said the tables have turned.

1:19:17 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, nice. Good work on those. Okay, cool. I'm glad we had this time already scheduled and everybody's calendars for today.  So thanks for staying late. is good stuff. Be thinking about, you know, now that we've got that agenda populating, like if there's things that y'all want to talk about, or that would be good for Athena time, like David and Luke also, you know, or I know, you know, doesn't come on these calls, like the responses, those sorts of things, like use that agenda to drop it in there, and then we can talk about it.  It's going to be helping facilitate that too, and just reminding everybody to do that. No, because they're already set up automatic reminders.  So. Cool. Nice work, everyone, and great work on the stats so far. It's awesome. know that's like a lot of teamwork to get it to that point to be able to get that many write-ups out.  So, I'm just seeing them fly and I'm like, oh my God, the clients must be like, well, that's what I'm going to get to for them to be like, come down.  So, good stuff.

1:20:21 - Anke Badenhorst
  All right, that's Enjoy the rest of your evening.

1:20:27 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Tomorrow is my favorite day.

1:20:29 - Kate Kelley
  I'll see you all or team meeting and Kate's first team meeting. So, she's to get a feeling.

1:20:35 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So, starting about what your wins are for the week, Kate, we're going to ask you that. Lots of good stuff happening, lots of Eloise flying.  So hopefully we get some good news on some of those that have been submitted soon. And we'll see you all tomorrow.

1:20:51 - Luke Gillespie
  Thanks.

1:20:52 - David R
  Thank you. Bye guys. Bye. Bye.
