# AcquiMatch Buyers Club - 19/12/24

[00:00:00] 



**Joe:** Hey Joe! Hi. How's it going? All right, and you? Am I the only one on? 

**Athena:** You might be, so it's going to be a very like many on one session for you. If no one else turns up today spotlight session. How are you doing? 

**Joe:** Oh, wonderful. I'm fine, um, I'm, uh, busting busy, busy stuff. 

**Athena:** Just wrapping up for the end of the year.

**Joe:** Uh, yeah, kind of. And kind of deals never stop. So, it's a good thing. Yeah. 

**Athena:** Amazing. Hey, Kevin. Just 

**Kevin:** been running hot today. Hey, guys. 

**Athena:** How's it going? 

**Kevin:** Hello. 

**Athena:** Going 

**Ryan:** well. Amazing. You coming from [00:01:00] the new office, Kevin? 

**Kevin:** I am, actually. Yeah. Alright. Yeah. 

**Athena:** How's the transition going? 

**Kevin:** Going pretty well. Yeah, I apologize for being a few minutes late.

I was supposed to have a call. It's fairly certain it's not happening. If I have to drop off, it's because Turns out 

**Athena:** that's all good. We've got Joe here, too. I think Andrew might be there somewhere. So smaller groups, lots of firepower from the team, but I think it will still be good to just have a discussion and see what challenges everybody's facing.

Uh, we've done a lot of learning sessions in the last couple of weeks, and if there's any questions that came up with that, or blockages or challenges in terms of, like, next steps. Um, and then I wanted to leave you all with a tool that, um, has been incredibly powerful tool [00:02:00] in my life and is really good around this time of year to use it to just help calibrate, um, how all of this fits into your life and it's a helpful decision making tool.

So I'll hold off on that, but, you know, just opening it up anything and everything's cool to talk about. But are there any things that. You're feeling challenged by, and as part of the process right now, or personally feeling challenge moving forward on things

and I'm, I'm opening this up to, uh, Joe or Kevin, or I think Andrew and Steve might be here as well. There's Steve. So, yeah, if anybody wants to be brave and go 1st, what challenges are you facing? 

**Joe:** Yeah, I'll go here. Athena and, you know, we, we talked a little bit last night. Uh, I did actually call the packaging company deal.

I finally got ahold of the [00:03:00] broker only in the past hour, really. And he said it's still out there and listed multiple offers. A few of them are strategic, meaning more or less businesses or some sort of Non private individual buyer, of course, and he said a couple private offers and so it sounds like they're not in a rush They're still taking offers over the next couple a few weeks but I bring that up because it's it seems to be a common thing I keep running into is Uh, deeper pockets, cash purchases at a rover asking price.

Um, and it's, it's probably, it's a little overwhelming feeling to be competing against businesses or something close to private equity where they come in with strong numbers, strong offers, uh, compared to a private buyer like me. 

**Athena:** Yeah, it, [00:04:00] um, you know, the strategics are coming down smaller and smaller, which is unfortunate.

But also there's sometimes an element of the broker making you feel like there's buyers out there. So if they're leaving it open, then it means that no one like was a direct hit in terms of their offer. They would sign that right away if it was like, yes, we love this. So Some things that strategics do that owners don't necessarily like is Um, they make them stay in the business for another two years.

So, like, they're basically buying the business, but they want the owner to keep running the ship for another 2 years. And a lot of owners don't necessarily want to do that. So we were able to get, um, an off market deal for a client when, like, she had a on her desk from a strategic, but she's like, I don't want to keep working for them for 2 years.

And I was like, well, you should talk to our buyers because they're not going to make you do that. Um, so do you have any color on, I mean, The offers and, like, [00:05:00] specifically on this 1 with what they were offering and why they haven't signed yet. Or did he not did he leave it kind of general and hazy in terms of what offers hazy hazy 

**Joe:** still sounds like the target range is still somewhere in the force.

**Athena:** Right. So that means that they haven't gotten an offer that they like. So that's just be like the broker doing his like salesy thing. 

**Joe:** Like got some 

**Athena:** other offers on the table, blah, blah, blah. You know, the only way you find out is by putting an offer in there and in that LOI template that the law firm did, there's an expiry date on it.

And like James David said, he's like, you know, sellers ignore it, but it does create like Some expediency in terms of, like, this is my offer. I'm leaving it open until this point. Um, and it gives you something to, like, check back in and be like, hey, offer expired. Like, where are you guys out with it? Um, so if they haven't signed anything, then I would say that there's terms.

And the other, if [00:06:00] they genuinely got other offers, there's terms in the other offers that they don't like. This is for everybody to your weakness is your strength, you not being a strategic and an investor is your strength. You can lean on the report on the fact. You're going to look after the legacy on the fact.

You're not going to tear this business up for parts, which is strategic. We'll do. They're going to go in there and they're going to get rid of, like, the things that they don't need because they already have the back office support or whatever it is. Right? So, knowing what the strategics and the investors are going to do.

When they get in their owner might not like that owner might not want to work in the business for another 2 years. So you can put your offer out there and and, you know, it's testing the waters. It's like, what is there to lose at this point? If you think that a strategic has put in a more competitive offer, then I'm like, well, why haven't they signed it?

And they're still entertaining offers. 

**Joe:** Well, it's, it's, I'm, I'm indicating more [00:07:00] just at the theme of the strategics coming down to the lower, the lower deals, right? It's I, I, I feel like, because I've been looking at what a year and a half or so, two years approaching. Um, that I feel like it wasn't that case, or at least in my area in Tampa, you know, two years ago, just noted that change if, if indeed, that's really the truth and what brokers are saying, or what's going under contract with otherwise, are these cash, cash kind of deals.

**Athena:** It's hard, it's hard to gauge, like, what, like. If that was genuinely the case, they would have signed it. So, sometimes the brokers will just tell you that to try to generate interest or drive the offer up or, you know, salesmanship to like their salesman. Um, but again, I, I'm, I'm not discouraged by the fact that they're strategic out there.

I'm encouraged because I know that [00:08:00] owners didn't build their business for 20 years to hand it over to somebody. To rip it apart. And fire half their team and not look after the customers or keep them working for another two years. And like their payout being dependent on that. That's what those earnouts are.

Like they have to stay in the business and earn their, their, you know, whereas like someone like you, it's like they get most of it at close and you probably want like a six month transition period with them. And you're going to look after their team and you're going to make sure that nobody leaves and everybody's looked after.

Like we can win on those things that, that you. You know, perceive as a weakness by developing those relationships with the sellers. And oftentimes, like, these, these strategics will say all cash, and then they'll get it under offer, and then they'll go for debt because they want to be leveraged. So, like, a lot of times they don't actually produce all cash, they just make an all cash offer.

And then they, they bait and [00:09:00] switch once they get it under. I 

**Ryan:** can confirm. I've heard that multiple times. Um, and as soon as I'm speaking with a seller, and I expressed that this is an individual owner operator, uh, they're immediately excited about that. So they do differentiate between the 2.

**Athena:** One of the things you can do, Joe, is like, just do a brain dump of all the reasons why you're going to be an amazing owner, like remind yourself why you're better than a strategic and an investor. And that sounds, but like, that'll show in your confidence too. And like, when you talk to the owner, a lot of what I like to do is just build such a strong relationship with the owner, even if it's through the broker, like, when you talk to them, like, what's important to you?

Like, Hey, I know, like, investors are coming in, like, Hey, How do you feel about them, like, getting rid of your team or, you know, selling your business again in three years, you know, like, you can create the doubt just in the [00:10:00] questions that you asked there. So, um, it's it's a reality. But again, like, I always, I always view.

Weaknesses and strengths. Like, how can you turn those into strengths and show your point of difference and use your skillset, which is, you know, developing relationship sales, that sort of thing, like turn that on and also the brain dump thing and everybody can do this. Like, why are you going to be an amazing owner of that business?

Like, what do you bring to the table? What are the qualities that like, you know, why are you doing this? And then you can convey that, which a lot of times, as long as the offers like in the range, they'll take a little bit less money to go with someone like you. Kevin, didn't you guys have an experience like that because of the relationship you built?

**Kevin:** Yeah, I mean, what, so what, what did you say that, say that again? Like, what do you mean specifically? 

**Athena:** Like, uh, was it, was it you guys that there was another offer? There was a [00:11:00] little bit more, but they wanted to work with you because of who you were. 

**Kevin:** So in one of the other ones that we were exploring, there was.

Um, the one that we ended up closing on that, yeah, a little bit, a little bit of a different situation. Um, I think they, they had previously gotten offers that were higher than what we, than what we put in, but, um, that ultimately it's fallen apart. Before we got into the mix with them.

**Athena:** That's right. And they ended up walking away from it because there was too many variables that didn't feel good for them, 

**Kevin:** which I think is actually something that ends up happening a lot, especially when the broker is just pushing the high cash offer ones. Um, like, we, we had a broker reach back out to us a month or so ago saying that a deal that they had turned us down and accepted the cash offer on.

Right. It actually has gone [00:12:00] back to market. So they were, they were wanting to know if we were interested, but, um, you know, we had already kind of. Pivoted and moved on at that point.

**Athena:** Yeah, the, so the, the kind of backstory there was the, the business, one of the businesses that, um, Kevin closed on owners were in under offer with some other buyers, but the other buyers, like there was just things that kept adding up and they were kind of treating it like an investment, you know, and they were going to put an operator in and dah, dah, dah, dah, dah.

And the owners like over time while they were under offer, they're like, this isn't right. This isn't who we want to hand over. So even if they, and then the point that you just made about, we've seen this a lot that the deals that like go under offer, they come back online because once, once the owner gets down the track a little bit, and they realize what they're going to do, they don't like it, you know, and they want out and, [00:13:00] or the people, the strategics, what they'll often do is they'll, they'll just fire an offer out to get it under exclusivity.

You know, so that they, they kind of corner off anybody else going after it, they'll fire off the offer really quick. They've got an exclusivity and they'll be like, I don't like this and they'll toss it back. So, I guess the learning from that is like, or 

**Ryan:** like, on top of that, like, they will do that. But on top of that, it's strategic in the sense is that they want to capture the seller.

And then beat him down in due diligence to get the price that they really want and see if they actually will bite on that. And that's why a lot of people don't like working with them, is because that's their, that's their play.

**Athena:** You're a person of integrity, so what you're offering is what you intend on paying. A lot of them don't operate that way. They'll, they'll put an offer in asking all cash because they know that we'll get it under exclusivity. And then like, we're just going to go for [00:14:00] a little debt that happened on the 8 million dollar deal that I went after.

And I lost it to a strategic and they offered all cash and then they got it and they offered a super quick close. That was 1 of the other sticking points on my offer was that I, I suggested a 90 day, uh, Diligence period, which is totally standard. And these other people are like, oh, yeah, we'll get in there in 45 days.

I'll cash and broker saw dollar signs very quickly. Remember brokers are like, starting right? Like, they, their structure is that they only get paid on the close. So, if they've been working a deal for every year, they want to get paid. So they often just go for the person that looks like, we'll give them the most money the quickest.

Um, and so I'll cash. Offers, that's what they'll push because they think they're going to get paid quicker that way. But on my deal, they ended up, I think it was like 7, 8 months. It took to close. And after they got under exclusivity, they're like, we're just going to go for a little debt. And then the [00:15:00] whole thing ended up being debt.

It was never an all cash offer. I

**Steve:** have a question. So do you ever, uh, I guess, uh, for the folks who have been through this, uh, Athena, Ryan, et cetera, uh, Kevin, I see, uh, when you get that situation and you know, that they're going to, you know, get that exclusive, you know, by the strategic with the cash offer, do you ever start to kind of pre sell what they might expect, or you've seen this before?

And so, so when it does happen, your credibility just, you know, Skyrockets at that point. Do you ever do you ever do that? Or is just best to let it play out? 

**Athena:** Yeah. I mean, it's a it's it's a good point. Steven. That's kind of what I was alluding to. I think in Joe's situation, Joe, they're keeping the the seller kind of close, right?

The brokers trying to not let you have a lot of interactions with them 

**Joe:** for protecting them pretty heavily. 

**Athena:** And [00:16:00] have you been able to have conversations at all? 

**Joe:** Yeah, I had a call with it was both of them. But, uh, that was, that's been a while. 

**Athena:** Yeah. 

**Joe:** It was one call and it was probably over an hour. 

**Athena:** So, um, what I'll typically do if the broker's, like, not wanting to give you access, it might be because they're worried that you're going to, like, discuss the actual deal.

So you can, you can say, like, I'd love to have another conversation with the seller. Um, you know, I know that the specifics of the deal need to go through you, so that's not really what I want to discuss, you know. Like, what, what would be your objection to be having another conversation with them? And then on that call, and I know exactly what I'm doing, but I play a little bit dumb and I'm like, gosh, like, you know, so I, I think I described this on 1 of our calls before, but, you know, I knew that there was a ton of offers on the table and I knew a ton of them are coming from, like, [00:17:00] strategics and private equity and, you know, And I was like, gosh, this is like really overwhelming, right?

Like, I bet you get on these calls and they're just like ripping into your business and the numbers and they're like, yeah, you know, so it's like, you can, you can play some kind of similar to what you're saying, Steve is like, when you get on the call with them, you can just. It feels like it's just conversation, you know, and just, like, warming up to the to the conversation and, like, actually avoiding those hard hitting questions and not treating them like an investor and, like, just some commodity that they're trying to analyze, you know, um, treating them like a human and really understanding them and also sympathizing them like, man, this must be really stressful for you and all these numbers and all this structuring and stuff like, um, Yeah, I've heard of like private equity that, you know, they, they try to keep the owner in the business for like 2 years, you know, just like drop those little things like, yeah, I, you know, [00:18:00] I, I obviously not an investor like that, but I've heard of, you know, these crazy things where they get it under offer and then they like drag out the due diligence for a long time and.

You know, just so you can mention those things in that way. And it feels like just rapport building and conversation building. But then you plant that seed and then then when those offers come through, they're going to start thinking about that and being like, well, Steve or Joe is the guy that lives down the road for me that I like, you know, that I can see them in my business.

So that's what you're really trying to do. And that was, you know, the point of that whole like seller rapport building is when you think of it like a relationship, you definitely want to kind of like, I was the competition in that way too, but planting seeds of doubt. And it's like, yeah, they show up with cash, but man.

They lock in and make it, you know, keep working in the business for 2 years. Like that sucks.

Um, so that's 1 way I might play it if you if you can get access to the [00:19:00] seller and just try to develop a little bit more rapport because that's what's going to give you the leading edge is if they like you and they see you in the business and they feel understood by you. 

**Steve:** Hey, Joe, I had a second question.

Uh, just more of a curious question. When you say their strategics in Tampa are you're running into a lot more today than you did a year and a half ago. Um, are they, I don't know your deal box. So is it, are there specific industries you see them targeting more so than not? Or, um, is it just across the board?

**Joe:** You know, uh, I should caveat with what I said with, you know, I'm also, I guess I'd say I'm looking at probably Better, cleaner deals being with AquaMatch at this point versus the ones that I was going at on my own. The year and a half or two ago. So maybe hard to compare the two. Um, but let's say like this one, I'm going to a little [00:20:00] bit of a, you know, out of, I don't wanna say my comfort zone, but it's, you know, a higher price point, higher asking price deal.

Um, so. I guess, I guess maybe it's a, it's a matter of some of my perception and then not what's actually happening. And at least with the broker, like, like we've been talking about, the, the brokers are going to say that they have these strategics in there or, uh, maybe a broker gets back to me and says, Hey, the seller is about to accept the, uh, a cash only LOI this week.

You know, thanks for playing sort of thing. So, it's, uh, I'm just, I guess I'm just noticing it a little bit more. And probably based on the price points and the industries I'm looking at. I'm looking, I'm looking at a lot of, uh, you know, distributor to maybe blue collar and skilled labor, uh, skilled worker type, uh, businesses for the most part.

**Steve:** Yeah, so I'll segue if you want being into. Okay. You know, what's [00:21:00] what challenges facing. 

**Athena:** Yeah, just 1 more point on Joe. Um, before we move on, but Joe, something else that, like, time kills all deals. Right so the quicker that we can move. And get it under exclusivity, it eliminates those possibilities for those other folks to come in the mix.

So, um, you know, the team picks up on these pretty rapidly when they come on the market. So, the quicker that you can get the offer together and out. You know, and you get quicker every time and I think Kevin can attest to this, like, you know, the 1st 1 or 2, it's like, you take a really long time because you're learning the process.

But when you, when you make more offers, and it's just like, I know exactly what to do. I get it out. So, the quicker you can. Do that and get those out, then you also eliminate the possibilities of the, you know, additional people coming to to like, because they might have [00:22:00] caught on it onto it later. Um, so I still think I still think, like, honestly, I'm like, if they genuinely were getting an offer that was like, a home run, they wouldn't even be saying that they'd be like, it's signed.

So he's probably just trying to drum up an offer and try to drive up your price and the offer by making you think that, you know, there's, there's a possibility that the deal is going to go under offer all cash, you know, cause it makes you make a more competitive offer that way. So I think you should do, like we talked about yesterday, get an offer out where you're comfortable with it, put it out there, see if they counter, and then you can go from there because at least if it's a no, but we're still open to discussing.

And it's like, Cool. Let's see what we can do. Yeah. Yeah. But it gives you an opportunity to like, just put together another offer, get better at that process, get quicker at that process. Um, so, you know, either they might, they might be like, yeah, we will, we'll sign this now. [00:23:00] Cause they don't have other offers out there.

And if it's been on the market this long, I'm like, well, somebody would have snatched it up if that was genuinely the case. Um, or the owner doesn't want that. An investor, like, they already had a strategic look at this and it fell out so that that might have, like, burned the owner. So, actually, they do want someone like you.

Um, the only way to find out, I think, is just to take the next step and, you know, put an offer out there.

And then on future ones, just, you know, see if you can move quicker and, um, Kevin, I'll get back to you on your experience there, but I know that was something that we've talked about a lot in terms of timeliness and then Steve, I'll come back to you after Kevin feeds in here. 

**Kevin:** Yeah, I mean, I think, um, You know, when we, when we first started working with Athena, the first deal that we got, we went back and forth on for several, several weeks.

I mean, it's kind of hard to remember at this point, but it might, it [00:24:00] was probably a little over a month, maybe a month and a half. And it was just trying to figure out if it was the right fit. Um, the business that we ended up acquiring. We, we did a lot of the negotiating upfront, but we indicated that we were like, we're going to submit an offer.

We just want to hire up the details. And luckily that the sellers and the broker were kind of all on board with that approach. And so at that point it was as good as having something exclusive, albeit they think we still could have lost it. Somebody could have swooped in on us. The, the deal that we are in the process of closing now, my wife and I, um, we I mean, we, Ryan put it in front of us and I think we had an offer to them within a week and a half.

We, you know, we, we turned it around. We, we made the offer. We knew what we were wanting to negotiate and then we, we negotiated some of the details, you know, after, after getting exclusivity. So the deal that [00:25:00] we did close on, um, I think we were introduced to that deal in April and it took us April to October to close.

The, the deal that we are, which knock on wood, but we're, we're waiting for the closed date to be announced. Um, we've been, I mean, it's, it's two months, maybe, you know, from, from start to finish. I mean, it's, it's, it's been a really quick, quick process, three months, maybe. Yeah, I, I definitely think that like every, every time we hit a new part of the process, it, we kind of experienced that.

Like, I think it's really natural. Um, you know, But every after we've done it once, we got really fast with it the next time. And I definitely think that moving quickly and then navigating based off the responses is probably a pretty good way to go.[00:26:00] 

**Athena:** Great insight Kevin. Does that help you unlock the next step Joe? 

**Joe:** Yeah, a lot more clarity. Thank you. 

**Athena:** No worries. Um, and if y'all are ever running into lender challenges, Kevin and Lindsay are experts. I think they've talked to seven different lenders to get the deal closed that they closed on and, and like the process of, I mean, Kevin, you can speak to this, but something that like Lindsay said that that's just stuck with me.

She's like, I've never had to defend something I wanted to purchase so hard before. So it's normal. 

**Kevin:** Yeah, I mean, that, that was the next like big, like, just like, um, eye opener was like, okay, cool. We, we got the sellers, you know, we, they accepted our offer and then it was the process of getting a lender because it's, it's almost the same thing.

Like they're trying to see if they think that you're going to be able to [00:27:00] close as much as you're trying to make sure that this lender is going to be able to get the deal done for you. So yeah, we, we went through seven different lenders before we got to the one that we were able to close with. And then the actual closing process is just absolute chaos.

But, yeah, it got a little smoother this time. 

**Athena:** I was going to ask, does it get any better the second time around? . 

**Kevin:** Um, I, well, so I think what's so chaotic about it is that ev literally every bank is different. And, and so like the, the challenge is trying to parse out what is bank specific and what's SBA A specific, or what's, you know, like if you're gonna do an SBA loan, what's SBA specific, um, or you know, what, what banks tell you is, is a hard and test rule.

And then if you press 'em hard enough, they'll tell you that they have flexibility. So I, I, I just think that it's, it's. It's it's so surreal that you have to know exactly what you're trying to ask for certain lenders other lenders They're [00:28:00] they're partners with you. So I mean just be your best advocate You know, 

**Athena:** but be prepared that it's going to be an absolute, like, uphill battle to get lending, even if the business is solid.

And so are you too. Right? So, I think that's just preparing you for that. What comes next after offer? I was like, you thought the challenge is over getting under offer, but actually the lending road show and getting a commitment letter is is. You know, and that's the next block before you even get to do the due diligence really is like, can a lender get comfortable enough with this to lend?

**Kevin:** But selling yourself to a lender makes a huge difference. It really does. 

**Athena:** Yeah, I'd love to bring the 2 of you on next year and, like, do a little bit more of a deep dive into, you know, the SBA and getting the best out of the process and stuff, because you guys had more experience than most, I think, in, like, [00:29:00] navigating that.

It's been, 

**Kevin:** it's been really fun. Um, we used, we're using 2 different banks. Um, I really should not be speaking about the second deal as if it's already closed because, you know, it's close. We're on the goal line, but it's not there yet. Um, but we're using a different lender for that deal than we did for the first deal.

Came with its own set of challenges. Like, it was, you know, the first blender that we used, the closing process was chaos from the start to finish. Um, this one, they were really organized up front, but they've literally told us within the last two days that, like, we could close any day. And it's like, whoa, I didn't think we were that close.

Like, that's news to me. So, yeah, it's exciting, but it's also, it's its own set of chaos. 

**Athena:** Amazing. Thanks, Kevin. Um, Steve, how can we help? What would you like to chat about? 

**Steve:** [00:30:00] No, I mean, you've kind of started down that road. Um, yeah, number one, I think you said, what's your biggest obstacle? Uh, you're looking at the biggest obstacle right here.

Uh, you know, it's that comfort level that Kevin was just talking about is not moving fast enough. And although we jumped on at the wrap up of Tuesday's call, we have to watch the L. O. I. We're so bummed. We missed it because it was so excited about to see it. And actually actually had a conversation with Ryan after that.

But the comfort level of knowing, okay, you can move quicker and still not be boxed in is a big deal. So, you know, that's number one is that speed and anticipating already each step is going to be a whole learning experience. And you get kind of faster at step one and two, then step three is going to drag.

Then the next time, step one, two, three, you're good until step four. So it's just getting the reps in and, you know, that, that, um, That's one thing. The other area. [00:31:00] Um, and just from an observation, because Joe said it, um, is that we realized that a lot of in our deal box, we're finding a lot of jobs for sale.

Uh, we're, you know, the person leaves the company. There is no company. Uh, so we're, we're, you know, and what Joe said, he's starting to look at a deal that's bigger, uh, a little bit outside of the normal deal box. Yeah, we're starting to think the same way as we got to look a little bit bigger to get an actual business and not just somebody's job.

**Athena:** Yeah. So something to think about with that is that, um, when we look at businesses. If we're just looking at the write up, or, like, what the broker saying that we don't necessarily get the full picture. So, if the only thing that's, that's making you hesitate is the owner's involvement in the business. And I would, I would, you know, give yourself the opportunity to take the next step.

Speak to the owner. And kind of explore some of [00:32:00] those concerns, so we want to kind of like, act like scientists through this process. And it's like, I have a hypothesis that the business cannot stand up without the owner. Right? And the owner is working like crazy hours. I need to confirm that. And often what we find, especially with, um.

You know, like the boomer generation in particular is their whole identity is wrapped up in their business. They can't imagine themselves doing anything but working. So things that they shouldn't be doing. They are right because it's just. Who they are, like, I need to do the books I need to answer the phones.

I need to, you know, look at all the emails, like. So, you kind of want to at least give yourself the opportunity to have a conversation with the owner and get an overview of, like, what they're doing. And it's like, some of this stuff could genuinely be outsourced for not a lot of money, freeing up your time to focus on, like, the strategy or the growth of the business or just get that time back.

Um, so they're not necessarily creating those [00:33:00] operational efficiencies. So you kind of need to see like, well, what tasks are actually against that person's name before I say like, oh, the business doesn't work without them. Because if it's. Accounting and bookkeeping and payroll and like, that's not something that's exclusive and only the owner can do those sorts of tasks.

So I'd say, um, have a look at what they're doing. And like, what could you outsource that for? Like, a lot of that stuff, you don't necessarily even need local help for it. You could get amazing. You know, remote team members that support you and help you with the admin side of things and the bookkeeping and then it frees up your time, or it's just stuff that you don't necessarily need to do.

Um, so I wouldn't eliminate a business solely on. Oh, it looks like the owner works a lot before we've had a chance to explore that. Um, so I don't know how far you got in that conversation, but that's something that I'm always looking at. It's like. Is this somebody that just likes working and they're spending all their time there because they, they don't [00:34:00] know what else to do with themselves.

They don't have any hobbies. You know, it's like, that is their life is the business. And is there an opportunity to, like, optimize that when you take it over? Or is it genuinely like the house is on fire? And they're the only firefighter. They're the only one that could put, you know, that's qualified to be a firefighter.

And then, and then it's, then it's a different story. But you, you get quicker at discerning, um, things the more you, the further you get. So don't hold up, like, Give yourself the opportunity to get this up further because, like, you just said, you know, 1 takes a long time until you've done it enough times.

And then that's quick. And then you get held up on 2, et cetera, et cetera. So the owner conversations in themselves are such great reps to get just on, like, exploratory questions, building rapport, you know, like, you almost want. You almost want to be the one to do the breaking up, right? So you're like, I think you're great, but this just isn't going to work.

And they're like, no, I really wanted you to buy my business. You kind of want that, you [00:35:00] know, like loved you, loved getting to know you amazing business, but it's, it's not you. It's me. Like, you know what I'm saying? So it's like such a good opportunity to learn. And look under the hood on businesses and figure out what's really going on 

**Polly:** to your point.

I just wanted to, because we were on a call with Ryan last night, and I just brought up a couple, just a couple of quick things. 1 of the businesses we were looking at, um, this gentleman was the business, but he also had people in place that could, uh, to which, you know, could have easily been promoted. And in which case, I mean, let's just say, you know, I was the person going in there and really shadowing him and learning all of this.

I mean, along with bringing along long someone, you know, who could actually step into his place. So, I think there are obviously some creative things that you can do and not just assume that it only has to be him because. These people had been with [00:36:00] him for a long time and knew the business really well.

And secondly, I brought up to, uh, to Ryan last night that I think at least with one deal we were looking at, there was too much emphasis put on what the broker said. And we never, because of the deadline, the timeline, we didn't get to talk with the seller before L. O. I. S. Came into play and it was just kind of a, it, you know, you can't go back and redo it, but you can learn from it.

So I think putting too, too much credence and what the broker was saying and not getting a chance to. Talk with the, the seller, I think maybe we would have gotten a different would have come possibly to a different conclusion that the seller wanted of the owners us being the owners, the buyers, what have you our input more than maybe what the broker was saying instead of, you know, because it was kind of like he was giving us that that feeling that it was more of an investor type of [00:37:00] opportunity and not as much of a hands on.

Owner opportunity so anyway, we never got to really talk with a seller. So I just, you know, you learn from the things that you do. Right. Obviously, and the things that you could do better. So those are the 2 

**Athena:** excellent points. I want to I want to touch on both of them. So the 1st 1. Around there was people that could have been promoted in the business.

It's an amazing point and a really important one to think about too. It's like, if we're looking at a business where the owner's doing everything, does that also mean that the owner's not good at delegating and there's team members there that could be elevated. Kevin, sorry to pull you into this again, but I think you've got real experience with this.

Uh, just, just experiencing that in your business now. 

**Kevin:** Yeah, yeah, yeah, no, for sure. Um, That is, that is what we are currently dealing with. I think, um, one of the struggles that I've been having is, you know, that the whole [00:38:00] idea of, um, learning, listening, and just absorbing it in the first 90 days and not making any, like, major, major changes.

We're approaching 90 days. Um, that's, that's, that's precisely what we were trying to, like, sort through and deal with. And I think that we have a path forward. We've, we've, we've figured it out. We've identified the, the, the people internally that, We're going to, we're going to try to elevate and level up, skill up some of their, their day to day responsibilities.

But yeah, I mean, I think that's where some of the efficiencies that we're finding that we can improve on. 

**Athena:** Um, so. Thank you coming in and, you know, Polly, it's another thing for you to explore when you're talking to the owner. And it's like, well, tell me about the team. You know, like, how long have they been there?

What do they do? And you might realize that the owners, like, the team wants to step up. They're hungry for it, but they haven't been able to because the owner likes doing everything themselves or never learned how to delegate. I mean, that's Being a [00:39:00] leader in itself, like, that's a whole MBA program you need to go through and like delegation and team, you know, it's like, it's a lot, you know, and a lot of business owners don't, we're not taught this in school.

A lot of business owners don't have the time to kind of teach themselves this stuff. Um, Nash, who some of you might know from the CT community. Like he had the situation where a couple of the younger guys like wanted to step up after he had an employee that had been there forever that retired and a younger person in the company wanted to step up and like learn more and take on more too.

So if somebody has the right attitude and mindset in the business and is hungry for it, like, you can, you can train them, you can up level them. So also if there's like a really great. Team that's hungry and motivated, then you can work with that too. So there's a couple of different ways to navigate that.

And then the 2nd point that you made around, we, we listened to the broker and maybe didn't get through to the seller call as a [00:40:00] buyer when you're getting on the broker call, you want to, like, develop a relationship with the broker, get your major concerns covered off. But, you know, typically, I'm trying to just unlock.

Access to the seller. Like that's what I want. So on that column, going into the, the broker call, like, what, what do I need to give this guy in terms of comfort with me, my experience, et cetera, to be able to get through to the seller, because I know I'm going to get so much more from talking to the seller than I am from the broker.

You just get a different, different like experience. And also it's like, is this somebody that I even like, am I going to want to work with them at all? Like, you know, you might go through multiple broker meetings only to get to the seller meeting and be like, this person is an asshole. I don't want to work, you know, like, and then it's like, what was all that for?

So, um, you know, the broker can be really helpful, but I, A lot of them don't necessarily know, you know, they, [00:41:00] they like focused on the numbers and blah, blah, blah. And like, some of them better than others in terms of like, understanding the workload. Some of them think they should be selling you on this, like, investor thing.

And that's what you want rather than like, running the business. So. Um, and I, I'm sure, you know, Ryan and Luke can attest to this, but, like, more often than they're not, they're like, I don't actually know what they do day to day. So then you want to kind of go straight to the seller and, and, like, tell me about your day.

Like, what are the tasks against your name? What are you doing? You know. 

**Polly:** Yeah, I, I think those, yeah, thank you for, for saying all that because I think that's, uh, um, that's super important. And even, you know, just to, just to add real quickly to the broker, I mean, that, that whole thing was around Thanksgiving time, and he even offered up a different broker to speak to, and we could have gotten to the seller quicker, but because we already kind of, like, had that exchange, or I did with, with emails with him and that kind of thing, I felt like, oh, no, we [00:42:00] probably should, you know, Just stick with him since we've had kind of like these conversations and over email and we have one meeting with him.

So it's just, I don't know. It was. Like, I said, you learn, I 

**Athena:** think 1 of the things that, like, so I think that theme going into 2025 that all of us can think about and the team and I are all going to to to put some pressure on all of you is speed. How can we speed things up? Because if we speed things up, we're going to, like, we're going to get these learnings 1 way or another.

Right. So we can extend the timeline for when we get these learnings, or we can learn them quicker. And as long as it's, you know, there, there are checkpoints in which we want you all to check in with us. Like, we'd like to see the offer before it goes over, you know, so we can spot anything that might be an issue.

Uh, but as long as you're not putting earnest money down or signing, like the brokers. Purchase agreement or [00:43:00] like, if you're using our template again, it's like, it's it's non binding. So you can get out of it if you need to. But, like, being quicker, you're going to learn quicker and you're going to get more likelihood of.

Of being able to get the get the deal, because there's, there's a lot of competition out there right now. So. We get it to you all as quick as humanly possible, but, you know, as soon as the write up hits your inbox, like reviewing it that day saying, yes, I want to get on the brokers. Also, they get. Hundreds of people contacting them on every listing that goes up.

They remember the earlier 1. so the earlier you get in there and start developing that relationship with the broker, you end up becoming the front runner just because you got there 1st. And on those broker calls, I'm thinking, like. In my mind, my goal is what's the quickest way for me to get through to the seller.

If the broker is wanting you to speak to them before they allow you to speak to the seller. So what's the quickest way for me to get [00:44:00] through to the source, to develop a relationship, see if I like them, see if this is something that I want to proceed on. And when they like you, then they'll, they'll hold off on those other offers.

We'll be like, what about Steven Polly? I liked them, you know, like, are they putting an offer in, but And when we're doing this in and around our lives. You feel like you're moving fast and I guarantee you're never going to move fast enough. So just lighting that fire under yourself and we're going to do better at trying to light fires under you also.

So just know that's come in. It's, it's, you know, trying to help you all be successful by checking in and reminding you like, Hey, we got to move. We got to move. We got to move because it's, we, we know how hard it is to do this in and around the W2, but it is that, that expediency that's going to help you get closer to closing to 

**Polly:** make sense.

**Athena:** Yeah, good stuff, but you, you, you are getting there and you're taking those learnings and you learn and it gets better every single time. [00:45:00] So the things that held us up in the beginning, once we've done it a couple of times that we're comfortable for it, you know, that's the other thing working against all of you all as you're learning while you're going through the process.

And it's it's a highly competitive, uh, very time sensitive process. So there's a lot of pressure you're going through while you're also learning the process. So, you know, that's that's why we want you to go as far as possible because we know that the further you go, then the quicker you're going to be the next time, the more you're going to learn, um, you know, and you're going to get clearer on what, you know, A good deal looks like for you because you're going to have more of those conversations and be like, oh, you know what?

The owner said that they ran their business this way. I really like that. Like, I'm going to look for that next time or start thinking about and picturing yourself in their shoes. And well, how would I run that? So you start getting in the mindset of being a business owner, even if you don't end up moving on the business.[00:46:00] 

Nice, um, so I want to share this tool, but does anyone else have any challenges or things they wanted to chat through before I pull it up? 

**Andrew:** I've got a quick 1 Athena. I don't know if you guys can hear me. I'm sorry. I'm in my truck. 

**Athena:** Yeah. 

**Andrew:** Okay, cool. Um, I promise I'm not trying to be cool guy here with my sunglasses.

It's very bright. 

**Athena:** It's a good look. 

**Andrew:** Um, I think you've spoke, you guys have spoken to it a lot or spoke about a lot about this. Um, I've caught myself especially being in a smaller market in Oklahoma City where there's not a whole lot the deals that are just like rock star status are gone quickly and there's a lot of deals that kind of hang out for a long time and I am, I am the first one to start reinventing my Deal box.

Um, well, there's just not enough quote unquote inventory. And of course, there's always inventory. If you look and spend the time on, I understand all those [00:47:00] objection handlers, right? But it's it's it's difficult sometimes. And you kind of, you spend a lot of time working through something. And and for me specifically knowing my, my income is Not really W 2, it's very dependent upon me, 

and 

**Andrew:** it's, it's hard when you kind of look through some of these deals like, yeah, this is a good business, and you get down to it, and the SDE after debt is less than what I could make with just putting a little bit more effort into what I'm doing already, and that's, that's a tough thing, which makes it even more a little bit of a, um, A unicorn looking for it feels like you're looking for a unicorn and that that's that's tough.

So it's more of an airing of grievances, I guess, not against anybody here. Just the whole process. And I think, uh, Steve was saying, or everyone was saying, you know, we've all had kind of a life prior to this group and looking and reviewing deals. And I mean, it's been it's been a long learning curve for me.

And there's a little bit of a [00:48:00] exhaustion. With it, which causes you to kind of start rethinking things and changing criteria when we should just be focusing on what that deal box is and sticking to it strong. So, 

**Athena:** yeah, I, um, I applaud you for being honest because I know everybody feels this, right? It's like that fatigue of like, where is it?

I've been searching forever. Where is it? Again, another dating analogy, right? Like, it just to find the one, it can take some time and, um, you know, some things to maybe make you feel better about it is, you know, Um, and it's like the folks that are out there with search funds, they go, they go to, you know, business school, they do MBAs for two years and how to do ETA.

So before they start, so before they start searching, they've gone to business school for two full years to learn how to do this. So you're doing this in and around your other life commitments, which in itself, it's, it's. Frustrating, and it [00:49:00] takes time, so give yourself some, I think, acknowledgement that, you know, this is something that other folks go to business school for a couple of years for, and you're trying to learn it in and around that.

Also with. You know, geographic constraints. It's not that they're not out there. It just extends the timeline. So if you were searching the whole of the US, like, you would, you would definitely find things that fit that deal box. So, um, you know, you have 2 options when you're looking at the deal box and that's like.

The quickest way to get more deal flow is extend the geographic range, but then that changes quality of life, et cetera, et cetera, or extend your timeline and just know that it's out there. It just might take a little bit longer to be the perfect match for you. But, like, compromising on those things, it's going to help you achieve the lifestyle and the life that you want isn't something that we necessarily want to see you do.

I think this is a perfect time of year to just like re center with like [00:50:00] what business ownership is going to help you achieve in life and overall. And that's the exercise that I want to give you all and, and just take some time to like reflect on that, reflect on everything you've learned. You know, it's a lot like you guys are doing financial modeling and putting together LOI templates and doing stuff that's like, That's wild.

It's so cool. Like, think about that. You were doing this a couple years ago, so like you're trying to buy multi million dollar businesses. It's not going to be easy, but you're doing it. That's pretty rad.

So it sounds like a little recharge and like, recentering will help. And then you can hit the ground running in January. And also, you know, the election timing end of year, all of that was just a little bit weird, but we're already seeing, like. Positive signals for deal flow come January and Ryan and the team are already [00:51:00] seeing stuff and people getting excited about it.

And we know that January has a big pickup too. So wouldn't be surprised if we see that across the board for everybody that we're just going to start seeing a lot of really great deals. Now that the years closed out and people know what's happening with the, you know, politics. Interest rates just got cut again yesterday.

Was it right? 

**Ryan:** Yeah. Yesterday. 

**Athena:** Um, so it's out there. Don't give up hope.

Does that help at all? Or is it just. 

**Andrew:** Oh, yeah, no, it does. I, I, I promise it was more of just putting it out into the ether. I'm going to sit here and drink some whiskey and. And get ready to go in January. 

**Athena:** I love it. Awesome. Thanks, Andrew. I'm going to, I'm going to show this tool super quick, uh, for you all.

So, um, it's on your [00:52:00] dashboard. Uh, uncle will drop it in Slack too, but this is, um, I think you all know this about me by now, but I mess around with some woo, you know, like I like woo woo in the right, in the right context. And it can be super helpful. And when I did this exercise a couple of years ago for the first time, it was, and still is one of the most powerful exercises that I've ever done.

So if you think about the way we set goals in life is usually based on external influence, like, Oh, I need to buy a, You know, 5 million dollar business, or I need a hold co, or I need a house worth this much, or I need to earn, you 

know, 

**Athena:** multi 6 figures a year, whatever, like these, these things that we set that are goals for ourselves, but it's not actually attached to how we want to feel and we weren't taught how to set goals based on what would my.

Amazing, happy, content life look like, so this is kind of a visualization exercise. And instead of [00:53:00] attaching to like, Oh, I want to earn this much money, or I want to, you know, achieve this X, Y, Z thing. I want this kind of car. This exercise helps you through a series of questions. Just start thinking about yourself, what your life can look like.

And, you know, Then this part two is like, what is your perfect day look like and you really want to get visceral with it and like, you know, what time are we waking up? Who are we with? How are we spending our time? Where are we? What are we smelling? What are we eating? What are we doing? And then you start getting this picture of like, what?

What would my perfect life look like? What would my perfect day look like? And then we can work back from there. It's like, for me, what came through was, I want a little circus paradise somewhere like near a beach in tropical hot weather. And I want to be able to like, do my silks and have my little dance studio and.[00:54:00] 

Eat fresh fruit every day. And every time I close my eyes, it's like, that's immediately where I'm transported. So then I know, well, you know, I was strong, I was thriving. I read the exercise that I did actually five years ago when I did this for the first time. And it was like, I want to, I want to empower people to live their best lives.

And I was like, Oh my God, like, so it's so crazy how you just program your GPS. And every decision that you make either helps you get there or takes you away from it. But the reason why I think this is a really powerful exercise Is when you're clear on like, well, why am I doing this? What do I want to feel?

Who do I want to be with? For a lot of you, it's going to be like, I want to spend more time with my family. I want to go to the kids activities and spend more time with them. I want to be able to go on trips and I want to have flexibility over my schedule. So what does that feel like? What does it smell like?

What does it taste like? What does a great day in your ideal scenario look like? And then when we're looking at businesses. [00:55:00] You will be able to see, like, is this getting me there? Is it getting me closer? So if you think of, you know, it's one of the reasons why we're so, uh, intentional about the Dealbox.

It's like, we want to program your GPS, but also, if you program your personal GPS on, like, where you want to go in life, what feels good for you. So, Then it helps you get there even quicker. And if you go through this exercise and you want to share it with us even better because then then it helps the team dial in even closer on these businesses that will help you achieve that.

Um, so. That's all I'll say on that. But, um, like I said, I honestly having that vision in your head and you can change it, you know, things, things happen. You meet people, um, things come in and out of your life. So you can always reprogram it, but just having that place that you transport yourself to. And it's like, when a big decision comes up in life, it's like, well, is this helping me get closer there or further [00:56:00] away?

Um, You know, for me, some of the, like, lifestyle choices that I've made in my life around the physical activity that I do and how I take care of my body, it very much fits in with that, like, future me just being able to, like, play on circus toys all day, you know, and, like, be able to, like, have the strength to be able to climb silks and do aerial silks and stuff, so.

Like not taking care of myself now means I, I wouldn't be able to do that and kind of live out my dream. So, and in many ways, I'm able to create those situations for myself. It's like, well, I love being in nature. So I get a house. It's like, right next to a park. So I can go be in neutral all the time or, you know, take, uh, trips a couple of times a year.

So I can be near a beach because it makes me happy. So, um, Um, hopefully that makes sense. Does anyone have any questions on that? Like I said, it's on all your Notion dashboards. Anca will drop it into the Slack channel too, but I love doing this at the end of the year along with a reflection exercise of like, what did you achieve this [00:57:00] year?

You probably did a lot and just brainstorming all of the things that you achieved this year, kind of motivates you to then look ahead and look forward. So when the holidays are closed, You know, when the holidays are around and everything else slow, it gives you an opportunity to kind of reflect and and recenter.

So that when we come January, it's like, yeah, let's let's go and get that new motivation.

I guess we could. Um, well, I was a little late now. I didn't for this. I was going to say, like, share the file in the chat too. So they can grab it right now if they wanted to do it. But the, the, the key to doing it well, is like, you turn off the phone, all notifications, like, no screens, get them all away. And you just.

45 minutes with a notebook and you do it. So you can like, get into that zone, but, um, it is super powerful. I've done this with, uh, you know, when I was business consultant, all my business consulting clients, and, [00:58:00] um, would love to see how it can help you all get even clearer on on your search and how a business fits into that.

So we can dial it in even more as a team.

Awesome. I'm just staring at faces. Okay, cool. Thumbs up. Well, um, we're so excited, uh, about the progress everybody's making. Um, even more excited about what's to come in 2025. Um, wishing you all amazing holidays. And then, you know, the team will be delivering lots of deals to you in January, as well as we're going to keep doing the buyers club, um, Um, so we're actually gonna be doing a QV on the 9th of January.

Uh, just confirmed we're gonna have someone come and talk about Robs and using your retirement accounts towards your SBA down payment and you can do it without having a taxable event. So it's a really [00:59:00] cool tool to know about in your toolkits, having someone that's an expert in that come and talk through that.

Um, we're gonna be having insurance due diligence come through. We're gonna be doing more on SBA financial modeling. All that sort of stuff. So I hope these sessions have been useful because we want to keep them going and keep doing this stuff for you all. And, you know, all we want to do is, is support you to get there quicker and more confidently and into your dream business that can help you achieve your dream life.

So any feedback or things that you want to see, like we're open, we're just trying to improve what we're here to so we can give you all the best service. Um, yeah.

**Andrew:** I think it's been great so far, Athena. I look forward to it. So this is great. 

**Athena:** Same. Thanks, Andrew. 

**Steve:** Yeah, we agree 100%. I'm still struggling with that. I have to put my phone away for 45 minutes, but outside of that, 

**Polly:** I won't have any problem doing that. 

**Athena:** Steve, the, the thing is, [01:00:00] um, when you, when you start doing it, you'll never want your phone on you.

So I have gotten. Such a master at like, you know, no screen time is like I like for me, the ultimate goal, like the ultimate like perfect day for me is like not even having a phone. I'm like, I'm going to have a life where like my team are running things and they just come and check in with me in person.

I don't have to have a phone. Like, I love it so much. So that the. When you start with a little bit and you're like, that was refreshing, and then you might try 24 hours. And the first time I did 24 hours, I thought I was gonna die. And then after that I was like, that was amazing. And then I started doing it once a week and then I started doing it for like weeks at a time.

And then I was like, I never wanna look at my phone again. Be careful because it could be contagious.

**Steve:** let's take a baby step first. 

**Athena:** 45 minutes. Yeah, you can set a timer too so your brain knows when you get your phone back.

Okay. [01:01:00] 

**Polly:** I think I can do it, Athena. I think I can do it. I think I can be like you. I mean, I could easily like step away, step away, step away even more, so. 

**Athena:** We, we never, we never had this, this many, like, things coming at us before. So it's like, you know, for, Somebody to have access to you at any point, you know, and, like, on their time, it's it's like, we feel like we need to be responding to everybody and, like, keeping on top of things.

And then social media on top of that, like, the algorithms are so good at getting you just sucked in and staying there. And you're like, I feel like crap. Why did I just do that? You know? So, 

yeah, 

**Athena:** I mean, y'all know that, like, I like being unrestricted. I don't like anything or anyone controlling me. So I'm like, no phone controls me.

I'm going to master this, you know, um, but I, Aaron, the other side where I'm like, I don't, I don't want to touch my phone. I like, but I do, you know, obviously, um, so it can have its benefits, but it's, it's fun to try it out. Um, [01:02:00] there's a dopamine detox that I did. A couple years ago, and it's like no phones, no like junk food, no like anything that might cause a dopamine hit, no screens, no computers, no TV, nothing, you do it for like over 24 hours, and you can journal and you can listen to music, but that's kind of about, or like, you know, have like little puzzles or things that are just like analog, and it's amazing how your skin is like crawling.

It's And then you realize like, why is my skin crawling that I cannot look at a screen right now? Like that's a problem, you know, and then, and then it makes you almost like, well, I'm going to figure out how to not have that, have that kind of control over me. So powerful, but 45 minutes to start, Steve, I believe in you.

Amazing. Well, uh, excited to hear how it all goes. Joe would love to see you get an offer out before Christmas too. Hopefully we can do [01:03:00] that. 

**Joe:** Yeah, I'm going to try to, uh, before Christmas. Yeah. 

**Athena:** Yeah, let's do it. Hit them with your offer that feels good for you. And like, then you can call them out. Like you really got these other strategies in the back?

So let's, let's see. Now you got to show your money, right?

Awesome. Yes, we're excited. Um, well, happy holidays, everyone. Uh, we're here till the end of the week. We'll be back on Jan 2nd, but the back office team is still working and searching off market has some really interesting stuff. That's percolating for many of you. So, uh, they're still working all of those and we'll see you again in January.

**Polly:** All right, happy holidays. Bye.
