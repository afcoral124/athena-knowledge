  Let's get all these note takers out of here. Let's just shoot Anke a message. I'm not seeing her.

0:33 - Ida Badenhorst
  Is that a Christmas tree in the back?

0:37 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  No, it's just a white tree with lights. Have you not noticed that before?

0:42 - Ida Badenhorst
  No, no, I haven't noticed that before. Everything looks different. Like the board looks on the different side of you.

0:49 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Everything looks different. That is, it is perceptive. Yes, I got finally a desk. I've got one of those like desks that go up and down so I can stand during meetings.  Sitting all day. And then I, hey Anka, your note taker is not here. FYI. Yeah, so I used to have it oriented like around that way, because there's like a little like edge in the corner.  But this desk is like really big. And it goes up and down. So I've like just done it like straight on now and started hanging some stuff.  So this used to be in my bedroom. You guys, I haven't shown you the ridiculous carpet I got. It's a, it's like a black panther in a bunch of roses.  And it's all like bright pink and just ridiculous. it makes me very, I got some big cat energy up in the office because like, all like I have a teenage boy and a like, you know, bodybuilding Texan man out there.  So it's getting like very like masculine out in the common areas. So like, here's like my girly place.

2:00 - Anke Badenhorst
  All the colors in pink.

2:03 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  I see the succulent is still alive. What did you say?

2:07 - Ida Badenhorst
  I see the succulent is still alive.

2:10 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Oh, yeah, yeah.

2:15 - Anke Badenhorst
  Nice.

2:16 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Luke, I'm seeing some daylight. Is it morning there?

2:19 - Luke Gillespie
  Yep. It's 6 a.m. The sun just came up.

2:23 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  goodness.

2:24 - Ida Badenhorst
  Oh, Luke. That's horrible.

2:29 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  How was your vacation, David?

2:31 - David R
  Oh, it was so good. Thank you. I just relaxed a lot. It was amazing.

2:38 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Very cool. How was the handover coming back?

2:41 - David R
  Was it what you needed to dive right in? Yeah, it was perfect. Thank you, guys. Great job. Awesome.

2:46 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Nice work, y'all. That felt good, huh? Less of a lift when we have a plan. Very. Yeah, everybody knows what they're supposed to be doing.  Very cool. Thanks, Anka, for making sure that's all coordinated.

2:59 - Anke Badenhorst
  Yeah. Yeah. No, I love it. I think it's going to work great going forward.

3:03 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, so we did miss you, David. I bet.

3:07 - David R
  Thank you.

3:07 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, we did. Mostly me. Cool. Well, so these deep dive sessions, we're going to try to do them once a week.  We're going to be focusing on off-market for the foreseeable, I think. We're going to need a couple of different sessions to go through this.  So we'll do our normal vetting team agenda like four days a week. So we're not going to do that today.  We're just going to go through the deep dive and kind of this to me is, you know, we're going to be brainstorming and collaborating and assigning like tasks.  So we might not necessarily have all the answers for exactly how we're going to solve this. But we'll delegate work to individual team members to go away, do some research, you know, or, you know, do these tasks.  Do the, you know, things that we assigned to each other, and then we'll come back and figure out the best way forward.  So really appreciate you all, you know, putting what you knew into the process document so far. That illuminated a lot from my side, but I'm curious, how did you all feel once you saw it all in one place?  What was your honest, honest feelings of when you saw it all in one place?

4:28 - Ida Badenhorst
  Well, for me, it felt like we're going to give birth to a baby we're not ready for.

4:34 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Say more on that.

4:37 - Ida Badenhorst
  It just feels like there's so many aspects that I didn't know about. I only focused on my part and seeing everything, I just figured out like, wow, this is like a massive system.  This is actually something big that can turn into something bigger because the document just kept growing.

4:58 - David R
  How about the rest of you?

4:59 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  How about the rest of you?

5:00 - David R
  Yeah, I guess the process is very, it's huge. Like I just do some part of the process, but I know it takes a lot of work for everybody, you know, to basically adjust or make everything work.  So it's really nice to have like a big picture of everything. So we are, you know, aware of what's going on behind the scenes and the different part of the process.  And we all, you know, have the knowledge also to, I don't know, improve part of the process or make it better.  So I think it's really nice to have everything here, just in one place. everything, you know, looks very organized and we are aware of the things that really need to be fixed.

5:46 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah, just the same as everyone, like seeing the whole process and all the parts that I don't participate in.  And it definitely became clear that, as Athena's been saying, there's not always a clear, smooth, clean. And kind of transition or distinction or handover between what goes where and who does what, you know, there's definitely some blurriness in there, some disorganization, some, yeah.  So good to see that and highlight that so we can see where we're going wrong.

6:19 - Anke Badenhorst
  Yeah, I kind of also felt like that when I was going through. So I went through the document after everybody inputted their sections and just like made some few comments and asked for a bit of.  So thank you, everybody, for doing that after I went through and just asked for expansion on some of the topics.  And it kind of felt like I was seeing because I'm reading that book, The Goal, and so I'm visualizing everything that they're teaching me in that book.  And it kind of felt like as I was reading this document, kind of felt like, you know, we've got all of the tables of the manufacturing plan and each table does the cutting and this one does the slicing and this one does the peeling.  But the tables are not connected to each other. So it felt like the potatoes are. Just some of the potatoes are dropping and some are going over and then it's dropping and going over.  And this table doing the peeling doesn't know what the end product is supposed to look like. So everybody is just going on.  It kind of felt like that. So each table, I feel like we've been focusing on getting each table up and running, but there is no throughput.  There's no flow, really like a continuous flow and a continuous goal from front to back. It's just like there's leads and there's expanding and there's mail and there's calls and there's financials, but there was no like flow.  It didn't feel like a good flow between all of the different systems that we tried to set up or that we started setting up.  And it's a good time now for us to just work on this.

7:47 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah. And I would even, I love the potatoes. Like if we're using the analogy of like making French fries, right.  And, and like all the things. It needed to happen in order to make french fries. I would argue, like, oftentimes we're getting apples going through the process, right?  We're not even getting potatoes in.

8:10 - Anke Badenhorst
  So it's like, what?

8:12 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  You didn't want fried apples? Like, what do you mean? You know, and we're getting like rotten apples or, you know, like bad potatoes or we're not, we're not getting the potatoes or, you know, they wanted french fries.  We're making mashed potatoes or something. So, but it was, it was really illuminating for me. I was like, okay, you know, like I've been talking about off market, off market, off market.  And I'm like, if this is what we've been doing, right, then it's no wonder. And so it's not that anybody was doing anything wrong.  You all, you were all at your table doing what you were told at your particular table, you know? What you understood to be the task at that table.  But like Anke said, it's not all connected. And also the processes you were taught. Like you were, some of you were like, even though I had conceived French fries, some of you were taught how to make mashed potatoes.

9:16 - Anke Badenhorst
  Right.

9:17 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Or like you were like, I had a recipe and, and you were told to kind of freestyle it instead of following the recipe as it was conceived.  So imagine like making a McDonald's that way. Right. It was just like, there's all these recipes and processes and then none of it was documented.  And you all were like, okay, we're going to make a McDonald's. But you didn't have a playbook to make the McDonald's.  Right. Or somebody came in and started teaching you how to do a Chick-fil-A instead of a McDonald's, but it was like you had the ingredients and stuff for a McDonald's.  So, um, so this is, this is like, it's going to feel like we're tearing up absolutely everything. And I don't want anybody to think anyone's done anything wrong.  You have not. Like I said. That you've been doing what you've been told to do. I'm going to keep using Anke's analogy because I think it's really strong and easy for us to kind of wrap our heads around.  Like you've been doing what you've been told at your individual table. So what I want us to do is I've kind of thought through some things we can go away with this week.  But I just wanted to go over the kind of like journey. So, you know, what is the journey of an owner coming to work with us?  And why are they working with us? And what does that actually look like? Right. And what do we want as an outcome of that?  And if we start with that, like, what is a good off market owner look like? And what are they, why are they working with us?  And what do we want their experience to be like? Then on these individual tables, we can start going through it.  And I have some thoughts in terms of where I want us to start. And that we have some things in play.  So, you know. Some of it's going to be reactive, like Luke and I are going to do a training tomorrow, and we're just going to have to freestyle some of this stuff while we're working on the overall bigger picture so that we can kind of work the leads that we have, you know, initially.  So it's going to feel a little uncomfortable because we're going to keep doing things kind of as you've been doing them while we're also like revamping some stuff.  But we don't want to break the system we have right now. So then we'll be thinking about like, okay, when do we actually flip this over, right?  And when do we start implementing this stuff? And let's like make sure we have a good overview of everything.  So that's why I was like, don't go and change anything. I'm just making my notes. But like the templates, we're going to have to do a whole copy, rewrite, and actually think about what is the journey, right?  So it's like, is there consistency with the journey throughout? Are we telling them what's coming up and how it's going to work and alleviating concerns as they go through that?  Are we thinking of this like a sales process, you know, because it is like we have. To sell them on the idea of giving us their financials and potentially selling their business to one of our clients.  So even though we're not asking them to give us any money, it's very much a sales process and overcoming those objections, giving them like a preview of what's to come and their understanding of it and making sure that we're getting, you know, the best potatoes for French fries on that table from the very start.  You know, so that by the end, it's just like the best, you know, like, I don't know what your guys' favorites are, but mine are like those like kind of thin, like French fries that are just like crispy on the outside, but they just melt on your mouth inside and like, you know, gourmet.  they might have some like parsley and garlic on them and just amazing with like handmade ketchup. Have you all tried French fries like that?  You know what I'm talking about?

12:55 - Anke Badenhorst
  Yeah, we have bacon and bacon and cheese that they put on. On top of our French fries. Five guys Cajun fries.

13:10 - Ida Badenhorst
  So therein lies the problem, right?

13:12 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Everybody has a different interpretation of what good French fries are. So we also need to define what is our signature French fry.  Because when you go to Five Guys, you know exactly what you're getting.

13:24 - Ida Badenhorst
  When you go to McDonald's, you know exactly what you're getting.

13:26 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  You know, so let's start with what do you want owners to feel like when they work with us? Like, what do you guys personally think that would make you feel good about the owners working with us and an experience with us?

13:56 - Ida Badenhorst
  And there was one owner that responded one time that said... And... Oh, Athena, thank you for the kind words.  And I think that is the response that I'd like, is they would just not, they would feel comfortable with us, not thinking we're a scam.

14:14 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah.

14:16 - Anke Badenhorst
  Yeah, we'll say they're feeling, oh, sorry, David. I would say empathy. They would feel that we were not sharks and we care.  For the business.

14:34 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah. David, what were you going to say?

14:36 - David R
  I was going to say that there are so many brokers out there, you know, like so many people trying to sell your business and trying to put your business in front of many people as possible.  So I think in this case, it would be more like personalized custom experience. It's like, we know you've been through this, probably you haven't been in this process, but if you are, and we know that it's been really hard.  We'veivers It's Brokers, experience with brokers is really hard and we know how it works. So I will say it's more like a personalized experience.  Because we send a lot of messages, like very scammy messages. And I think everybody gets nowadays like so many spam on their email and LinkedIn and all this stuff.  So I would like, if I'm an owner, I would like something more specific to my business. Like, where are you reaching to me?  What are you looking for? Or what is the specific thing that you need from me that is going to, you know, make me action something?  It has to be something very specific to the business.

15:38 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah, just like you guys say, we want it to not be transactional. We want the sellers, the owners to feel like we're doing something to take care of the legacy of their business that they care so much about and work so hard on.  And we want them to feel like we have the right buyer for their business. We want them to feel like they would rather work with us and sell to our buyer.  play to Polk By already We Than work with any other broker or sell to anyone else.

16:03 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, love that. And why do we want them to feel that way?

16:10 - Luke Gillespie
  Because we're matchmakers, not brokers.

16:13 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, and also, what's our overall aim, right? Like, why would we want them to feel like they're VIPs and we're reaching out to them specifically and we want to look after their legacy?

16:26 - Luke Gillespie
  Leave them better than we found them.

16:28 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, it's one of our values, correct?

16:31 - David R
  Yeah, I would say also because they've been working in these businesses like so long time ago. Like, they've been building businesses for many years and we don't want them to feel like it's just one more business.  It's actually, it's your business. We know it's a legacy, you know, we know it's really hard for you to be where you are right now.  So we want to treat you like that. Like, it's actually a really good business that we want to find the right buyer for this specific business.  Because we know you care a lot and you want to keep. Thank you. you. Thank Thank You know, building this legacy for the future.  So I think it's just giving value to the business.

17:07 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah. And what will that do if we do that, then what impact will that have when we make an introduction to one of our clients?

17:22 - Luke Gillespie
  That's our buyers up a leg up already because we've already kind of done some of the groundwork for them.

17:28 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah. And how do you think they're going to interact with our clients?

17:36 - Luke Gillespie
  They're as good people as we are because they already interacted with us.

17:41 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah. Ida and Anke, sounds like you. Anke, do you want to say what you're going to say?

17:45 - Anke Badenhorst
  Much less defensive, right? Their guards are going to be down because they're not going to be thinking, this person just wants to tear up my company because we laid the foundation.

17:56 - Ida Badenhorst
  A bit more eager to talk to our clients.

17:58 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  clients. more clients. Let's take look A bit more of our You Yeah, hi, brokery. And overall, we're setting up the whole transaction for success, right?  We treat them with respect and integrity from the beginning, make them feel like they're not just another number, like we actually care about them, their business, their employees, their customers, and we have a client that's going to be exactly the same way.  Then when we make that introduction, they're excited to talk to them, and it's much more of a collaborative process because they're on that journey together.  They have the same values. They both feel like it's a collaboration rather than a sharky,  negotiation, trying to get one over on the other person.  So not only are we giving the owners a good experience, but we're setting them and our clients up for success by taking them through the process in a way different than what most people are doing, right?  And ultimately, if we're successful at what we do, we're potentially helping a small business stay in the hands of an individual and go to somebody that it's going to change their life, too.  You know, so it's a pretty special interaction that we're helping to facilitate. What are you going to say, Anke?

19:30 - Anke Badenhorst
  I was agreeing with you.

19:33 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah. And so I think it's important. And Anke, maybe this is one of the actions for you is to, before we even get in the handbook, like, let's talk about what our mission is.  You know, what's our mission when it comes to reaching out to these owners? What are we hoping to achieve?  And our mission really is. For them to feel like they're not just another number, they can trust us, that they have a trusted advisor, even though we're not taking a fee from them, it's like a trusted person that's going to make an introduction to somebody that can potentially be the heir to their legacy, right?  When they don't have one already. And from our client's perspective, what do we want our clients to feel when we make these introductions?  What do we want the client's experience to be?

20:33 - Ida Badenhorst
  Like we've already gone through the financials and everything. We're giving them something that they're not going to find later.  There's a red flag or something. They're going to find something that's already been vetted, gone through. It's like a trusted gift.

20:51 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yes, love that. And why off-market versus on-market? What are the benefits to our clients by getting... Being an introduction to an owner that doesn't have a broker involved.

21:06 - Anke Badenhorst
  Less competition.

21:09 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Stay more on that.

21:12 - David R
  So what did you say, Ida?

21:14 - Ida Badenhorst
  It's not that time sensitive.

21:16 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  You can take your time to go through the process. Yeah.

21:19 - David R
  Yeah, more time to interact with the owner, basically, with the seller, basically. To have conversations and, you know, get to know each other better.

21:30 - Anke Badenhorst
  Yeah, so for the clients, what they want to experience is this should be, like, the ultimate gift. Like, the other on-market write-ups are just, like, you know, normal gifts.  But this off-market write-up should be, like, an extra special gift. Because it is extra special. It's rare. It's non-competitive.  It's in a much better position. So they want to experience. I want to say they want to experience kind of like a VIP status when we give them that gift.

22:10 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  How about you, Luke? What do you think?

22:13 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah, I like what Anke says, experiencing the VIP status, feeling special, like when they get this deal that they really got the value that they paid our services for.  Or when they get that off-market deal is when it really hits them like, this is what I paid for.  Like, this is what's going to make me go and tell people to use Aquamatch, know, not getting the fifth on-market write-up from Luke where I'm telling them they have an LOI deadline by the end of the week.  You got to get in there fast, you know, so that's when they're really going to realize the value.

22:44 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Or others, you know, they're excited about it and it's under offer before they even get a chance to talk to the broker and the owners.  Or the broker's gatekeeping them and they can't even talk to the owner. Like, how do you think that feels as a client trying to buy a business knowing?  You're going to potentially take out a loan and put a personal guarantee on millions of dollars. What do you think they feel on-market versus off-market?  Like, how does an off-market make them feel?

23:14 - Anke Badenhorst
  Off-market gives them the time to get comfortable with it.

23:17 - Luke Gillespie
  And on-market, they're very rushed and they never really feel comfortable or feel like they know enough. But off-market will give them the time to think about things and feel comfortable.

23:27 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  What else do they get to do off-market that they don't often get to do on-market?

23:32 - Luke Gillespie
  Go further down in the process that they don't make it on-market.

23:37 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah. And, like, what do they often get the opportunity to do that they don't on-market?

23:45 - Anke Badenhorst
  Sometimes, like, look for an actual longer conversation with the sellers because they don't have that gatekeeper, the broker, that they have to fight to get through.

23:54 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, they get to build a real relationship, right? And they often get insights. With a business that they don't if it's on market, because if it's on market, the broker wants to put them on a dog and pony show and, you know, meet as many potential sellers as possible.  Because what does the broker get, you know? So, of course, the broker wants to put them out to as many people as possible because they get they get the highest price.  They get a bigger fee. But for clients, speaking of off market, like the owners, 98% of the time are very open, very transparent, willing to have them like come and visit the site and get to know them and willing to walk through the process with them as long as we bring clients with integrity.  Right. And all of our clients care, you know, that's one of the things we vet for before we take them on as clients.  So we can feel like, you know, this is a scary thing to sell your business. It's a scary thing to.  Buy a business, but even better when you can like, you know, develop a relationship with someone before making that decision.  And, you know, ideally it's like a really great fit. So what makes it a great fit?

25:23 - Anke Badenhorst
  The business to the, our client, what makes it a great fit?

25:27 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah.

25:29 - Anke Badenhorst
  The location, just hitting that deal box check marks.

25:34 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Well, be more specific. What makes, what makes it an exceptional fit?

25:39 - Luke Gillespie
  We'll know if it's a good fit, if our client's excited about it and moving on it fast and showing passion and emotion.  We can clearly tell a distinction the way our clients react to different deals.

25:53 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yes. Love that Luke. I think above all, we're not putting it in front of them if it doesn't match their location.  Their financials, right? So like from the criteria that we can look at, we know we wouldn't put it in front of them if it didn't match that.  But when you, and I felt this myself, when you find the business, it's your business, you're going to move mountains to make it happen, you know?  And we see that off-market tends to have more of that kind of connection than on-market does.

26:33 - Anke Badenhorst
  Yeah.

26:36 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah, with the Skylight manufacturing business, I've heard Jason say like multiple times, he said, ah, I really saw myself running this business.  And yeah, that's a good thing.

26:47 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  And we can see them in the business. They can see themselves in the business. That is a key distinction and something that I talk about a lot in content and in this process.  It's like, it's one thing to buy a good business. It's another thing to buy your business and something you are super excited about that will get you out of bed that you connect with like different aspects of it.  So in order to figure out that part, like what clients will like sink their teeth into, what do you think we need to do?  And where do we need to do it?

27:31 - Luke Gillespie
  But we need to trial and error different deals on the on-market, and that's how we gauge what our clients really like or dislike.  when the right off-market opportunity comes, we know which one's the right one.

27:45 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Good. Okay. What do you think we need to do more of? And let's specifically talk about off-market. So where do we need to start looking at whether it could be the right business for them?

28:02 - Luke Gillespie
  Temperature checks.

28:06 - Anke Badenhorst
  Volume.

28:11 - Ida Badenhorst
  I don't know the answer to this one.

28:14 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  You don't know it or you do know it?

28:16 - Ida Badenhorst
  No, I don't.

28:19 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  What part of the process should we be considering, whether it's the right business for someone or not?

28:25 - Anke Badenhorst
  The lead chain, like it should be, it should start with what we want to take a look at. should start in lead chain.

28:34 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  How much time and consideration do you think as a team we give to what leads we're looking for?

28:48 - Ida Badenhorst
  Wow. I'm guessing not a lot since we get a lot of law firms.

28:54 - Anke Badenhorst
  Well, not anymore, but as a team, as a team, none, and I guess. The only eyes on it at this moment is, it's just David.

29:06 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah. Anke, do you remember my philosophy around breathing?

29:15 - Anke Badenhorst
  I remember there was one. It's something like you get what you, the quality of what you get out of it is directly correlated to the quality you put into the brief.  Something like that?

29:29 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yep.

29:30 - Anke Badenhorst
  Yeah.

29:32 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So, and again, David, you're doing the process. You were put at a table and given a process.

29:39 - David R
  So this is by no means, like, and that's what I'm saying.

29:43 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  At different parts of this process, it's going to feel like we're not saying you did anything wrong. We're just looking towards the future now because we realize, you know, there's aspects of this process that we need to dive into.  The whole thing, like every part of the process, we're going to be going to the table re-exam. I just want you to know that you've been doing an exceptional job with the processes that we gave you so far, okay?  So don't take any of this as a personal attack. But thinking about what Anke said around briefing, and you get what you put into it.  This is a philosophy I learned very early in my career, because briefing someone can feel like taking time out of your day and like a waste of time.  So you're just like, hey, do that thing, right? But if you give someone a very limited brief without context details, or making sure that they understood the brief, what do you think you're going to get back in return?

30:48 - Ida Badenhorst
  Confused response.

30:51 - Anke Badenhorst
  Just chose what they understood. Understood, yeah, David.

30:54 - Ida Badenhorst
  We're thinking the same thing.

30:56 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  What did you say? You were talking over each other.

30:59 - David R
  What they understood, basically.

31:00 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, which is probably going to be how much?

31:07 - David R
  I don't know. It depends on the brief, but in this case, probably, I don't know. But it's not what we want, I know.

31:14 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Right. So that's the point of the process that I wanted us to dig into today. And then I also have some homework for the overall part of the process, because you all watch all of the onboarding calls, right?  How much do we pull out of those onboarding calls with consideration for the off-market process that we do?

31:47 - Ida Badenhorst
  Not a lot.

31:50 - David R
  I do it for the brief. I usually take into consideration my notes and the things that I know about every client.  And I try to match the industries with... The notes and with my knowledge of every client. But after that, no, I just keep working the leads.

32:12 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, so quality in, quality out. So if we spend a good amount of time putting our heads together for how can we get the best quality in, right?  Those best quality potatoes to start with, then we're probably more likely to have success, right? Because we're paying a lot of money for leads right now.  And David's following a process that was handed down multiple generations and it was handed down without much consideration, right?  Because it was just like, oh, this is how we did it. It's just telephone. So if we were to just rip up the current process and brainstorm some ideas for how can we...  If get the best potatoes, what would we need to think about? What things would we want to pull out from the client?  What considerations would we want to have to get the best quality potatoes into the French fry factory in the first place?  What do we need to know? Or what do we need to think about? Or what qualities are important?

33:26 - Ida Badenhorst
  Well, from my side, I think you definitely have to just look at the different types of potatoes. Because if you use that analogy, I'm working so hard on the admin side.  If you ask me what kind of deals Jason and Lindsay want, I'm not even going to be able to tell you.  So I definitely think that would be getting to know the clients better.

33:56 - Anke Badenhorst
  I was thinking in terms of kind of like what We tried to do with Joe, so we saw on the onboarding that he had this massive reaction to ice, so we were trying to do a specific ice type of ice sculpture, ice mold, anything IC-related type of an outreach.  So maybe trying to read in between the lines of the onboarding and not only looking at industry lists, geography matches, but just looking for the passion matches and then doing specific, like, focused stuff on passion matches instead of bulk volume on industry location matches.

34:49 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  I'm here.

34:54 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah, just like Ida said, getting to know our clients better. Like, if I were in charge of the off-market...  Search, I know enough about our certain clients, like let's say Stephen Pauly, I know they just like commercial services business, commercial fencing, commercial landscaping, anything like that.  If it's for JJ, right, I know she really likes any commercial service business that's larger, kind of like that large roofing company showed her, we showed her, sorry.  Or for example, for Gil, I know that he would just want an IT company, and I would take just the specific businesses that I know they want and love, and just send out like physical mail letters to those specific businesses in their areas.  Yeah.

35:42 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  I like that train of thought, but let me ask you, do you know why they like each of those business types?

35:50 - Luke Gillespie
  I guess no, not without getting into their head and having that conversation. Some of them, it's just their experience.  Some of them, I think, have just been so influenced. It's by all the content in the space that B2B services businesses is what everyone looks for, but it's not for us to tell our clients whether they're right or wrong.  And maybe I'm just making an assumption right there that I don't even know. Maybe Jenny's dad ran a B2B service business and she has experience with that, right?

36:14 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So no, I don't really know unless we would have that conversation with the clients. Okay. And something you just said, Luke, it's not our place to tell clients what's right or wrong.  Why do our clients hire us?

36:32 - Luke Gillespie
  Sometimes to tell them when they're wrong.

36:35 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Well, like overall, why do they hire us over maybe somebody who's just going to hand them a leads list?

36:42 - Luke Gillespie
  They outsource their decision-making to us due to our expertise in the industry.

36:51 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Well, if you were to like wrap it up in a line or two about how we help people, what would you say that we do?

36:58 - Luke Gillespie
  We find them the right business. business. So I helped them close on it.

37:02 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay. And how do we know what the right business is?

37:05 - Luke Gillespie
  By getting to know them.

37:09 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah.

37:11 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah.

37:12 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  What other... Oh, go ahead, Anke.

37:15 - Anke Badenhorst
  I'm thinking back to when I was like very much, Athena, at the beginning, when I was very much involved in all of the deals.  I remember thinking back, we found a business for Lindsay, and it was this dancing business, and it was freaking perfect, because we knew that Lindsay had a dancing background, and it was one of her passions.  And I'm thinking, I remember with Justin, we were really looking for like, or we were really excited about businesses that had a lot of Spanish-speaking employees, because he is Spanish, and it's kind of like a comfort zone for him.  So thinking back to when, when I was very involved in these deals, we were constantly talking about and thinking.  Talking about and looking for these quirky passion fits of the clients. And I can only think about those because that was back when I was involved with them.  Like Ida said, if you were to ask me, what is Justin, who's one of our newest clients, what is his passion?  I won't be able to tell you what is his passion.

38:23 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  I don't know. Yeah, and not just passions, but skills. Skills, skill sets, backgrounds, what are they good at, right?  So when we're looking at these businesses and we're looking at what they'd be a fit for, if you use my example of the property management business, I was not looking at property management at all.  But why did I connect with that business? Why did I love that business?

38:58 - Ida Badenhorst
  There was a personal connection to it. it. you. minutes. Ok. You

39:03 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Anyone else?

39:04 - David R
  Your background in event planning?

39:08 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Not just event planning. Like, that business was built on relationships and managing multiple relationships, specifically at the corporate level, when I've been in client servicing for 20 years at the corporate level.  And it was replicable, so I could apply my licensing and franchising background. It was a service-based business, right? Like, there was characteristics in it that I was like, oh, my God, I know exactly how to do this, even if I don't know property management.

39:43 - Anke Badenhorst
  Right.

39:45 - Ida Badenhorst
  But you could see yourself in the growth of the business.

39:49 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  I knew how to run a business like that. How to manage relationships, how to manage a service-based business, how to take something that worked very well and replicate it in other areas.  That was a huge. Unique skill set to me, right? Because that was my background at Guinness World Records was building license, license and bold products, like taking a structure and doing it.  did it again at YFood. I managed, like my whole career was about relationships, right? And being in services and working with clients.  So there was so many things in this business that I was like, I am uniquely qualified to run this business or other people might not.  Because not only could I take it over and run the relationships and do corporate level communication and relationship building and maintaining and project managing like multiple teams, but I can also take what they built and standardize it and replicate it in other markets.  And I would have 10X that business in the course of five years, which is how I was able to raise $3 million for it because people saw the connection between me and them.  Business and my passion for it, right? And it's still the one that got away because I saw a plan.  knew what to do. I clicked in. was like, I can  do this, right? And so in order for people to do that, what have we seen multiple times with their clients in terms of being so close on a business?  What happens?

41:24 - Anke Badenhorst
  They get scared.

41:26 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Say more.

41:30 - Ida Badenhorst
  They don't want to take that big risk if they don't see themselves growing in 10 years in the business.

41:39 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Why are they scared?

41:41 - Luke Gillespie
  They get cold feet right when they're staring down the barrel of the multi-million dollar purchase and the personal liability.  It's all the risk involved. And they think they can handle it. And then all the way up to the end when they're about to jump off the ledge, they don't have the confidence in themselves about their abilities and their experience.

42:00 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Like you did with the property management business. Right. And is that a them thing or is that a business thing?

42:08 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah, that's a wrong fit thing. It's not a match thing.

42:13 - Anke Badenhorst
  I think it's twofold. I think it could be a wrong match thing. I think the other thing is they could not see themselves in the business that we can.  Right. So I think the second function of that is our part in showing them what they can see it, like showing them how we see them in the business and opening their eyes to that so that they can actually see that instead of just looking into the personal guarantee and the loan.  They're just looking into that and they're not seeing past that. They're not seeing the potential that we see when we found this business to them.  But I do agree that it could be, we know we found them a business. It's not a great fit.  They don't have a passion for it. And that's why they get scared. Quickly because the risks outweigh the excitement for the business.

43:05 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, but yes, we should understand them deeply before we put a business in front of them and be able to demonstrate why we think they're a good fit for the business.  Once we hand it over and they start getting under the hood, they should lock in and be excited about it and want to take it forward from there, right?  And that intrinsic motivation that it's like, we don't, you saw Lindsay and Kevin, once they locked in and saw how they fit into it, like there was no stopping them.  They came to us for advice. Look at Gil. Gil is like the most, like he had to ask a million different questions, but we locked in.  He's like, I know the customer because I was a customer, right? And I'm a project manager and I liked the owner and she runs it kind of remotely.  Like the qualities that he locked into about this, this IT business or it's an event. Gilson worked in events, but he didn't even consider that as a potential business type for himself, right?  But like his project management background, perfect for an events business. He's been the end customer, which is IT services.  He stood in those conference centers, you know, for days on end. So he knows what the customer experience is like, and he's excited about it, you know, and the way the owner runs the business is like, that's a yes for him because she's able to do it.  It's somewhat passively and remotely, not passively, but like remotely in a sense, and able to travel, which is what he wanted.  So like before we even put the leads into the system, we need to understand what makes a good potato.  And every single client is a different French fry factory, right? Some of them like Cajun, some of them like those thick, weird ones that I don't like those.

44:59 - David R
  Some of them like wedges. You know, some like waffle fries.

45:01 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So before we even start putting those potatoes in, and we kind of need to understand what does the ideal French fry look like, which starts all the way back at how we're profiling them and the information that we're extracting from those buyer profiles.  Now, I would guess that we're just checking some boxes right now using the GPDs and extracting the things and getting it into a thing and putting it in front of the client.  Are we internalizing and connecting with that profile so that when every single one of you are looking at those businesses, you're looking at it through the lens of like, can I see Gil in this business?  Do I know what Gil's unique attributes, skills, and passions are? Do you see how that might make a difference in the whole overall process?  Right. then, so it starts at the beginning.

45:59 - Ida Badenhorst
  Luke's closest to it.

46:00 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  has that interaction. But again, we kind of, you know, I left the kitchen and I will not 100%. Like this is on me.  So that's why I'm back in the kitchen because we're, you know, at a level now, but we're going to make this Michelin level.  It's going to be three Michelin star  French fries coming out of this kitchen when we're done with it. And I am so excited about that, right?  Like I have only eaten in a Michelin restaurant once and it was absolutely incredible and the level of detail that they get.  And it just feels so personalized and amazing. And it's like, you know, there's, I'm going to send you guys this video actually.  I don't know if they ever got it off the ground, but there was a restaurant concept in Japan when I was in my food tech days that we were like obsessed about.  Basically, basically you ate there, they were getting your blood drawn, your DNA tested, like looking at your gut biome, like literally everything that they could do to make you.  Like this personalized, amazing meal, like completely customized to like what you need, you know, they were using printed machines and all sorts of  in there.

47:09 - Ida Badenhorst
  was just the coolest thing, you know, so like highly personalized concierge service is what we're selling.

47:16 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So that's what we need to bring it back to. Are we delivering Michelin level French fries to our clients?  And in order to do that, we need to understand our clients much better to understand what is their ideal French fry.  And then we need to go out and look for the potatoes that are going to be the start of that process to make that French fry.  So it's interesting and it's good. This is why we're talking with each other, because I was actually going to start with the lead brief, but we can't write the brief without really understanding the client profile.  So one of the outcomes of this is going to be, how are we going to look at the profiles different?  Right. Make sure that we're all connecting with every client when we come through and understanding not only what their, everybody else looks at location, geography, and  industry.  Like, why are we doing it that way? Right? Like, we're doing the same thing that we say is bad for everybody else to do, and we're doing that at the start of the process.  We can do this any  way we want. That's the cool thing about being in a startup that is bucking the trend and being an acquisition matchmaker instead of a buy-side advisor.

48:34 - David R
  Give me your location, your geography, and  SDE.

48:37 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  We don't do it that way. So we can do this completely differently. We don't have to follow the process that we've done in the past because we know it's not getting the result that we want.  So what things could we look at? Or even better yet, what things, if they're not asked in the How can we change the onboarding sessions to make sure that we're extracting that information?  Or are we not paying attention to the whole session number one where Athena goes through skills, visions, dreams, background?  Are we not looking at their resume and pulling that sort of stuff? Are we just focused on the business characteristics because we need to get the brief done, get it out, and that's how we do.  So there's probably a couple of things that we need to start looking at as a process in terms of the very first thing that we do with clients and really understanding them and what makes what their perfect franchise looks like.

49:43 - Ida Badenhorst
  I always thought the second onboarding video was the most important, but since you started this, I realized it's the first one because the second one was more going through the geographical and stuff where the first one is more the vision and and more.  You know, how they feel. And I didn't think that's really important to the business. The second one was actually the one that I thought, okay, that's where we're going to get the right business.  But maybe, but you're not going to find the vision of the client. I didn't think of it like that.

50:17 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  It's a vision. you know, the first one, I'm like, what are you into? What books do you read? What do you do when you travel?  Like, what are your interests? What are you obsessed about? What do you tinker around with? Give me like a background on your like career history.  What are you good at? You know, I, Wendy told me a story of a guy who bought a business, perfectly profitable business.  The owner was doing sales. This guy had no sales experience. He bought it, thought sales was beneath him, outsourced it to a tech, ran that business into bankruptcy within six months.  So, Y'all don't know the backgrounds and skill sets of the clients that we have, then you're potentially putting deals in front of them that they would not be a good fit for, right?  So it's not just like, what's their vision, their goals, but like, what are they good at? What are they interested in?  What are we going to get them to walk into? It's such a waste of our time and energy to put something in front of them.  And they're like, eh. And honestly, we've put off-markets in front of people, but I'm like, is it their off-market though?  You know, like, is that the one? Or did we just find one that we got in front of them?  And we've had so few of these opportunities. I seriously question. We haven't had enough data or opportunities to test our theory.  Like, is it them actually getting scared and they'll never, ever pull the trigger? Or did we just not put enough of light?  Put  amazing fit deals in front of them. That's what I want us to test, right? Because if we get so good at putting amazing fit deals in front of people, then we're genuinely going to be able to figure out, well, who has what it takes to put it over the finish line?  So, there's, in terms of the brief for the industries, let's actually stay on, like, understanding the client profiles. What can we do to understand them better?  Like, with the stuff we already have, what are you guys, what are your ideas?

52:55 - David R
  Now that we've talked about this, what are your ideas for getting to know the clients better?

53:03 - Ida Badenhorst
  Maybe take another look at their onboarding videos.

53:08 - David R
  Yeah, I was going to say maybe, because I usually take notes on stuff that is important for our clients.  So let's say, for example, Joe, he likes ice. Or for example, JJ, she likes wood, for example. She mentions that in the call.  So I think it's about to understand really the passion of every client and the hobbies and the stuff they do when they're not working at all.  Because usually the things that you do after you work is the things that probably excite you most. For example, I play music after I work, for example.  So this is something that's my passion. I would love to play music every day, every single hour. So probably if we understand what is their passion, what is the things that they do after.  You know, a busy day. Those are the insights that we can, you know, extract and try to understand what really excites them, what really, you know, catches their attention.  So this is one of the things I was thinking, maybe pulling those notes or pulling this information out of those calls and try to make a list.  Okay, this is what really this client likes. And also the experience, I think, is also important to have, you know, because if they don't have experience in sales, for example, so it's going to be hard to put a business that requires sales in front of them because they're not good at that.  So, yes, I think, for example, Dustin and DL, they say, like, they don't want to do sales. So these different things, different insights, I think we got, we have to pull everything out and try to, you know, make a list of these specific things that really excite our clients that they're good at or they have experience on.

54:58 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Exactly. It's not just like, okay, we know they don't like. But like, what are they good at? What's their background?  You know, like, what, what, what makes them tick? It's not hobbies and interests are a great area. Like, with Lindsay, it wasn't just the fact that she had a dance background.  Actually, the way that deal came about was, I saw the dance studio and I was like, God, dance moms are crazy.  Do you, do you know what I mean when I say dance moms?

55:31 - Anke Badenhorst
  Yeah.

55:32 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  The mothers of the little, usually it's little girls, right? The mothers of the kids in dance are crazy. They're like, you know, sometimes they like want to be the star of the show or whatever.  They're just a certain breed. And I was like, wow, Lindsay and Kevin would be amazing with dance moms. Because I just, I know like what they're like and they would not be, you know, I just see Lindsay being.  So good with them, but like holding your boundaries and like, I completely understand that little Jane's costume wasn't right.  Let me go and fix that. You know, like, and Kevin also, I see him, like they wanted to be, what was important to them was they wanted to be a part of the community.  I knew they had a certain disposition that would be really great with dance moms. Um, this thing had real estate.  was close to their house. And I was like, okay, but I wonder if Lindsay has a dance background. So I actually did a temp check on it.  was like, hey, Lindsay, do you like dance in your background? And she's like, I was a competition dancer. I was like, oh my God.  Okay. Like, here we go. Right. It had all the characteristics that they were looking for involved in the community, close to the house.  You know, the numbers looked good. And she had, and they would be good with that clientele, which not everybody would.  So when we're thinking about giving our clients a competitive edge, I'm Like, most of the people that were going to go and try to buy a dance studio, one of them was my friend Aaron Signer, who does not have dance mom energy at all.  And I was like, dude, why are you going after, like, stop, like, this is not for you, don't. You know, and he was just going after literally every business.  So as an owner, getting all these people that are like, do you even know what dance is? Right? Like, I've built a dance school in my community for 20 years.  Of course, it's going to be important to her who takes over that legacy. And then on top of that, like, Lindsay actually has a dance background.  was like, this is perfect, you know, so Lindsay and Kevin went, they did in-person meetings, they loved the owner, everything looked amazing.  And then the broker  up on our numbers, and it was actually 100,000 less in SCE than it was advertised.  So had that one been as advertised. They would have moved on that. They were ready to make an offer on that business.  So when I was looking at businesses, I was thinking, how do they fit into it? Okay. The media agency that they bought, Kevin is in sales for a PR company.  Lindsay works for a insights and consulting company. Buying a media agency, right, is like Kevin can do the sales.  Lindsay does project management and client work. Perfect team. The design and build landscaping. Lindsay really wanted a service-based business.  She wanted to be able to get her hands dirty and do something like that. And it was a subcontracted business.  So the owner himself was subcontracting out the work. Very easy for her to pick up and do like a service-based contract design project management type thing because that was her background.  So they didn't necessarily pick those businesses. And they were like, I didn't even think of a media agency, didn't even think of buying that.  But when I was looking at deals for clients, that's how I was looking at it. was like, well, can I see this person in the business?  And that's the foundation of what this business was built on is that we want to put businesses in front of people that they wouldn't have considered for themselves, like an acquisition matchmaker, right?  Everybody comes to us and they're like, I'm on a six foot four, blonde haired, blue eyes, trust fund, works in finance.  And we're like, okay, you know, go away and look. And it's like, I know you said you wanted that, but I have a five foot ten brunette.  Y'all have the same sense of humor and values. I really think you should go on a date. So I need to do a better job of communicating my thesis to you all as to why we exist.  That is what we're here for. Yes, we are there to steer them in a different direction, Luke, because they all want the six foot more blonde haired, blue eye, trust fund, and finance.  You know, that's a very small percentage, but that's what they had exposure to. So if we know them better than they know themselves, then we're going to be like, but your sense of humor and you both really love this band.  And, you know, I know they're not the exact type, but like actually it kind of sucks to have someone that tall anyway.  So like, why don't you go and look at this instead? But we can't do that if we don't understand them to that level.  And like I said, understand them better than they understand themselves. And I haven't even thought like, and we started experimenting with this too, giving them a personality profiling and stuff like that.  Like we can do whatever we want in the onboarding process to get to know them. But if I'm spending two hours of Athena time, right?  Y'all know how expensive Athena time is, right? Two hours with every client and y'all aren't even watching that part of the onboarding process.  And you think the second one is more important.

1:00:56 - Anke Badenhorst
  Why do you think I personally invest my time into this? That's part of the onboarding process.

1:01:06 - Ida Badenhorst
  I don't know. Still, the other day, I didn't know people pay for the onboarding boards. You mentioned it the other day, and I didn't even know.

1:01:15 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  That made me realize. How we charge them, it's always been kind of the same amount of money. So what we say, them signing on for.  But why do you think I personally take that for session? Why have I not asked for the very first session?

1:01:37 - Ida Badenhorst
  To get the most important details that you know they need to give us.

1:01:43 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  It's the most important one.

1:01:45 - Ida Badenhorst
  That's the most important one.

1:01:48 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Business characteristics. Whatever. They're going to ask for a six-foot-four man in finance with blonde hair and blue eyes, right?  Like, we know that. They don't know what they don't know. That's why they come to us. But the reason why I personally do that first call is because I want to understand their psychology.  I want to understand what makes them tick. I want to understand what they'd be good at. I want to understand what they're interested in because I want to put businesses in front of them that they never would have considered.  And they're like, oh, my God, like my heart's broken. We never found Joe and I's business because I can guarantee you if we did, we'd probably have a very different reaction from them.  Okay, so I think let's take I'm trying to decide whether five or ten minutes. I would like to make another coffee.  So we'll end on time. Do y'all want five or ten minutes?

1:02:51 - David R
  I can divide.

1:02:53 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Five minutes? Okay, give me six. We'll come back at ten past, okay? And then we can think about how we're going to implement all of  we just talked about.

1:03:02 - David R
  Great.

1:03:03 - Ida Badenhorst
  Okay.

1:03:03 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Cool. Okay. See you guys in six minutes. Thank you. Thank you.

1:08:10 - Ida Badenhorst
  Luke, I am so tired on your behalf.

1:08:19 - Anke Badenhorst
  Oh, come on, Ida. You got used to the night thing pretty quickly. Remember, you went to bed at like 7 p.m.  every evening, and now suddenly you're night out? Your body adjusts to your new work schedule.

1:08:33 - Ida Badenhorst
  He's not working at night, he's working in the morning, he's literally seeing the sun coming up every day.

1:08:42 - Anke Badenhorst
  Luke, so what hours do you actually sleep? What's your sleeping schedule looking like?

1:08:48 - Luke Gillespie
  I normally sleep whenever I get off work, which is 7, 8 a.m. my time. And then I'll sleep like, I'll just sleep 8 hours.  Plus whatever time I get to bed after work. So if I finish work at 7, I probably get into bed at 8 a.m.  Like if we finish work at 8 a.m. my time today, I'll get in bed like 8.30 maybe. And then plus eight hours.  So like 4 p.m. ish, 4.30 p.m., 5.30 p.m. I'll wake up. Yeah.

1:09:20 - Anke Badenhorst
  When you wake up and you start your day, the day is then over. So what do you do? Do you actually go tour somewhere?  No, yeah. Then you go to the club.

1:09:30 - Ida Badenhorst
  It's like, okay, I'm ready for the club. Just set an alarm to be back for work.

1:09:37 - Luke Gillespie
  No, I wake up, I go to the gym, I take a shower, I like do whatever stretching I'll do.  I'll read my book, you know, do the normal stuff I would normally do after work in my afternoon, but during the day.  They're like, oh yeah, it's the afternoon, the same time afternoon that I would have been doing it after work in California, but it's just technically the morning of my day.  So it's all mis-jumping.

1:10:02 - Ida Badenhorst
  Do you have like strong curtains to make sure there's not sun coming in? Or can you sleep during a bright night like My curtains are all right, but I use like the little princess mask anyways, so it doesn't matter to me.

1:10:14 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah.

1:10:14 - Anke Badenhorst
  Yeah.

1:10:17 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  All right. So I find that sometimes having a few minutes break, I start thinking about things and next steps or actions.  Did anybody get any of those brain waves?

1:10:30 - Anke Badenhorst
  Yeah, was thinking, you know, we spend a lot of time building out the investor profile, but that's just for external.  That's what we use for owners and brokers and stuff. But we don't spend a lot of time working on the internal profile.  Like I do a first glance at it and it kind of just sits there. And I feel like what David did with these new sheets of pulling in the SDE ceilings and stuff is like a start.  But I feel like the internal profile needs some work in terms of... of what we just spoke about, passions, as well as skills and background.  So essentially, the industries and geography matches does the initial pull, but the final check marks needs to go through the internal profile, kind of like, you know, doing that final check does this.  And I'm speaking more in terms of on-market, and I know this is actually an off-market discussion, but I just want to say that the internal profile has to be like the final check mark before we, put business in front of somebody, does it fit the internal profile?

1:11:35 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Well, I would argue it needs to be checked at every stage of the process before it moves forward.

1:11:42 - Anke Badenhorst
  Yeah, that's definitely, that makes so much sense.

1:11:46 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Right, and like the brief that even goes out to the team to research the leads, like, are we being as, as, um, as,  Thorough and as detailed as we can be, but like before we even get to the brief, Anke, you touched on something.  I actually had the same thought. I think we need to get better at doing internal client, new client briefing, right?  So if we want to brief everyone on the team working on the same information on what we took as the important takeaways from the onboarding process and, you know, like having everybody watch the videos, like it's four hours of videos.  I know y'all are 2xing it and probably doing it while you do over the work. It's a lot. It's a heavy lift.  So we can be doing better in terms of extracting the information from those sessions and putting it into a format that is like a briefing for every new client.  And maybe we do it on, you know, the vetting team calls where we take 15 minutes to go through like a new client briefing and then everybody reads it in their we're going to talk.  And something like that. So that overall process of like, how do we get to know our new clients? What information are we extracting from those sessions?  How are we extracting it and regurgitating it so everybody's on the same page as to what's important to this person?  And do we understand them? And like, at different points, do different people need to dive into different aspects of those sessions, you know?  So I imagine we could probably leverage AI for some portions of this too. Because something I was thinking about was like, well, if we feed all this information in and then give it the brief, like, we want to think of industries that maybe they wouldn't have even thought of.  And like, here's the ones they don't want. But like, are there different types of businesses or whatever that this person would be uniquely skilled for?  Like, how are we using agents? AI is to help us think through, like, what would be a good fit?  Or how can we create a better profile to pull the important things away? Because Anke is exactly right. The external facing profile is not good enough for us to understand whether something's a good fit for a person or not.  That is basically to create credibility for our clients and, like, give you guys a tool to be able to be like, no, there's a real person, right?  And here's their background. Do we know what industries that they've worked in before? Do we know what skill sets they have?  Do we know what their visions are? Do we know what their concerns are? Do we know what their passions are?  That doesn't go into an external profile.

1:14:56 - Anke Badenhorst
  Yeah, everything should go into the internal profile.

1:15:00 - Ida Badenhorst
  I do agree with you when you said before it goes to the next stage, because when I just think of the on-market, sometimes you just work it, it gets to SIMS receive, and then Luke's love, they're not into this.  You know, it wasted the whole pipeline's time working on the something that Luke in the end told us it's not a fit, but if everyone in the pipeline is on top of it, we can see it very quickly, or just maybe see something that will work for them very quickly.

1:15:39 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Ida, I know you have a background in psychology, is that right?

1:15:43 - Ida Badenhorst
  Yeah, yeah.

1:15:44 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Did you have to do profiling or, like, write-up summaries about people or assessments or anything like that during your time in psychology?

1:15:53 - Ida Badenhorst
  Yeah, sometimes I had to do that, please. It was a while ago, but we did have to do that, please.

1:16:00 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Is that something that you feel like you'd know how to get started on, to write a profile or an assessment on our clients?

1:16:08 - Ida Badenhorst
  Yes, yes. We actually learned to do that on our practical assignments. We had to get groups, and then we had to choose five people from the community, and we had to build internal profiles on them.

1:16:26 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So, I, and I might not understand who does what in the process now, but are you still majority, like, are you still the one that's the majority responsible for getting the profiles together now, too?

1:16:40 - Ida Badenhorst
  Yes, yes. That was given to me a while ago. Anke gave me how to change them online.

1:16:49 - Anke Badenhorst
  Just to give you the context, I, at this moment, I still process everything, and then basically I build the skeleton of the internal profile, and then I...
  ACTION ITEM: Create psych profile outline from existing onboarding info. List additional info needed for deeper client understanding (e.g. risk tolerance, resilience). Due Friday. - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/291303000?timestamp=4625.9999

1:17:00 - Ida Badenhorst
  And then Eda feeds in missing small information that GTP didn't pick up. Is that what you mean? Yes, that's how the system works at the moment.  Or change whatever Luke and David asks me to change on.

1:17:16 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So I think we need a couple of things here. I think we need a list of the things that we want to pull out to be able to create a profile on someone.  I think, Eda, you're uniquely qualified out of all of us. Like, if you were to do a psychological profile, what things would you be including in that profile?  In addition to what we already collect, right? Because we're now finding risk aversion and, you know, follow through and those sorts of things are an issue.  So I think that could be a fun one for you to brainstorm. You know, if we were to do a psychological assessment on someone's, like, readiness to be a business owner.  be a business owner. And what kind of business that they would be interested in? What kind of things would we need to be pulling out?  And then we can look at our onboarding process and think about, I've already thought about this anyway. Like, do we need to be doing better, having them do some personality assessments, getting to understand them on an even deeper level than we already do?  So that when we're looking at businesses, we have all that in mind to the point that we kind of know them better than they know themselves.  And this is also one of the selling points that we have as a business is, like, we spot their patterns so we can help them get out of their own way.  So the things that they do over and over again, which they don't realize, like, Chris was presenting offers under asking over and over again, and then he kept losing opportunities because he was doing that.  And now he's, you know, got one that wants to sign and another one that he's, like, you know, working on.  But it was interesting that he kept doing that, you know? So, like, being... We were to spot their patterns and understand them better than they understand themselves so we can help them, you know, get out of their own way and achieve success.  So that really starts with understanding them. So an action for Ida is like to have a go at writing what criteria or what information can we collect on people, both from the sessions that we already have and what would also be useful to us to understand about them.  As we go through this process. And that's different than the business characteristics. We have all that, right? But hobbies, interests, skill sets, background, what industries they've had exposure to.  Because familiarity is likely going to make them want to move closer, too. So even in their corporate careers, if they've had exposure to certain industries, which is why I asked that question in the onboarding, right?  They're more likely to feel confident in it. Because look at gifts. Well, he's had exposure to the events industry because he stood at  event stands all day long for, like, conventions and stuff, even though he's never worked in the business.
  ACTION ITEM: Research AI/agents to utilize or use all this information that we have for every client, the briefs, the psycho profiling and all this information, and be able to build a better brief and also train or fine tune these models or these agents. So they are capable of understanding every client. And also we can ask the AI, for example, which industry you think is a good fit for a client based on all this information we have. Also to build a brief for Mazan, for example, so we can have these agents, these AIs. Very good fine-tune so they understand really what we need, what we want, and then we can ask the AI to build the briefs and to create the different things that we need for every client. So basically, do research on that and how can we use these tools that are already out there in our favor. - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/291303000?timestamp=4804.9999  So he feels competent enough to move forward on the business because he had exposure to it. So then, David, I think for you, I would like you to think about how we could use AI or technology to take this information that we're extracting from.  And think of how we can use that information to be more thoughtful on the briefs that we're giving around the industries.  And maybe it's not even industries, right? Like, maybe we need to scrap the way we've been researching businesses in the first place and think about, like, is there a different way for us to go and look for businesses that are going to be a good fit for them?  And could we use AI in some ways? the initial thing that I'm thinking is... Like, if we feed all this information that Ida extracts from all their profiles into AI and then say, like, what industries would this person be good for?

1:21:09 - Ida Badenhorst
  What kind of businesses would this person be good for?

1:21:12 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  You see what I'm saying? And then, rather than going to Masson and being like, okay, let's start with the A's.  There's thousands of accountants in every single place, right? Or even some of the, like, I was going through the briefs that we have, and it's like real estate.  was like, well, most real estate businesses are not actually businesses. It can be sold because it's going to be real estate investment, property, but it's not going to, you know.  So, like, we need to get more specific with the briefs that we're giving and give more information or think about, like, how are we taking this information and actioning it in a way that's going to get us those Michelin-level potatoes for the Cajun fries that D.L.  like and the waffle fries that D

1:22:01 - Ida Badenhorst
  Do you see what I'm saying?

1:22:04 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So David, you don't need to necessarily come up with a criteria, but when you have that criteria, how can you use AI or tech to build more meaningful briefs to be able to give to the team and also to the leads that we're researching?  And how can we look at that process differently with Massam's team, right? Like, do we want to research differently?  Because at the moment, we're giving them cities and some and others, saying like, anything in this yard?

1:22:38 - Ida Badenhorst
  Like, how are we actually creating a replicable system that we know exactly how to go after off-market deals that somebody is going to get excited about?  Yeah. Basically making our work, sorry.

1:22:54 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Let's go ahead, Ida.

1:22:56 - Ida Badenhorst
  Basically making our work easier, because now in the pipeline, There's like a hundred deals with different businesses, but they're just 20% of those deals is accurate.  So if we can get them in the beginning right, basically every deal that goes through the pipeline, whether it's on or off market, will be a fit.

1:23:16 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  If we just do it easier enough. Yeah. And to David's point about personalization and making them feel like we handpicked them for a conversation.  How's that going to feel when we've done all that to research them? And we know that you just got an amazing psychological profile on this person.  So we know exactly why they would be a good fit for the business that we handpicked to research and get in touch with.  How is that going to change the very beginning conversation that we have?

1:23:48 - Ida Badenhorst
  Oh, very good. Very good.

1:23:53 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  And then, so we're not going to get there yet, but then when we start looking at each table in this process,
  ACTION ITEM: Summarize mission, goals, overview from meeting. Create new client brief & internal profile structure. Set up case study structure for Luke. - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/291303000?timestamp=5042.9999  We're going to bring the template table up and be like, okay, how are we personalizing this outreach? How are we making this outreach considerate of what we think is super, all the talk, all the stuff that we talked about earlier.  So Anke, this is going to be our mission, our objectives, why we're doing this, what we want the experience to be for the owners and the clients.  And how are we reflecting that in the templates and the way that we are going out to people? So we can still have a template and we can customize and personalize.

1:24:33 - David R
  And at the next stage, that'll be, you know, David and Anke looking at the processes and how do we actually do that?

1:24:39 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So we can extract the information from the client profiles. We can reach out to hand-selected businesses and be like, hey, our buyer like has grown up in your area forever and loves your business.  And we think you should have a talk. Wouldn't you want to hand over to somebody that's a local, right?  And so it's weird. I don't know how we got so. I'm so far away from this, but when I was doing my own off-market outreach, every single business I got in touch with, I personalized it.  I gave them a personal reason why I was getting in touch. I looked at their website, and I figured out what was cool about their website, or how I could compliment them, or like, congratulations on that word that you got.  Like, I did that myself, right? Right, so somehow we've gone to these emails, and I'm just like, oh my god, we sound like PE, getting in touch with people, right?

1:25:32 - Anke Badenhorst
  It's not who we are, or what we represent.
  ACTION ITEM: Watch cold email training in Closers (2.5 hrs). Take notes, brainstorm ideas for process improvement. - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/291303000?timestamp=5132.9999

1:25:36 - Ida Badenhorst
  Yeah, yeah, yeah, no, I definitely agree.
  ACTION ITEM: Watch cold email training in Closers (2.5 hrs). Take notes, brainstorm ideas for process improvement. - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/291303000?timestamp=5132.9999

1:25:43 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So, the other thing I want everybody to do is I want everyone to watch the cold email training in closers, because that's going to be the next thing that we're working on.
  ACTION ITEM: Watch cold email training in Closers (2.5 hrs). Take notes, brainstorm ideas for process improvement. - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/291303000?timestamp=5132.9999  If we all understand the process that we're trying to go through, because we, at every point, are going through a sales process.
  ACTION ITEM: Watch cold email training in Closers (2.5 hrs). Take notes, brainstorm ideas for process improvement. - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/291303000?timestamp=5132.9999
  ACTION ITEM: Give team access to cold email training in Closers. - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/291303000?timestamp=5132.9999  Cold email sucks, right? But if we all understand basic principles in sales and cold email outreach and how to get people to the next step, then each of you and your independent part of the process are going to be that much better at it.  So then we're all singing off the same hymn sheet. So Anke can get you all access to that part because the next thing that I'm going to want us to do after we get the beginning part, what's the brief look like to the team?  What's the client profile? How are we briefing everyone internally? So Anke, that's going to be you, right? Like what does a new client brief look like?  What is the information that we need to get? So Ida, David, Luke, myself, all understand this person intimately, but it doesn't take four hours of everybody's time watching those videos.

1:26:51 - Ida Badenhorst
  Yeah, that makes sense.

1:27:03 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay, so I also, I didn't have an assignment for this, but Luke, I think this one might fall on you because it's going to be relevant to you taking calls anyway.  And what I wanted us to do is start building out case studies of businesses that we got matched to a client and see what we did in order to get it to that place.
  ACTION ITEM: Listen to calls for Mill's med spa & Joann's spa in the city deals. Outline call structure, extract key info for moving to next stage. Start filling case study format from Anke. - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/291303000?timestamp=5236.9999  So Luke, want you to kind of work backwards and listen to the calls, right? So because that's going to be the next part of the process that you're going to be owning.  So if you understand what was said on those calls, what the owner, like how that rapport was built, how you extracted the information from them, then that's going to help us earlier on in the process.  When you understand what do we need to do to get them to the point that they're ready, you're going to be doing this anyway.  So this is one of those, you and I are going to be working and reactively trying to like cobble together.  While we're building out a long-term, overall sustainable process. But I want us to do case studies of successful deals.  And Anke, you'll probably need to create the format for us to drop it in. But it's basically like going into the deal record.  What was like, just putting it into a document or something. You can figure out the format. But what was every single touch with every single person that we got an introduction to a client on?  And I have notes in the handbook on the Athena notes page. I think of which ones I could think about.  Oh, yeah, you already did those. Okay. Okay. So, start here. Okay. Luke, there's two. That I sourced, that I just tagged you in, in the Athena notes.  was Mill who had a med spa and then spa in the city, which was Josanne who also had a med spa.  And I want you to start listening to those calls because that's going to help you in your training anyway.  And I want you to pull out the things that you think made that call effective to get it to the next step.  So if you were to start outlining a script of how those calls go and what was done, and then you can start working through all those deals.  Anke will create a format for us to do individual case studies for each of the deals. But in the meantime, Luke, that's your assignment and outcome from this week is to start listening to those calls and seeing if you can start outlining and filling in that part of the handbook that's very empty, right?  In terms of like how we do owner calls and how we move them to the next stage. But more importantly, what are we saying on those calls?  to get them comfortable to move to the next stage and giving us enough information to decide whether it's a good fit.
  ACTION ITEM: Give team access to cold email training in Closers. Move next deep dive to 3-5pm. - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/291303000?timestamp=5408.9999

1:30:07 - Luke Gillespie
  Is that a clear enough brief for that aspect? Yeah, I got it.

1:30:12 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Great.

1:30:14 - Luke Gillespie
  This is do this by our deep dive next week.

1:30:19 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, if you all can get it to me at the end of the week, because then I use my Monday time to review everything and plan for the next deep dive.  And then, Anke, we need to put in the deep dive for next week. So I'm thinking, move it up an hour, like three to five, rather than starting at four, if everybody's available then, because I know it's kind of late for a few of you folks to go until six.  Okay, so does that sound like clear actions for everybody in terms of what to do this week?

1:30:53 - Ida Badenhorst
  Yes. And you would like it by Friday.

1:30:56 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yes, by Friday.

1:30:58 - Ida Badenhorst
  All right.

1:30:59 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  right.

1:31:01 - David R
  Let me just see.

1:31:11 - Anke Badenhorst
  Athena, another hour and a half or just did you mean for it to be an hour?

1:31:15 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  No, it should be two hours. That's why I was saying three to five. I don't think we put in the deep dives yet.  And then the following Monday, I won't be around, so we'll need to figure out if we do it that week.  We both have some holiday overlapping. And then the following Monday after that, just a reminder, it's Memorial Day, so everybody has that off on the 26th.  But we'll find some times to work around this because with Austin taking sales off my plate, getting the client schedules dialed in, I'm getting some time freed up and I'm allocating some time for training.  So we just might put these deep dives at different times. It's not on the Monday. Okay. I'll be seeing  See what else I had on my notes. And then, so the training for cold email, I want everybody to finish that before our next deep dive.  So you can have the Monday too. And I think it was about an hour and a half, maybe of content to watch.  But it's two hours in total. Okay. So just allocate and you can do it in sections, right? There's little, little bits here and there.  So I would give yourselves maybe like plan out like 30 minutes a day over the next week. So you get it done by the next call.  Yeah. Because if we're all kind of like talking through that, and as you're watching it, want you to think, like compare it to your part of the process, what you know, see if you come up with ideas, write down your brainstorms for how we can do things better or differently, right?  So don't just watch it. Like, let it have you all come up with, like, different ideas for how we can use that information, you know, because it's like sales, to me, is solving a problem for someone.  So these owners have a problem, you know, and we're solving a problem by putting an amazing person in front of them that can take over their legacy.  And they're going to have different problems as they go through this process. Like, don't know what their business is worth, or how this process even works, or they don't want to, like, pay a bunch of fees, or they don't want to get screwed over, they don't want to get scammed.  So we have to overcome those objections and those problems through this process, and there's different ways we can do that, right?  So, like, next time when we come together, we'll revisit what you all have come up with and talk through that, and then probably take some actions to implement some of that stuff.  Then we'll start doing what we did today, and we'll talk about the whole email process, right?

1:33:59 - Ida Badenhorst
  Hmm.

1:35:00 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  And that's what excites me the most, is like, I've been talking about off-market for a long time, and now it's like, okay, I'm getting back up in this kitchen, and we're going to, like, figure this out together, because I have a vision of how this all works.  You guys are the ones that, like, absolutely can make this happen, and look what you've done with on-market. I don't know if you realize, like, how phenomenal it is that we do what we do on-market.  You know no one else does this, right? Like, no one. I'm planning the webinar for acquiring minds right now, and talking about the other, like, advisory and search services.  Nobody does on-market, because it's  hard. And we're just, like, flippantly, like, we're putting, like, four deals in front of a client every month.  Like, brokers did not want to talk to me, or Ryan, or Luke. We started, you know. Ida, like, they didn't want to talk to you either.  We figured out a way to do what nobody else has... been able to do and get on-market deals in volume in front of clients like it's phenomenal so if we can do that for the harder part of this process imagine what we're  gonna do for off-market yeah we're gonna be unstoppable because we  care and we want to leave them better than we found them and we want to introduce them to people that are gonna take over their legacy and we have really great clients to make introductions to we have something none of the these other people have because everybody else just works with investors right they want to like tear up their business and just source things and they're not caring about the heart or the personality or why it's a good fit like that's gonna feel so good for the owner and our clients so I'm really excited I hope you guys are I know this is gonna be this is a big lift right it's a lot of work but like we nail this and we are and we're gonna nail it quick nail it quick because  We do this every week and we deep dive like this. Just imagine how different that's going to feel when we're all like, oh my God, we have a full client briefing and we understand what makes them tick.  And we're going to be thinking about every step of the process. Even Edo's, you know, signing in days is going to be like, hang on a minute.

1:37:18 - David R
  Like, you know what I mean?

1:37:19 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Isn't that cool? Yeah.

1:37:21 - Ida Badenhorst
  Yeah. It feels like there's a bit more sense of direction. It's not like when you said about the tarmac, it doesn't feel like everyone's just running around.  It feels like we're actually coordinating running around now.

1:37:34 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yes. I will, I will, like over my dead body priority client system ever happening again.

1:37:44 - Anke Badenhorst
  Yeah, well, it makes sense.

1:37:46 - Ida Badenhorst
  It makes sense. Like if you pick the right potato in the beginning, it will work. But because there were so many deals and so many things to work with, and we didn't know exactly what the client wanted, the work just went.  And up and up and up. then we're like, you know, let's prioritize the clients. And then Athena gets a heart attack.

1:38:08 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Well, and it was necessity, right? Because like we have contractual obligations. So we were doing, sorry, I'm getting tired of standing now.  So my desk is coming down as I call it. Just hit a button and it knows where to go.  Oh, that might be too low. All right, whatever. Okay, so let me see if there's anything else. Okay, I went through and I realized like there's a ton of resources and like copy that we already had.  Anke, I'm so confused how the copy got to where it was when we had all those copy documents. That doesn't seem like that translated.  Or it's just been like changed a bunch. But that's what we're going to go through next time is like how and.  But it will be a lot more helpful if everybody's watched the sales process on cold emailing so we can figure out best practice, what things we want to say, what might cause people some concern in terms of responding to us, that sort of thing.  And if we start thinking about personalizing it from day one, then we'll be able to implement that at every stage of the process too.  But we'll able to do it at scale. And that's what I think is so cool about technology is like we know what we want it to do.  We've done this analog. We've done the hand emailing. So now we can use technology to just help us along a little bit.  Anke, can you summarize the actions for everybody? And I just want to make sure everybody understands the brief. Or actually, rather than Anke summarizing, I want you each to play it back to me and tell me what your understanding of what your action item is.

1:39:55 - Luke Gillespie
  Yes, this week. I am going to do it. Deep dive case study of these two off-market deals from the past, the med spa from Mill and the Joann spa in the city.  I'll get the deal specifics, hopefully, from Anke later. I'm going to listen to all the calls, look at all the email communications, all the messaging in the background, and basically just do a study, an analysis of how we worked that deal from start to finish and write down notes of what went well and kind of what exactly you did so that we can replicate that on future deals.

1:40:29 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay, great. And I want you to start with the calls. So don't worry about the upfront communication yet. See how we get to on the calls.  But, you know, if it helps you context-wise, then maybe do do all the emails. And then, Anke, like, how quickly do you think you can get a framework together for the case study for Luke to start filling in?

1:40:50 - Anke Badenhorst
  I was going to start working on that after this call so we can get it as soon as possible.

1:40:56 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay, great. So, Luke, you can get started on listening to the calls and start out. Defining what you think the structure is and then dropping that into the case study format that Anke will fill out.  How's that sound?

1:41:07 - Luke Gillespie
  Yep, sounds good.

1:41:08 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Great. Okay, good. Who's next?

1:41:11 - Ida Badenhorst
  Okay, next. Okay, you would like me to create a list or a document of questions and things we can use to ask the clients to create like an internal profile.  Use like a psychological background to just figure out the deeper things of the client and make a list for you and then you can approve and we can use that on the onboarding you do.

1:41:41 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yes, great. So to dive into that one a little bit deeper, what I would love to see is rather than questions to ask, is there profile aspects that we can pull from the stuff we already have?  So the ways that we can understand that, like with what we have now, how can we do a psychological profile on it?  And then in addition to that, what else could we ask or do to understand them in an even deeper level?

1:42:08 - Ida Badenhorst
  Oh, okay. Yeah, because it's going to be a pretty big question.

1:42:12 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, so we kind of skipped over the first part of the onboarding session. So like with everything we have there, how can we start building an internal psychological profile or just profile on this person?  Like what their background is, what their interests are, what their hobbies are, what their skill set is, exposure, and then anything else that came up that like might be interesting, like they're scared of this or they're really interested in this.  So use what we have first and see if you can like outline that so we can at least take all the sessions that we have and building it.  And then what additional information would also be great to fill in the blanks to, you know, of like fear or resilience or follow through or accountability or, you know.  These things that people need.

1:43:02 - Ida Badenhorst
  Yeah.

1:43:03 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Well, like, like qualities that a business owner will need. The qualities that someone will need to move forward on a deal.  Like, how are we rating them on their resilience or their action, spike fear, risk tolerance, you know, that sort of thing.

1:43:26 - Ida Badenhorst
  Yeah.

1:43:27 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So there's a lot of information actually already in the onboarding and Anke can get you the questions if you don't have them already, because there's a lot that we like ask them as part of that process.  So, yeah, two parts. Work with what we have and then what would also be nice to have to fill in and fill in more gaps.

1:43:49 - Ida Badenhorst
  Gaps. Okay. Will do. Excited about that.

1:43:52 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Great. Cool. Use your skill set, too.

1:43:55 - Ida Badenhorst
  That was one of the things that interested me about you was, like, the fact that you had that.

1:44:00 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  That kind of background.

1:44:01 - Ida Badenhorst
  Because a lot of what we're doing is psychological work, right? It's coaching, psychological.

1:44:06 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So empathetic, understanding why people are acting the way that they are, and it's not necessarily rational.

1:44:13 - Ida Badenhorst
  So it's important that we're always looking at things through that lens also. So, yeah. Great.

1:44:20 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Cool.

1:44:21 - David R
  All right. And in my case, I'm going to do research on AI or agents to utilize or use all this information that we have for every client, the briefs, the psycho profiling and all this information, and be able to build a better brief and also train or fine tune these models or these agents.  So they are capable of understanding every client. And also we can ask the AI, for example, which industry you think is a good fit for a client based on all this information we have.  Also to build a brief for Mazan, for example, so we can have these agents, these AIs. Very good fine-tune so they understand really what we need, what we want, and then we can ask the AI to build the briefs and to create the different things that we need for every client.  So basically, do research on that and how can we use these tools that are already out there in our favor.

1:45:19 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Again, you know, I like that. So there's two parts, right? Like how can we use the agents to better understand the clients and build better briefs, but also what kind of brief, like how can we edit the briefs themselves to match that?  And if you want, if you don't already have it, Anke can give you access to client profiles, all of the transcripts, everything, even with the sales calls, that sort of thing.  Like if you want to use that to run some test cases and run it through and start experimenting with some things because it's one thing to research it.

1:45:58 - David R
  I actually used them for this. For the assets and the equity, I used the transcripts and I put it into AI, IGBT, Grok, and all this stuff.  then I asked, okay, give me the assets.

1:46:12 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  might be interesting if you guys aren't already, but like to also feed through all of the sales conversations with the clients.  Because it might pick up on, you know, if you have the AI, maybe you have like different agents. It's like, give me a psychological profile.  Give me like a work history profile. I don't know. Like, because I know when I went to the real estate marketing thing, they had a different agent for copywriting.  They had a different agent for strategy. They had a different agent for, you know, that sort of thing. So, and then, and then they like would sometimes pull them all in like, okay, like now tell me based on person.  So we could do business coaches, we could do like a psychologist, we could do, you know, so like more of the people.  If we were to have like a rockstar profiling team, how can we create. It's for that. And then those sales transcripts might reveal things about them that none of us would pick up on, but the agents would, right?  Like how they make decisions, their readiness to take action, how much information they needed to get off the block, et cetera.  So, you know, the thing that I think about is like, do people need 100% of the information to take action?  Like that's a red flag. You're never going to get that. So anyways, like I think have some fun with agents that we could potentially use.  Anke might have some ideas too. So like maybe you guys can have a quick chat about it and brainstorm that.  But I think we could have a lot of fun with the AI. And honestly, I use it sometimes to like give me an assessment on conversations that I had.  Because I'm also an emotional person with, you know. My own upbringing and trauma and responses to different things. So it's really interesting, like, when I feed conversations into it, I'm like, what's your assessment on this, you know, and it was just like, like, so it might pick up on things from the sales process that I wouldn't have picked up on or, you know, so I think using the sales conversations could also bring some interesting things to light.

1:48:25 - Anke Badenhorst
  Yeah, love it.

1:48:29 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay, cool.

1:48:30 - Anke Badenhorst
  my action items is I am going to take everything we said and then summarize and pull out our exact mission, goals, overview, why we're here, what we're supposed to do.  I'm going to set up a new client brief, sort of an internal profile structure that we can start building out from, and then I'm going to set up a structure for the case studies as well.

1:48:55 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yep. And what's everybody going to do before our next session on Monday?

1:48:59 - Anke Badenhorst
  Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Watch the videos.

1:49:02 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, so Anke, you need to give everybody access to that. I dropped the link in my Athena notes for the specific one that I wanted.  But yeah, everybody watch that. I strongly recommend you just block out 30 minutes a day over the next five days because sometimes when you're watching, you want to pause and take some notes and that sort of thing.  So that gives you two and a half hours of time. If you do it starting tomorrow and Monday before our next call, take some notes, brainstorm some ideas, like what about our process is like good?  What could we take from that? And then when we come together next week, we're going to go through all of the copy templates and we're going to do the same thing that we did today where everybody's going to get an action that they need to take so that we're going to motor through this process with everybody individually contributing, right?

1:49:51 - Anke Badenhorst
  Yeah.

1:49:53 - Ida Badenhorst
  I'm excited.

1:49:54 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Are you guys excited?

1:49:56 - David R
  Yeah, I'm very excited.

1:49:58 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Cool. Were you worried?

1:50:00 - Ida Badenhorst
  I was worried you're going to take a look at the document and you're going to be like, oh my goodness, the kitchen, the health kitchen.

1:50:13 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  responsibility is that, though? Whose responsibility is that? Gordon Ramsay is yelling at me, like, you left the kitchen for too long, you know, that was my bad.  So I don't think anything that you guys did was wrong. You were doing what you were told, you know, and oftentimes what you were told was not what I thought you were being told.  That's on me. I should have been more active and I should have been more up in the kitchen and making sure that I was there for the briefings.  You know, if you think the way Michelin star restaurants run is that every day, the entire team, waitstaff, busboys, everyone, they all come together and they get a briefing from the head.  Chef on everything in the menu, exactly how it's prepared, what the specials are, what wine they should be pushing, right?

1:51:07 - Ida Badenhorst
  That happens every day, even if it's the same menu.

1:51:13 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So the way that they run and the way that they get their Michelin stars is making sure that their processes are like dialed in.  So like Michelin, like you don't know who it is. Like they just know that somebody's coming, but they don't know who it is or when they come.  But they'll like intentionally set silverware under their chair and see if they like spot it and pick it up and stuff.  You know, like it's like their processes have to be like so dialed in. And when you have those processes so dialed in, it allows you to focus on the parts that are important, which is the experience, right?  It's the quality, it's the experience because you're not worried about like, okay, how do we fold the napkins and what silverware did we give them at what point?  It's just like that second nature and just like. It's like running in the background and then you get to focus on making sure that the experience is amazing.  So that's what I love about processes and systems is like it's not doing the same thing all the time.  It's automating the  that you don't need to be thinking about every day so that you can layer on the things that you are uniquely good at, which is how are we making the owner's experience unlike anything they're going to get anywhere else?  How do we make their clients' experience unlike anything they're going to get anywhere else?

1:52:31 - Anke Badenhorst
  And how do we change both of their lives in the process?

1:52:35 - Ida Badenhorst
  Yeah. Yeah. It just creates a space where we know where we can move and where we can imagine and it just gives you freedom when you know where the boundaries are.

1:52:50 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, I mean, everyone apart from David knows my whole thing is like systems, processes, being in control means that you're not controllable, right?  I mean, It's freedom to me when you actually know what you're doing and when you have a process like that is freedom.  Right now, we don't have freedom because we're like at the behest of this, you know, baby that none of us know how to take care of or like where it came from.

1:53:15 - Ida Badenhorst
  Exactly.

1:53:17 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  It's crying. Like, I don't know what to do.

1:53:21 - Ida Badenhorst
  And everyone's talking a different message.

1:53:24 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, right? So, like, some people are, like, being stern with the baby. Other people are, like, let's do the, like, sleep with you method.  And, like, this thing isn't sleeping and nobody knows how to, like, treat it. So, yeah, it's, it's, this is going to be fun.

1:53:38 - Anke Badenhorst
  We're from the Titus to Miami's now.

1:53:49 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  I will say, when I looked at it, I was like, . Like, it's pretty phenomenal what you guys have been able to do without having a problem.  You know, like, without having the process dialed in. Because I was like, wow, there's so much that's, like, not defined in terms of who does what.  And it says a lot about how much accountability and follow through you all have is that you're figuring it out and you're making it happen, despite us not connecting all the tables and having a process for how it all works.  So I'm really, like, impressed with what you guys have been able to do. And I think just, like, doing this exercise, we're, I think by the end of the year, we'll make off-market more successful than on-market.  It's always been my vision, but, like, we didn't have a plan to put it into action. Now we're doing that.  And hopefully, just in time, because next Monday, what's happening?

1:54:47 - Ida Badenhorst
  Oh, it's the podcast.

1:54:49 - Anke Badenhorst
  Oh, , yeah.

1:54:51 - Ida Badenhorst
  I thought that was in April. Oh, wow. More clients.

1:54:59 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Oh, yeah. So Austin's out there like pounding the pavement, going to events, and then we're going to get hundreds of leads probably just from that podcast dropping.  And then the webinar coming after that on how to work with the BuySite advisor or search service, which nobody's ever put content in the book for.  So it's going to get real. So we've got to do a lot of work before all those clients start their searches, right?  Because we've got a temporary reprieve where we only have eight active clients right now. So we can build all this and then get it all in place so that when those clients start, got this  dialed in.  And hopefully turn some really great results out for the clients that are still with us. So, okay, good. This was awesome.  I feel super hyped up and energized from this session. So that tells me it was a good one. I hope you guys are feeling the same.  And I really appreciate your can-do positive attitudes and being up for doing these kinds of things. It just says a lot about all of you.  I'm so grateful to have you on the team because when you're up for experimenting and trying new things and making things better, it means that the whole company is getting better as a result of that.

1:56:22 - Anke Badenhorst
  So thank you. Very true. Thanks for taking the time.

1:56:27 - Ida Badenhorst
  Two hours of Athena time for us.

1:56:30 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  This is important. This is an important investment of my time. And I should have done it earlier, right? So yeah, I wish I had even more time to give to it.  I'm going to be making the time over the coming weeks. But yeah, so it's nice to be back on the deal team.

1:56:50 - Ida Badenhorst
  Yeah.

1:56:54 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay. Any questions? Is everybody clear on what needs to happen? Any concerns about getting this done in an...

1:57:00 - Ida Badenhorst
  Around everything else that you're working on. That sounds good.

1:57:04 - David R
  Yep. Sounds good. Great. Ending on time. I'll see you guys tomorrow. Yeah. Thank you. Thanks. Bye. Bye-bye. Bye.
