# First Write-Up Guide

## Your Roadmap for Evaluating Deals and Gaining Acquisition Experience

This document is your roadmap for navigating our write-up process, the phase where you begin reviewing and evaluating real business opportunities. It provides step-by-step guidance on what to do once you receive a write-up, how to approach broker conversations, and how to develop the mindset and skills of a confident buyer. Whether you're new to this or refining your approach, this guide will help you make the most of every opportunity and every conversation.

## Key Tips Before You Begin

### Always Engage Before Rejecting

Before you decide to pass on a deal, we strongly recommend having a conversation with both the broker and seller, even if you’re skeptical. Many clients discover key details or overcome concerns during conversations. Passing prematurely means missing a valuable learning opportunity (and sometimes, a hidden gem of a deal). We have even seen occasions in the past where a client initially wanted to reject a deal after reviewing the write-up, but we then encouraged them to continue pursuing the opportunity. They ended up finding aspects of the deal that really excited them and ultimately submitted an LOI\!

### Broker & Owner Calls Are a Training Ground

This isn’t just about finding the perfect deal, it's about gaining experience in asking good questions, building rapport with brokers & owners, and learning how to present yourself as a serious buyer. Every call helps you strengthen your positioning and negotiation skills, even if the deal doesn’t end up being a match.

### Active Participation is Critical

Your engagement directly influences our ability to serve you and your chances of securing a deal. Reviewing write-ups promptly (within 24 hours of receipt), signing NDAs quickly, and providing thoughtful feedback all accelerate your progress. The more responsive and involved you are, the more tailored and effective your deal flow will become.

# First Write-up Steps:

Welcome to the next stage of your acquisition journey\! This guide outlines exactly what happens when you receive your first write-up and how to work with us on deals going forward.

## Step 1: Read This Write-Up Process Document Thoroughly

When your first write-up is ready, you will receive a message with this document attached. Before doing anything else, we recommend reading through this entire document first to understand the full process. This will help you feel confident and prepared as you move through the next steps.

## Step 2: Sign the NDA and Buyer Profile during a call with the team, and review how to use a write-up.

You’ll be setting up a call with a member of our team, where they'll walk you through how to complete the NDA and Buyer Profile and how to use a Write-up. 

Each NDA Process differs with every broker, so the team may send you a PDF to be signed, or the broker will send you an NDA directly. Even if we already have an NDA in place with the broker, they will not share confidential information with us until you have signed your own NDA directly with them. We’ve made a commitment to them not to share sensitive details unless you have personally signed, and we take those relationships and promises seriously.. 

Detailed instructions on How to sign a NDA and what information to use is explained in these documents:  

* **[Let's Sign an NDA](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1L0KOtb_dC4wyciZC1Y7_UAuwyI00eQeJwJt084FBvPU/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.tg7sxomw35l5)**  
* **[Let's Complete a Buyer Profile](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tFqUIDhlhG2bSw5o88Oh5EV2BEAsPEFdUxAOJdb2ZP8/edit?tab=t.rw8kqbmpbsbf)**

The team will also demonstrate how to navigate and utilize a write-up, as well as how to access all the information within it.

**Action**: 

1. Book a Call with the team (we’ll instruct you how to do this in slack when it’s time)  
2. Sign the NDA & Buyer Profile on the Call  
3. Confirm that you understand the process of using a write-up and are ready to receive it.  
4. Schedule the Write-up Review Call for within the next 48 hours.  (You will not receive your Write-up before this NDA call has been completed and your Write-up Review call has been booked)

## Step 3: You'll receive the first write-up

After you’ve completed your NDA and Buyer Profile, you’ll receive your first write up. Please review the write-up provided and come prepared with any questions or points you'd like to discuss during your upcoming call with your advisor.

To help you get started, we’ve provided a [Broker Questions Document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1l74nSRRl_bwNlIFGG9QVGE6xRFddbqS9DLa3SdwhHKQ/preview?tab=t.0#heading=h.h0kdp9wkpu30) you can reference. From this list, select 10 questions you’d like to explore further: 

**Action:**

1. Review the write-up  
2. Select and finalize your 10 broker questions  
3. Post your selected questions in your Slack channel before your Write-up call with the advisor

## Step 4: Write-Up Review Call with Your Advisor

Your upcoming call with your advisor is a key step in preparing for broker outreach. During this session, you will:

* Review the full write-up in detail.  
* Discuss your questions and concerns.  
* Strategize your approach to the broker call. Your advisor will help you think through positioning, tone, and key talking points for your conversation with the broker.  
* Refine and finalize your broker questions.  
* Decide and agree on your ultimate goal and desired outcomes of the call.   
* Confirm readiness for the broker introduction. Let the analyst on the call know that you are ready to be introduced to the broker.

Use this time to get clarity on anything that feels uncertain and ensure you’re fully prepared for your next step in the process.

## Step 5: Broker Introduction

Once you've reviewed the write-up, received feedback from your Advisor on your talk track and are ready for an introduction, we’ll move forward with introducing you to the broker via email. This introduction will include your buyer profile and a brief background to position you effectively. 

**Note:** Once we’ve made an introduction, you will be the main point of contact for the broker and seller on the opportunity. We will support and advise you, but you’ll be in the driver’s seat on the deal going forward. 

**Action**: 

* Schedule your broker call ASAP to avoid losing momentum. Please respond to the email thread where you are introduced to the broker within 24 hours.    
* Notify us in your Slack channel once your broker meeting is scheduled so we can follow-up with you.

**Top Tip:** While broker communication will happen via email, please keep the AcquiMatch team CC’d on those threads. This helps us stay in the loop, track progress, and offer timely support if needed. **However, all internal conversations and updates should stay in Slack.** That’s our central hub for collaboration, and it ensures the right team member can respond quickly and keep everything organized.

## 

## Step 6: Attend the Broker Call

Never skip this step, even if you're unsure of whether an opportunity is a good fit for you. Every broker call is a valuable learning opportunity that strengthens your deal instincts and sharpens your positioning.

**Why This Step Matters:**

* **Clarify Key Assumptions:** Speaking directly with the broker or owner allows you to validate (or correct) assumptions you’ve made from the CIM or write-up.  
* **Uncover Insights Not in the CIM:** You’ll often learn details about the business that aren’t captured in the materials, things that can make or break your interest.  
* **Practice Buyer Positioning:** These calls help you build confidence, refine your narrative, and present yourself as a credible and qualified buyer to get access to the seller and move forward on an opportunity.

**Top Tip:** Always end the call with clear, agreed-upon next steps. Whether that means submitting an LOI, an IOI, or ideally moving forward to a seller call, momentum matters.

The goal is progress, not perfection. Every call builds your capability and confidence, making you better positioned for the next deal.

## 

## Step 7: Post-Call Feedback

Right after your broker call, hop into Slack and share your immediate thoughts. This helps us stay aligned and guide you through your next move.

**ACTION (in Slack):**

* **Tell us what happened**  
  * How did the call go?  
  * What questions were answered clearly, or left vague?  
  * What did you learn that wasn’t in the CIM?  
* **Share your takeaways**  
  * What did you like or dislike about the business or the broker?  
  * What concerns came up?  
  * What are you feeling excited or unsure about?  
* **Clarify next steps**  
  * Did you agree on a follow-up? Seller call?  
  * Is more information coming?


**Choose any format that works best for you:** Text, voice note, or a quick screen-recorded video, whatever helps you communicate clearly and quickly.

## Step 8: Navigating What Comes Next

After your broker call, the next step can vary depending on the broker’s process, the level of competition, and the stage of the deal. Some steps may happen in a different order than expected.

#### **Possible Scenarios:**

* **Seller Call as the Next Step:**  
  In most cases, you’ll move directly to a call with the owner. We’ll help you prepare your questions and positioning ahead of that conversation.

* **IOI Before Seller Call:**  
  Some brokers may request an IOI / LOI before granting access to the owner, especially if competition is high or they’re vetting serious buyers early.

* **Start Financial Modeling Early:**  
  If you’re strongly considering the deal or know you’ll need to submit an LOI soon, begin financial modeling as early as possible. It’ll give you a clearer sense of what you can offer and strengthen your positioning.

#### **Keep in Mind:**

* Broker processes differ, some are formal and structured, others are more flexible.  
* Timelines can shift depending on how many buyers are in the mix and how far along those other buyers are.  
* The more prepared you are (modeling, talk track, questions), the more confident and compelling you’ll be as a top choice. This comes with practice.

We’ll guide you based on what the broker asks for, just keep us updated in Slack as things develop, and we’ll support you every step of the way.

## Step 9: Preparing for the Owner Call

Once you’ve had a successful broker call and shown strong interest, the next goal is to get introduced to the owner. **Reminder:** The broker is just the gatekeeper, your real goal is to build rapport with the owner.

Positioning Yourself as the Ideal Buyer, Use the owner call to:

* **Build a connection** and establish trust  
* **Demonstrate your fit** for the business and your commitment to a smooth transition  
* **Understand their motivations** and show that you’re aligned with their goals  
* **Decide if you like the owner** and could see yourself continuing a relationship.   
* **If you’re seriously interested, suggest meeting in person**, this can go a long way in competitive situations

How to Prepare: Use the [**Owner Questions Resource**](https://www.notion.so/acquimatch/Seller-Meeting-Questions-Full-List-b8274e16bf804c2a81630e38c5db2b89?source=copy_link) and the [**Buyer-Seller Relationship Guide**](https://www.notion.so/acquimatch/Seller-Mindset-Context-Process-15ac367030c980c8b1c3f8a1bddab243?source=copy_link) to craft thoughtful, relevant questions

**Actions:**

* Post your 5–10 owner call questions in Slack ahead of the meeting so we can give you feedback  
* Let us know the **date and time of the call** so we can support you before and follow up after.

## 

## Step 10: Post-Call Feedback

Right after your owner call, hop into Slack and share your immediate thoughts. This helps us stay aligned and guide you through your next move.

**ACTION (in Slack):**

* **Tell us what happened**  
  * How did the call go?  
  * What questions were answered clearly, or left vague?  
  * What did you learn that wasn’t in the CIM?  
* **Share your takeaways**  
  * What did you like or dislike about the business or the owner?  
  * What concerns came up?  
  * What are you feeling excited or unsure about?  
* **Clarify next steps**  
  * Did you agree on a follow-up?  
  * Is more information coming?


Choose any format that works best for you: Text, voice note, or a quick screen-recorded video, whatever helps you communicate clearly and quickly.

## Step 11: Ready to move forward on this deal?

If the deal looks promising, head over to the [**Pre-LOI Document**](https://www.notion.so/acquimatch/Pre-LOI-Checklist-Process-153c367030c980ac802beafa00f36a65?source=copy_link) for your next steps. This document will walk you through valuation modeling, offer strategy, and letter drafting.

# Final Thoughts

### This Isn’t Just About the Deal, It’s About Building Your Dealmaking Muscles

Whether or not this particular opportunity is the one, the real value lies in the process.

Every time you review a write-up, engage with a broker, talk to an owner, or draft an IOI/LOI, you’re training your dealmaking muscles. You’re building confidence, sharpening instincts, and developing the skills that will set you apart when the right deal does come along.

*The people who go furthest are the ones who keep showing up, deal after deal, and take every opportunity to learn, adjust, and practice.*

Even when you’re unsure about a deal, go as far as you can. Each round makes you better at:

* Positioning yourself to brokers as ideal buyer

* Verifying your concerns to hone your deal instincts

* Navigating nerves

* Building real rapport

You're not just evaluating deals, you’re becoming a better buyer.

### Every Write-Up is a Development Opportunity

Our most successful clients are those who treat each deal not just as a pass/fail outcome, but as a learning lab. They:

* Engage quickly and openly in Slack  
* Embrace every step as a growth opportunity  
* Lean into feedback, even when it’s challenging

Each write-up is a chance to practice. Each conversation is a step toward mastery. And each next step, even if it doesn't end in an offer, is still forward motion.

### You’re Gaining Traction

This is your time to build momentum, sharpen your instincts, and move closer to a successful acquisition.
