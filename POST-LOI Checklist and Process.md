# How to Work with Us During the Closing Process {#how-to-work-with-us-during-the-closing-process}

Once your LOI is signed, our role will be to **support, advise, and guide** you as you navigate the process, but we will not be involved in direct negotiations on your behalf. Instead, we’ll provide insights, flag potential issues, help you stay on track, and help you make informed decisions.

## How We’ll Support You:

* **Weekly Pulse Meetings**: These meetings will help keep everything on track and ensure that you’re taking the right steps. We’ll discuss strategies for moving forward, recommend who you need to engage on your deal team, and help you refine your approach to any necessary renegotiations.

* **Review Lending Term Sheets**: We recommend that you have us review the SBA Loan term sheets as they come in. We can help assess the terms and make sure they align with the overall financing strategy.

* **Stay in the Loop**: To best support you, we ask that you **cc us on all communications** with your deal team and ask them to keep us in the loop. This allows us to stay informed and keep an eye on things so we can flag any concerns or issues before they become bigger problems.

* **Do Not Kill a Deal Without Talking to Us First**: If you’re feeling unsure about anything during the process, please reach out before making any major decisions, like backing out of a deal. We’re here to provide a second opinion and ensure you’re not missing something critical.

* **You’re the Project Manager**: While we’re here to support you, remember that **you are responsible for managing the project** and coordinating your deal team. We’ll help you stay organized and focused, but ultimately, keeping everything moving forward is your responsibility.

# Run Your Offer by a Lender and Get a Nod {#run-your-offer-by-a-lender-and-get-a-nod}

**We make the introductions.**  
Once you have a countersigned LOI, **our team will introduce you to SBA lenders** aligned to the deal’s profile and your goals. You’re always free to use any lender you choose, but using lenders we know tends to **speed underwriting** and **protect terms, as well as give you the highest probability of our fees being counted towards your equity injection.** Lenders that are not familiar with us may not see it that way, causing you to have to spend more on your equity injection. 

Make sure you make a good impression and make life easy for your lender contact. You should have done your modeling and have your proposed offer ready to go with your signed LOI. They like to see that you’ve done your homework (modeling).

**WATCH:** Check out this buyers club with Kevin, who with his wife bought 2 businesses and had to speak to many lenders in the process. [**These are their top tips**](https://www.notion.so/acquimatch/Kevin-Lindsay-Navigating-the-SBA-Lending-Process-175c367030c9800b98ebf29bd9ace5a0?source=copy_link)**.** 

**When you talk to your lender you’ll want to include:**

1. **The Outline of your offer** (that will explain your modeling) should include:

   1. Purchase Price

   2. SDE or EBITDA & Multiple you’re using

   3. What your equity injection will be

   4. Seller financing, the structure and terms if any

   5. Investor capital, structure and terms if any

   6. Working capital calculations and if you are including it in your offer price

   7. Estimation of deal expenses (i.e. our consultancy fee, legal, QofE, etc)

2. **Your financial modeling spreadsheet**

3. **The CIM**

4. **Financials you have available**

   1. Usually they want tax returns & P\&Ls are OK too. They will need more documents to get a term sheet like AR/AP, customer concentration, etc. Brokers typically do not want to share these docs until after LOI so you have to do the best you can with what’s available.

* **Action**: Ensure your lender gives a nod, confirming that your offer passes financing standards. While a formal term sheet isn’t necessary at this stage, the lender's feedback is essential to avoid structuring a deal that can’t be financed.

* **Pro Tip**: If the lender identifies any issues, make adjustments early. This will save time and reduce the risk of complications down the road. Beware of lenders making adjustments for their own benefit (we can help with this)

# Lending & Term Sheets {#lending-&-term-sheets}

Your next immediate priority is to secure a term sheet from a lender. We recommend you aim for at least 2 \- 3\. This gives you the confidence to move forward with your paid due diligence providers and may be required by the seller or broker as proof of financing. It also solidifies your position and secures full exclusivity, as you prove your funding capability.

## Key Considerations During the Lending Process:

1. **Get the Term Sheet(s) First:** During the LOI period, you’ll need to show that you have funding in place. It’s critical to obtain a **term sheet** (also called a conditional offer or pre-flight) as soon as possible. Even if one lender turns you down, that doesn’t necessarily mean the deal isn’t financeable, work with us to find and identify lenders who can meet your needs.

2. **Be Careful About Credit Pulls: Do not allow lenders to pull your credit** until you’re ready to sign a **commitment letter**. A commitment letter is more serious than a term sheet or pre-flight and will lock in your financing. However, credit pulls can negatively impact your credit score and your ability to get better terms, so avoid them until absolutely necessary.

   * **Tip**: Instead of letting lenders pull your credit, you can offer to send them your credit report. You can access your credit report for free once a year from sites like [**freecreditreport.com**](https://www.freecreditreport.com/).

3. **Get 2–3 Term Sheets:** We recommend securing **at least 2–3 term sheets** or conditional offers. Each lender can have widely varying fees, interest rates, and terms, so it’s important to compare options.

   * **Tip**: Don’t tell the lenders you’re shopping around for term sheets—this can irritate them. Quietly gather the offers so you can make an informed decision.

4. **Ask Lenders the Right Questions:** Whenever you talk to a lender, make sure you’re asking the following questions:

   * What is their process for reviewing deals like yours?

   * When do they pull credit?

   * What is their typical timeline for closing deals?

   * What’s their success rate with transactions of this size and type?

   * What is their experience with deals involving SBA financing or small investor contributions?

5. **Commitment Letter:** Once you’re ready to move forward with a lender, you’ll sign a **commitment letter**. This is a formal agreement that triggers the lender to move forward with financing your deal.

   * **Important**: **Do not sign more than one commitment letter**. Doing so will trigger multiple credit pulls and log your deal with the SBA, which could flag your deal across the system. Commitment letters are legally binding, so you want to be absolutely sure before signing.

   ## Action Items:

* **Obtain 2–3 term sheets** from different lenders to compare fees, interest rates, and terms.

* **Watch**: One of our favorite lenders talk about what she looks for in buyers during the process on this [Buyers Club](https://www.notion.so/acquimatch/Wendy-Gormley-Behind-the-SBA-Curtain-Live-Oak-Bank-1eec367030c98038bd81d11a3a0b379b?source=copy_link) episode.

# Seller Communication: Keeping the Deal on Track {#seller-communication:-keeping-the-deal-on-track}

One of the biggest risks to any deal is losing momentum. Time kills deals, and a lack of regular communication between you, the seller, and the broker can lead to delays, misunderstandings, and ultimately a deal falling apart. To keep things moving and maintain a healthy pace, regular updates and check-ins are essential.

## Weekly Pulse Meetings: A Key to Momentum

To keep the deal on track, we recommend setting a **weekly 'pulse' meeting** with the seller and broker as soon as you have a signed LOI. Here’s why this strategy works:

1. **Regular Updates on Both Sides:** These meetings provide an opportunity for both sides to share updates, discuss any new developments, and address small points or requests that may have come up during the week. Staying in regular contact reduces the risk of surprises later in the process.

2. **Accountability for Progress:** A standing meeting creates accountability on both sides. Knowing that there’s a dedicated time to check in helps ensure that everyone is staying on top of their tasks and deadlines, reducing the chance of things stalling or falling through the cracks.

3. **Involve Relevant Deal Team Members:** If needed, you can bring in members of your deal team (e.g., your lawyer, QofE provider, or lender) to address specific questions or issues. This keeps the process efficient and avoids miscommunications or delays caused by waiting for external input.

4. **Consistency and Convenience:** We recommend scheduling these meetings at the **same time every week**. Consistency reduces the likelihood of meetings being pushed or missed, and having a standing time keeps everyone aligned and prepared. If an in-person meeting is difficult, a **Zoom call** can make it easier for all parties to participate without logistical challenges.

   # 

   # Building Your Deal Team {#building-your-deal-team}

Once you’ve secured a term sheet, the next step is to assemble a strong team to guide you through due diligence. This team will ensure all aspects of the business are thoroughly evaluated and verified before closing, helping you avoid any surprises.

We love to make introductions to people we trust who have excellent experience, so ask your team to make introductions to future deal team members.

## Key Team Members & Next Steps:

1. **Sign with Your Legal Team:** Your lawyer will guide you through the legal due diligence process, ensuring that all contracts, agreements, and other legal documents are in order. If you haven’t already engaged a lawyer, now is the time to sign on with a firm that has experience in SMB M\&A.

2. **Engage a Quality of Earnings (QofE) Provider:** A QofE review verifies the seller’s financials, providing assurance that the earnings are accurately reported. While this is a significant expense, it’s crucial for identifying any financial red flags. Your QofE provider will also assist with key calculations like **working capital**, **maintenance capex**, and **forecasting**, helping you get a comprehensive understanding of the business’s financial health.

3. **Find a Corporate Real Estate Advisor:** Whether the business owns or **leases** its property, a real estate advisor is essential for evaluating its value. If the business owns real estate, they will assess the property's market value. If it leases, the advisor will review lease contracts, assess **market rent**, and identify any risks or unfavorable terms in the agreements.

   1. This is something you’ll want to find locally, as valuing and understanding your market will be essential. 

4. **Loop in Your Tax Advisor:** Your tax advisor should be someone familiar with your personal financial situation and experienced in M\&A. They will provide guidance on structuring the deal to minimize tax liabilities and help you navigate the tax implications of the acquisition.

5. **Engage an Insurance Due Diligence Provider:** Work with an insurance provider to review the current policies and determine if additional coverage is required. This service is **usually free of charge**, as insurance providers are incentivized to win your business.

6. **Consider Equipment/Inventory Appraisals:** If the business holds significant equipment or inventory, engaging a professional appraisal service ensures you’re aware of their actual value, helping you make informed decisions.

   **Recommendations**: We can provide recommendations for all of the above professionals, from legal teams to QofE providers. Your tax advisor should ideally be someone close to your personal financial situation, but if you need assistance finding one, we can also recommend experts with M\&A experience.

   

# Due Diligence Process {#due-diligence-process}

Due diligence is a critical phase where you and your deal team thoroughly assess the business to ensure everything is as represented. This process can be time-consuming, but by staying organized and following the right order of operations, you’ll not only streamline the process but also minimize costs and risk.

## Step-by-Step Guide for Due Diligence:

1. **Review the Due Diligence List with Your Deal Team:** We have a **[comprehensive due diligence list template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1f9aco7IbS2FPFyvvXqGLL99tlKljFlwWorYCFkMHPB8/copy)** to help you get started. Review this list with your deal team to ensure it covers everything you’ll need, from financial records to legal documents. It’s essential to tailor the list based on input from your team, especially your lender, QofE provider, and legal counsel, to make sure nothing is overlooked.

2. **Get Input from Your Entire Deal Team:** Make sure all members of your deal team, including your chosen lender, tell you what they need from the seller. This input is crucial for ensuring your due diligence is complete and aligned with what each expert requires in their specific area of expertise.

3. **Set a Meeting with the Seller and Broker:** Once your due diligence list is finalized, schedule a meeting with the seller and broker. During this meeting, you’ll walk them through the process, letting them know what documents and information are needed and setting clear expectations. Being organized and transparent at this stage is essential for maintaining seller cooperation.

   

# Prioritizing Due Diligence Phases: Why Order Matters {#prioritizing-due-diligence-phases:-why-order-matters}

When conducting due diligence, the **order** in which you tackle different areas is critical to saving time and money. The process should be approached in phases to ensure that potential deal killers are identified early, before you invest heavily in legal and other expensive evaluations.

## Start with Lender and Financial Due Diligence First

* **Lender Requirements**: Begin by focusing on the documents required by your lender. This will help confirm whether the deal is financeable and save time if issues arise with securing funding.

* **Financial Due Diligence**: After lender requirements, prioritize additional financial documents like cash flow statements, tax returns, and other financial records. Working closely with your QofE provider here is essential, as they can help identify discrepancies that could be deal breakers.

## Legal, Insurance, Real Estate, Inventory, and Equipment Appraisals

* **Legal**: Once financial and lender requirements are handled, move on to legal due diligence. This involves reviewing contracts, agreements, compliance documents, and more.

* **Insurance**: Tackle insurance due diligence to ensure all policies are up to date and adequate for the business’s needs. If not, this can often end up being a large adjustment to the SDE and should be negotiated if so (more on that below) 

* **Real Estate:** For real estate, whether the business owns or leases property—ensure all contracts are in order, and engage an expert to assess market value or any risks in lease agreements. If you are buying the real estate, you may need to take additional steps like getting environmental analysis. 

* **Inventory and Equipment Appraisals**: If the business has significant inventory or equipment, ensure you perform an appraisal to verify their value. This will prevent surprises about asset worth and make sure you're not overpaying for items that aren't accurately represented.

## Why This Order Saves You Money

By focusing first on **lender requirements** and **financial due diligence**, you’re tackling the highest-risk areas upfront. If a deal killer arises during financing or financial reviews, you can potentially save significant costs by avoiding extensive legal work, insurance reviews, real estate evaluations, and asset appraisals—areas that are often more expensive.

## DD top tips

* **Spend a Day in the Business:** If you haven’t already, it’s highly recommended to spend a day in the life of the seller or within the business itself. If the seller is concerned about employees finding out about the sale (which is common), you can pose as an employee or consultant to observe the business operations. This approach gives you invaluable insights into the day-to-day workings, culture, and challenges of the business.

* **Get Industry-Specific Expertise:** It’s highly recommended to bring in someone who knows the industry of the business you’re buying. They can provide insights into specific documents, risks, or operational details you might not otherwise know to request. This will help you uncover potential issues that are unique to that industry and make more informed decisions.

# Navigating Deal Killers and Deal Adjustments {#navigating-deal-killers-and-deal-adjustments}

During the due diligence process, you're looking for two main things: **deal killers** and **deal adjustments**. Understanding how to handle both is key to ensuring the deal moves forward smoothly, or knowing when to walk away.

## Deal Killers

Deal killers are significant issues that would make you decide not to proceed with the acquisition. These typically include:

* Major misrepresentations by the seller

* Evidence of fraud

* Inability to secure financing or meet lender requirements

* Legal or regulatory issues that could affect the business’s viability

These are red flags that could cause the deal to fall apart, and they must be identified as early as possible in the due diligence process.

## 

## Deal Adjustments

In contrast, deal adjustments are issues that don’t necessarily break the deal but will require renegotiation before moving forward. Examples include:

* The **QofE team** finds discrepancies in **SDE (Seller’s Discretionary Earnings)** or **working capital**.

* The **insurance team** discovers inadequate coverage or a substantial increase in policy premiums is needed.

* **Real estate issues** like an increase in rent or unfavorable lease terms.

* Differences in the value of **equipment** or inventory that don't align with what was presented.

These issues won’t kill the deal but will need to be renegotiated **before the Purchase Agreement (PA) is drafted**.

## 

## How to Navigate These Issues Effectively

1. **Track All Adjustments**  
   As each of these issues arises during due diligence, keep a running list of all the potential adjustments that need to be made. This list will help you stay organized and ensure you don’t overlook any critical points.

2. **Plan a Single Renegotiation Discussion**  
   Rather than negotiating each issue as it comes up, it’s more effective to wait until you’ve identified all the adjustments and then address them all at once. This approach allows you to prioritize the most important issues, negotiate more effectively, and prevent **deal/negotiation fatigue**—which can jeopardize the deal.

   * **Prioritization**: Focus on what's most important to you (e.g., financing adjustments, insurance coverage) and identify which points are more flexible or negotiable.

   * **Flexibility**: Be prepared to give on smaller issues if it helps secure more critical adjustments.

3. **Do the Renegotiation In Person** 

   Whenever possible, we recommend handling renegotiations **in person**. This allows for clearer communication, builds rapport, and can lead to more favorable outcomes for both parties.

# Wrapping It All Up: Closing the Deal {#wrapping-it-all-up:-closing-the-deal}

Once the lender has approved your financing, due diligence has gone smoothly, and any necessary renegotiations have been agreed upon, the next step is to finalize everything in a **Purchase Agreement (PA)**. The PA is the final, legally binding contract that outlines the terms of the sale and seals the deal.

This is a **light overview** of the process to give you a general sense of what to expect, but please verify the details with your deal team as every transaction is unique.

### 1\. Drafting and Reviewing the Purchase Agreement (PA)

* **Work with Your Lawyer**: Your lawyer will draft or review the PA, which will incorporate everything you’ve negotiated—final purchase price, financing terms, seller financing, working capital adjustments, and other agreed-upon items like equipment value or inventory changes.

* **Final Protections**: The PA should include representations and warranties to protect you from undisclosed liabilities or issues that could arise post-sale (e.g., debts, taxes, or legal disputes).

### 2\. Lender’s Final Sign-Off

* **Confirm SBA Approval**: The lender will conduct a final review to ensure all conditions are met and that the financing terms align with SBA guidelines.

* **Escrow Process**: The funds are typically transferred through an escrow account. The escrow agent holds the funds and releases them once all closing conditions are satisfied.

### 3\. Final Due Diligence Check

* **Verify Closing Conditions**: Double-check that all due diligence items, like clear title to assets, insurance coverage, and lease transfers, are satisfied before signing the PA.

* **Bill of Sale & Assignment of Assets**: Your lawyer will finalize documentation to transfer ownership, including the Bill of Sale and any Assignment of Assets agreements.

* **Final Inventory Count**: Conduct a final inventory count to verify the value of inventory being transferred as part of the sale. This is essential for confirming that what was agreed upon in the PA matches what’s actually being transferred.

### 4\. Closing Day

* **Closing Meeting**: There will likely be a formal closing meeting, which can be held in person or via Zoom. This will involve you, the seller, attorneys, and possibly your lender.

* **Final Payments**: The escrow agent will release the funds, and your down payment and loan funds will be disbursed. Any seller financing arrangements will be finalized at this point.

* **Sign Closing Documents**: All parties will sign the necessary agreements, including the PA and loan documents.

### 5\. Post-Closing Responsibilities

* **Transition Plan**: If the seller is staying on for a transition period, make sure there’s a clear plan in place to ensure a smooth handover.

* **Ongoing SBA Compliance**: You may have post-closing obligations, such as submitting financials to the lender or maintaining required insurance levels.

* **Transfer of Employees**: Ensure that all employment agreements or handovers with key personnel are completed smoothly.

### 6\. Wrapping Up Seller Obligations

* **Earnouts and Escrowed Funds**: If any funds are held in escrow (e.g., for working capital adjustments), make sure you understand the terms and timelines for releasing them.

* **Release of Liens**: Confirm that any liens or debts have been cleared before the final release of funds.
