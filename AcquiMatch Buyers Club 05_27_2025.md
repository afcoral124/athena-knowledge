# AcquiMatch Buyers Club 05/27/2025

[00:00:00] 

**Athena:** Well, so, uh, I think it may just be the two of you, 'cause a lot of folks are off for the, uh, holiday.

So wanted to put it out to both of you. Like what? If anything would be really helpful to you or would you like to time back, since we're meeting individually tomorrow, do some modeling or talk about, you know, any of the deal stuff that you have going on, but don't wanna need this that keep you on? If there's nothing that would be useful to talk through to since we're meeting tomorrow.

**Justin:** Yeah, I mean the, the only thing I've.

This won't be qualified, and so I know what I know what.

Back. I mean, he kept saying like, before we go too far, like, are you qualified? Basically, [00:01:00] like how we pay for this. Um, you know, and I, I politely, you know, said, well, updated financials at least, but because we don't even have, you know, 20, 20 fours are listed at the approximate, which means had been updated.

And he says, oh yeah, I need to update that. That's just because took off,

didn't the wanted kind. So I update that and then I asked for 25, like year to date if he has it too. So he's working on that. And then he said, yeah, but you know, before we kind of do seller meeting and all that stuff, can you find out how you would pay for this? So it was like, all right, so that this is a curve ball.

I hadn't met with one yet. That flat out said like, this is not an SBA opportunity. 

**Athena:** Yeah. Gotcha. Okay. Which, uh, deal is this specifically? 

**Justin:** It's called work lodge. 

**Athena:** Okay. Doesn't look like it got pinned in your channel, so gimme two seconds to find it. 

**Justin:** Oh, sure, sure, sure.[00:02:00] 

**Athena:** Dokey. Yep. Found it. Okay. Um, and then deal size is, 

**Justin:** it's around a million s.

I mean, they're asking, there's, there's no list price even, you know, Luke asked about the whisper and he said four, but I, I wouldn't offer four. Right. But that's, uh, that's the, the range right now. And, and they said that they've fallen out. They, they know or he, the broker feels 95% sure it's not gonna qualify for.

Interested parties in the past and they've tried to go SBA and they've been denied each time. Uh, I guess because of the nature of the business itself, there's it's asset light. Um, you know, it's basically an arbitrage, uh, an an office commercial space arbitrage business. Um, so they'd own the real [00:03:00] estate.

Um, they're leasing and then subleasing effectively with remote coworking space. And so he said that they, he might've talked to one who was thinking, a lender who was thinking about it, but like sounded no. So he's like, look, if you all have like connections we don't have, or you know, know people who are more open-minded because maybe let us know 'cause we're very, he'd be very interested if we come to.

A lender who's already kind of signed off on willing to lend on this. And it sounds like that would move a perspective buyer to the top of the chain because Right. They're struggling finding anybody who can lend on it. 

**Athena:** Yeah. And they're in the um, they're in the SBA range, so unless they find a strategic, it's very unlikely they'll find a.[00:04:00] 

**Justin:** They said they tried strategic and they didn't get the response they wanted in the market, so they just kind of, they pulled, I mean, they went off market. They pulled it off. He's like, I wasn't even sure how Luke found me. He's like, because we don't, we're not actively marketing this. It might have been an old lead from somewhere, or you know, a dormant page or whatever.

He goes, so you're the only one we're even talking to right now because we kind of weren't considering any buyers at the moment. 

**Athena:** This might. Um, so it's, it's, it's an air ball, so it's basically a service business. Like they find office spaces for rent and then they match them to people. 

**Justin:** They, they, they sub It's WeWork, it's a private WeWork.

Okay. That's all. It's, yeah. And so they, yeah, they, they have two locations that they've had for a while. I mean, they've been in business for over a, yeah. 

**Athena:** Um, 

**Justin:** and so they've got two locations more to the luxury, like higher end. Rent or higher end business that would sub sublease or want a coworking space or whatever.[00:05:00] 

Um, and, uh, but that's all they do. So they've got long-term fixed leases, uh, which is good. Their costs are fixed, so any additional occupancy you can increase, it's all upside because the, you don't get increased expenses with it, which I kind of, that's a cool model. Airbnb, it's short rentals, which is my world.

Yeah. Commercial office instead of private. 

**Athena:** Right. Okay. So the, the only thing then is not, not necessarily the financials or any performance issues, it's the fact that it's an airball and, and they would be uncollateralized by the sounds of it. 

**Justin:** I mean, yeah. For me there's a bit of a performance because they've had dips, like it's been a steady downtrend in top line revenue mm-hmm.

For the couple years running. So I would, I mean, I'd still like there be performance notes.

Their, their numbers, their revenue numbers in 2024 are pretty much on par with like 21, 20 20 and [00:06:00] 2021. So 22 was a big uptick. 23 little downtrend, 24 downtrend, but 24 is just normalized back to 2020 and 2021 numbers. So it's, they haven't gone below that. They're just back like right bell curve now.

It's still a healthy, I mean, the business has healthy margins, so I mean, it's not, I'm not against it. I mean, obviously again, I wanna protect against further downside, but, um, I, I'm interested in it if, but the lending, they just, they're struggling finding anybody who can lend on it. 

**Athena:** So what I would do is I would ask and if he could tell you what lenders have turned it down so we can compare if, if there's any that we have that we could potentially speak to about it.

It's a little bit small for private debt, unless it's in one of their areas. The [00:07:00] the folks that I. They have specific funds for specific areas. And I know when I was looking at Harlingen, they were really excited about that, but I don't know if the Woodlands would qualify as like a, an area that needs some, some help.

So, um, I forget what they call it. It was like a,

uh, I'll, I'll think of it, but yeah, maybe ask him what, um. What lenders that they've spoken to already, because there's, there's 4,000 SBA lenders. 

**Justin:** Yeah. Well, and that's what I was thinking. I was thinking back to like Kevin's situation, you know, where he was like they had to poke around several before somebody was like, all right, you know, we can put this on the ledger.

And maybe that's the similar story. It's like having a conversation. Somebody might be like, yeah, we can do that. 

**Athena:** Yeah. Well, yeah, then I. Hey, can you tell me who you've spoken to? Because we actually have a [00:08:00] relationship with quite a few and some that are a lot less risk averse than others. So let's start there.

Who have you spoken to? Can you get me the most up to date financials? And let me go have a few conversations to see if anyone on my side bites. Yeah, because it is it, it's a good fit for you from a like skillset interest. Perspective too, so it'd be worth a couple more conversations. Um, 

**Justin:** and he, he, they 

**Athena:** must be speaking to banks that aren't cash flow lender.

Like, that's interesting. 

**Justin:** Yeah. I don't know. I mean, it's, I, I mean, my guess is yeah, that because there's so asset light, there's nothing to collateralize. So, you know, sba,

how are.

In the worst case area where something goes south, they're like, how do we recoup? There's nothing we can liquidate. They don't own nothing. They own like 40 grand in furniture. That's it. Yeah. But 

**Athena:** that, that's all [00:09:00] service-based businesses. So that's the thing. Yeah, I guess that's true. He's must be true. Yeah.

I mean there's, there's lenders that are like legitimately just cash flow lenders, so it doesn't matter if there's assets in the business or not. Yeah. So I'm wondering if he's gonna let, like I was looking at, it's Sunbelt, you know, so if he's always done, say. Like depending on what he is represented in the past, if he's represented businesses that had assets and he went to lenders that were not cashflow lenders and they needed those assets in the business because that, that's one.

One of the things that happened to me in my property management deal that I like. My big one that I lost is I was speaking to a lender that was not a cashflow letter. Yeah. Which is why he ended up coming up with the structure that he came up with, which put me at a huge disadvantage. But there's other lenders that their cash flow all day long, that's all they do.

They don't care if there's assets in business. They care about the past performance. So, yeah. Um, I, I know a few, I mean, live Oak being one of 'em, right? Like all they are is an sba, SBA [00:10:00] lender, they lend on cashflow. There's other lenders that I could put you in touch with, um, that are cashflow lenders. So let's find out who he's spoken to first.

And if you can get the most UpToDate financials and then thinking Tooney might be an interesting one too. 'cause they send seem to be a lot more, um, they're not nearly as conservative as some of the bigger ones. 

**Justin:** Yeah. Cool. All right. Yeah, I can do that. I'll, uh, I'll ping him and he. Uh, amenable to, you know, help wanting this to move.

I mean, again, he seemed kind of pleasantly surprised. We even found them and we're talking and so he is like, oh, wow, we've got somebody, okay. Team, team, good at 

**Athena:** teams, teams finding all different kinds of rocks to like unearth now. 

**Justin:** It was fun. He cool? I was like, yeah, I asked him sort of asking some question, you know, typical.

Well, uh, I, I would just like to get you front of the, because these are good questions, like he hasn't told me too much. Uh, so let's just get front. But also, how are you gonna for this, [00:11:00] we'll figure it out outta Yeah, 

**Athena:** yeah. Economic development area. That was, that was the phrase I was trying to. I couldn't.

Yeah, yeah, yeah. Um, I'll, I'll check with him again real quick. If, if The Woodlands or Texas is, is one of those on the private debt side, the, and there's a ton of private debt providers, but usually you need to go north of 10 million. Yeah. But there's one particular that I know that will go smaller on, on areas that are within their economic development area.

So I know Harlingen and like South Texas was, but I don't know 

**Justin:** if the. A lot of people look there for that development potential, but yeah, Woodland isn't necessarily hurting. They're not, uh, yeah, they're kind of already at maturation. 

**Athena:** Yeah, it's beautiful up there. 

**Justin:** We, we 

**Athena:** went the, the Texas Association of Business Brokers Conference was up there last year, so that was my first Woodlands experience, but it was stunning.

Um, yeah.[00:12:00] 

There's a lot of reasons why a business might not be SBA qualified. So first thing we need to dig into is like, why is the broker saying it that if it's not SBA qualified, sometimes it'll be things like, oh, a broker or the owner did something on their tax returns that it shows there's no profit, there's no way to add things back to, to give it profit because SBA is like.

They lend off tax returns. Mm-hmm. So for example, like the, um, the deal that we were looking at with Chris was an interesting, like this, this roofing business, and it didn't qualify because they paid themselves commissions and like commissions was like an expense line item that wasn't taxed. As opposed to like as an owner, there's two ways that we can get paid distributions and payroll.

Oh, yeah. And those are both those, those are both recorded differently on the tax return. So if an [00:13:00] owner's like burying their payment in an actual business expense, it's very hard to justify that as a something when, when somebody, when a broker says, oh, it's not SBA qualified, it's like, well, is it because the tax returns.

Don't show the profit that we need in order to make it a, a, you know, cashflow lendable business. Yeah. Is it because there's something in there that a lender was like, I don't like this, you know, like, like customer concentration? Well, we know that there's ways to overcome that with structuring, and maybe whoever was looking at it before didn't structure it advantageously enough or speak to enough lenders.

Or like in this situation, it sounds like he's spoken to lenders that want assets in the business. 

**Justin:** Um, he just mentioned that he also mentioned, I mean he mentioned that as just like a, a bullet. Another bullet was he said that the type of business, so it sounded like they were adverse to. It effectively arbitrage.

I mean, he's, he's leasing a space and then [00:14:00] leasing it out again, subleasing it to tenants. So maybe the, just the, whoever he talked with, like, we don't, we don't like that nature of that business. I. 

**Athena:** To me that's like marketing and sales. It's no different than a subcontracting business, you know? So it's like, well, 

**Justin:** that's why I was confused.

Yeah. I mean, that's why I didn't understand why that would be so unpalatable for somebody, because it's, it's like any GC or any, you know, you're going home services, if they sub out anything. Effectively what they're doing too, they're a marketing channel, like a, a business development channel, and then they sub out the actual work that's so common.

We all know that's incredibly common in lots of services businesses. So, 

**Athena:** um, and it's a, a very good business model if somebody's figured out something that, that. You know, like generates customers and recurring revenue too, like has contracts and these tenants, that's the other thing. I mean, some of them are 

**Justin:** month to month, but some of them are annualized, like leases effectively.

And I'm like, that's amazing. I mean, you can get, you know, a tenant to sign 12 months, that's 12 [00:15:00] months of guaranteed revenue, you know? 

**Athena:** Yeah. Okay. We'll circle back, have those questions, uh, ask him who the lenders were and then, uh, if you get an answer before a call tomorrow, like if you do that today, then maybe you can get a before I'll shoot them, um, or maybe to try to get 'em on the phone too.

And then that way we can use our time tomorrow to talk through some alternatives if, if there are folks that aren't our people. 

**Justin:** Yeah, that sounds 

**Athena:** good. Nice. Cool. Um. And then, uh, yeah, so, and then the financial models and everything that I sent over. Those all made sense, hopefully. Yeah. Yeah. 

**Justin:** Yeah. That was good stuff.

Thanks again. Yeah, that was very helpful. 

**Athena:** No worries. Um, cool. Gil, would there be anything worthwhile to talk through today? You wanna save our discussions till tomorrow? What would be good for you? 

**Gil:** Let's get until tomorrow, we can talk about the new opportunity that was put in front of me [00:16:00] and I can update you after a few conversations I had today about what we talked about earlier, earlier this morning.

So, yeah. Okay. 

**Athena:** Awesome. Um, something that I'll share with Justin, just a tool that I, I shared with Gil earlier today is a, it, I call it the back against the wall brainstorm. So like, when. An issue comes up that it feels like it's insurmountable, then I will do what I call a back against the wall brainstorm.

So when you feel like your back's against the wall and you have to fight out, right, and it's like your option is not to like stop. We gotta figure out something. So then. I'll just go wild with like brainstorming potential solutions and it's like you gotta turn off the part of your brain that says it's too expensive or that's not gonna be possible, or whatever, and you just literally do the creative side of what are all the potential solutions that I could come up with.

Like I. For an example here, it's like, well, if I couldn't find deals for somebody, what are all the possible options? [00:17:00] Uh, I could go knock door to door. I could hire college students to go stand on the corner and wave signs. I, you know, that works. 

**Justin:** Today, you're onto something with that, like. 

**Athena:** Well, we, we actually do, we, we have like a college program and, and on the radar, like, could we do something like.

Or like Mike with this, sell me your towing business t-shirts and just yeah, make an 

**Justin:** experiential marketing campaign. You know, where it's like it goes viral and social because it's great for that stuff. 

**Athena:** Right. Well, so like it's not about like the feasibility of it, it's just like all the different ideas of things that you can come up with.

So like. In, in the deal process, even on deals we love, there's gonna be things that come up that feel like deal breakers. And I like using this brainstorming tool to, to see is it genuinely, like, is there no solutions that I can come up with that that would make this okay? Yeah. If, if we like everything else despite this one thing.

[00:18:00] And it's a really great tool for when you're a business owner too, because you don't have the option to like not. Not show up for your business. So yeah, sometimes things come up and like I've just trained my brain now that, that I will, I don't take no for an answer. If somebody comes back and says like, no lending, and I'm like, well somebody else will do it.

Or what if we structure it this way or whatever. And it just gets that part of your brain thinking of like through solutions and what else? And if I literally have to fight my way out of this. What are all the options and ways that I could do that? Or what are all the tools that I could try to draw on to fix this problem?

Um, so I think I've talked about it before with y'all, but I, I talked about it with Gil and I was like, that's a good thing to remind people about. It's just, you know, set a timer for 15 minutes, get a piece of paper out and just write. Solution, solution, solution, solution, solution. And then when the timer goes off, then you can go through and be like, well, what's possible here?

What would the [00:19:00] cost of these be? Or what, you know, um, like there might be some crazy things on there that it's like, well, I could do this in the future if, if this, or maybe there's some realistic ones on there. So, um. Thought that was a useful tool to share. But other than that, sounds like maybe worth giving y'all your time back instead of trying to keep you out here.

And yeah, talk about this since I'm gonna see you tomorrow. Uh, just a reminder, Thursday, uh, you're gonna have, um, Henry come on and he's gonna talk about investment into SBA funded deals. Specifically. He is, um. A phenomenal resource. Justin, you know him personally? Yeah. He hosts the club, so he is gonna be breaking down.

Uh, Gil, he hosts a local meetup here in Austin, so he is been a very active member of the community. Um, I really like his way of investing into searchers, so he's gonna be coming on and kind of doing a 1 0 1. So you all can understand, well, what does it look [00:20:00] like if I were to bring an investor in on my SBA deal and what are the terms and what's the governance look like?

And I'm gonna grill him hard on some stuff. But we're also gonna talk about difference between what his thesis might be and just generalities for investment as well. So he's gonna have his specific thesis that he looks for, um. And then, uh, other investors will have different things. So just knowing the differences between like, what's hims just like with lenders, right?

Like every lender has their, their preferences. So that'll be a really fun one on Thursday. Uh, next Thursday is gonna be Denise Montenegro. Um, she bought a business. In Dallas with her wife, and there was all sorts of problems that talk about back against the Walgreens storms. Like these ladies have been like fighting through this for over a year.

It was unbelievable. I don't wanna spoil the surprise, but essentially they, they, they got through it and they're now, you know. Owners of a profitable [00:21:00] business, um, despite all odds saying that they shouldn't be. Uh, and then the following Thursday just confirmed. Um, Elliot Holland, he's pretty famous in the diligence.

World. Uh, he's been providing diligence services to searchers, I think for like 15 years now. Um, so he's seen just about everything. I really love his content on social media 'cause he's kind of been going up against the influencers, um, and all of them. So he's gonna be doing, uh, a talk on diligence, but we're gonna be talking about different things than we've covered in the past.

So that will be a really good one too. So we've got some good. Buyers clubs, uh, on deck for future Thursday sessions. And then Tuesday we'll have more deals and folks to talk through when everybody's back from their vacations. 

**Justin:** Awesome. Nice. Sounds good. Cool. Good lineup. 

**Athena:** Yeah, I'm excited more to come too.

Um. Also we're gonna be hosting a [00:22:00] webinar on acquiring mine on June 5th. Uh, not that any of you need to come 'cause you're already clients, it's how to work with a buy side advisor. But, um, spread the word if, if you know anyone that might wanna learn about that. Um, very cool. Yeah. So. Yeah, very excited.

Nervous a little bit, but should be fun. 

**Justin:** Very good, very good. Spread the words, spread the gospel on, you know, high profile platforms in the space. It's great. 

**Athena:** Yeah, so awesome. Well thanks both. I'll see you tomorrow morning. Um, yeah, and looking forward to diving a little deeper on your deals and Justin, hopefully you can get some answers.

'cause uh, that sounds like a fun one to explore actually. Yeah. Especially when there's no competition on it because it seems like. Sometimes he to the hidden gems, like people are like, oh, challenge Yeah. Forward. You know? 

**Justin:** Yeah. That, that's what I thought about this. I was like, I liked it. It's, you know, he's like, oh, we're excited to talk to you because like we didn't know anybody who was interested right now and whatever.

It's a 

**Athena:** really healthy SCE if that checks out. 

**Justin:** Well, yeah, I [00:23:00] mean, yeah, exactly. It, I mean it's, you know, the whisper is at, at route a fourex, but, you know, I would evaluate even less and I think they would take it, you know, if, uh, so yeah, because 

**Athena:** they, they don't even think it's fundable right now. They're in the sba, they've had funded spot two 

**Justin:** years, consecutive declining revenue.

It's like all of the makings for like what could still be LB business. It's still, but um, maybe at a decent valuation. Decent acquisition price. And then, yeah, I mean successful, successful run. So this is fun and it's run by an influencer, the guy who owns. He is like got a name, well, a small name, but he is got a name.

He is like all over, over social it tribe to be. So I'm like, all right. And I was looking at some as content. Interesting dude. Alright. Fascinating 

**Athena:** fun. That sounds fun. 

**Justin:** Yeah, so we'll see. But he's in Houston, uh, and then one of the other ops I've got is also based in Houston. So I'm trying to see if I can make a market trip and just visit both of them.

So.

**Athena:** Cool. Well, [00:24:00] I'm excited to how it goes. Hopefully we get some answers for tomorrow and then, um, I'll see you all tomorrow. Enjoy having a half an hour in your day. 

**Justin:** Likewise.
