SMB (Small and Medium-Sized Business):
Think of SMBs as businesses that fall between small, family-owned shops and massive corporations. These are the types of businesses you'd likely be looking at as a first-time buyer. Whether it's a local plumbing company or a regional distribution business, SMBs typically generate revenue of under $50 million a year—perfect for an acquisition.

ETA (Entrepreneurship Through Acquisition):
If you’ve ever dreamed of owning a business but don’t want to start one from scratch, ETA is the model for you. With this approach, you buy an existing, profitable SMB. Instead of worrying about building a business from the ground up, you can focus on scaling what’s already working.

Searcher:
As a first-time buyer, you’re referred to as a “searcher”—someone actively looking to acquire the right SMB. The key to your search is defining your deal box—a clear set of criteria based not only on industry, location, and profit but also on your personal skill set, aspirations, and long-term goals. This ensures that you're not just finding any business, but one that’s a great fit for you. You’ll explore both on-market (broker-listed) and off-market (direct) deals. While on-market deals are usually more straightforward with sellers who are ready to sell and brokers who help facilitate the process, off-market deals can offer hidden gems but require more time, effort, and experience to close successfully. Working with experienced advisors, like AcquiMatch, can help you navigate these channels and improve your chances of success.

Deal Box:
Your "deal box" is like your personal checklist for the kind of business you want to buy. While most first-time buyers think of criteria like industry, location, and profit, AcquiMatch goes beyond that. We help you define a deal box that aligns with you—your skill set, aspirations, and personal goals. Sure, finding a profitable business is key, but we also ensure the business aligns with your long-term vision and lifestyle.

On/Off Market:
On-Market: Businesses listed through brokers. One of the biggest advantages of on-market deals is that the seller is usually ready to sell now, and there's an incentivized intermediary (the broker) who wants to get the deal done. Brokers can help push the process forward, making it easier to negotiate, gather information, and move toward closing with fewer delays. It's a more straightforward option for first-time buyers.
Off-Market: These are businesses not officially listed for sale, often approached directly by the buyer. While off-market deals can uncover hidden gems with less competition, they require considerably more legwork. If you’re unfamiliar with the process, it can spook owners—especially first-time sellers who may not understand the steps. Many first-time buyers struggle to close off-market deals because they lack experience in M&A (Mergers and Acquisitions) and stewarding an owner through the process. It’s a great channel, but you’ll want experience or an advisor like AcquiMatch to help you navigate it, ensuring you can close successfully without overwhelming the seller or missing key steps in the acquisition.

SBA (Small Business Administration) Loans:
An SBA 7a loan is one of the most common ways to finance an SMB purchase. It’s a government-backed loan that allows you to buy a business with a lower cash requirement upfront. Typically, you’ll need at least 10% down as your equity injection (see definition below), but this can vary depending on how creatively the deal is structured. For instance, you could reduce your cash requirement with seller financing (where the seller acts as a lender) or by bringing in outside investor capital. The SBA 7a program has a loan limit of $5 million, though this can be extended through pari passu arrangements (see definition below) with other lenders if more financing is needed.
If your acquisition involves real estate, the SBA 504 program might offer better terms for financing the property portion, including longer amortization periods.

Equity Injection:
In the context of SBA loans, the equity injection refers to the cash down payment you must provide to secure the loan, usually around 10% of the total purchase price. This is your personal investment in the deal, demonstrating your commitment to the lender. The amount can sometimes be negotiated or reduced if creative financing structures—such as seller financing or bringing in investors—are used.

Pari Passu:
In SBA financing, pari passu refers to the same lender providing two separate loans with the same repayment terms (such as interest rate and structure), even though one of them is guaranteed by the SBA and the other is not. The SBA typically guarantees 75-85% of the first loan (up to $5 million). If the total deal requires more than that, the lender may issue an additional loan on the same terms but with no SBA backing. This second loan may require more equity injection or other security measures to cover the lender's risk since it is not government-guaranteed.

EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization):
This is a fancy way of saying “how much money the business makes before certain expenses.” As a first-time buyer, you’ll hear this term a lot when assessing a business's financials. Banks and investors use EBITDA to understand the business’s cash flow and whether it can support loan repayments and operational costs.

SDE (Seller Discretionary Earnings):
For most SMBs, SDE is the key financial number to focus on. SDE is essentially EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization) plus add-backs. It represents the total income the owner makes from the business, including their salary and discretionary expenses. As a first-time buyer, this number is crucial because it helps you understand whether the business generates enough income to cover debt payments, pay expenses, and still leave enough for you to pay yourself. Focusing on a business with a solid SDE ensures the business is sustainable and worth the investment.

Add-Backs:
Add-backs are expenses that the current owner runs through the business but are not necessary for its ongoing operation. These could include personal benefits like a company car, travel, or other perks. By adding these back to the business’s financials, you get a clearer picture of the company’s actual profitability. For buyers, it’s important to understand the add-backs when calculating SDE because it gives you a more accurate sense of what the business could generate under new ownership.

CIM (Confidential Information Memorandum):
This is an overview document provided by the seller or broker that gives you a snapshot of the business for sale, including its financials, operations, and market position. CIMs can vary widely—some are thorough, while others may lack detail. As a first-time buyer, this document helps you decide if the business is an opportunity worth pursuing, but don’t rely on it as the final word. Brokers aren’t marketers, and you could miss hidden gems if you eliminate a business based on the CIM alone, assuming there are no glaring issues. You’ll want to be vigilant in your review, but also understand that CIMs come in all shapes and sizes, so deeper due diligence is often required before making a decision.

LOI (Letter of Intent):
When you find a business you want to buy, you’ll submit an LOI to the seller. This document outlines your offer and the basic terms, like price and timeline. While an LOI is non-binding in terms of committing you to buy the business, there are some parts that are binding, like exclusivity (preventing the seller from negotiating with others) and confidentiality (protecting sensitive business information). There are also other important elements in an LOI, such as your proposed financial offer and structure, transition period, and type of sale (asset vs. stock sale). Not getting these details right can cost you down the line, so it’s best to seek advice from experienced advisors and have an attorney who specializes in SBA-funded SMB acquisitions review your LOI before moving forward.

DSCR (Debt Service Coverage Ratio):
This is a critical metric for any business acquisition, especially when financing is involved. DSCR measures how easily the business can cover its debt payments with its income. When considering a business, you want to make sure there’s enough income from the business to pay yourself, cover all operating expenses, and handle any potential variability in the business—so that if revenue dips, you’re still in a safe position to meet your obligations. In our opinion, this is the most important number when evaluating whether the business is financially sound.

J-Curve:
The J-Curve represents the common financial trajectory many businesses experience right after acquisition. Initially, performance or profitability may dip as the new owner implements changes, integrates the business, and absorbs the transition costs. This dip is followed by an upward trend, where the business stabilizes and grows. As a first-time buyer, it’s important to recognize that you might face this temporary downturn, and you'll need to plan your cash flow carefully to ride through it. The length and depth of the J-Curve can vary, but with the right strategy and support, the business should return to or exceed previous profitability levels over time.
Asset Sale vs. Stock Sale:
Asset Sale: In an asset sale, the buyer purchases individual assets of the business (like equipment, inventory, and intellectual property) rather than acquiring the company itself. This option is often preferred by buyers because it allows them to avoid taking on the company's liabilities.
Stock Sale: In a stock sale, the buyer purchases shares of the business, effectively taking over the entire company, including its liabilities. This structure is often simpler for the seller but may carry more risk for the buyer.

Due Diligence:
Due diligence is the investigative process a buyer conducts to verify the financial, legal, and operational status of the business they are purchasing. It typically includes reviewing financial statements, contracts, intellectual property, customer lists, and any legal issues. The goal is to uncover any risks or liabilities that could affect the deal and ensure there are no surprises. Comprehensive due diligence is critical for first-time buyers to avoid future problems.

Earn-Out (and Performance-Based Forgivable Note for SBA):
An earn-out is a structure where a portion of the sale price is contingent on the business's future performance after the sale. It can bridge gaps when the buyer and seller have different valuations of the business. However, SBA loans do not allow earn-outs, so instead, buyers may use a performance-based forgivable note. In this structure, a portion of the sale price is tied to specific performance metrics. If those metrics aren’t met, the buyer can forgive part of the note, offering a similar outcome to an earn-out while staying compliant with SBA rules. This structure can only be offered under certain circumstances, but it allows buyers to make a more competitive offer without putting their DSCR (Debt Service Coverage Ratio) at risk, ensuring the business can still comfortably cover its loan payments.

Working Capital:
Working capital is the cash and short-term assets needed to keep the business running day-to-day. It includes cash on hand, accounts receivable, and inventory minus liabilities like accounts payable. Many first-time buyers don’t realize the importance of including working capital in the purchase price, and as a result, they may overpay for the business. Banks will require that a certain amount of working capital remains in the business to ensure it can continue operating smoothly after the sale. If it’s not included in the purchase agreement, buyers might need to bring in extra cash post-closing. Therefore, negotiating working capital adjustments is critical to ensure the business has enough liquidity from day one without putting additional financial strain on the buyer.

Goodwill:
Goodwill represents the intangible assets of a business that add value beyond its physical assets, such as brand reputation, customer loyalty, or intellectual property. When you buy a business, a portion of the purchase price may go toward goodwill, reflecting the value of these non-tangible assets. Goodwill can be critical in determining the overall value of the business and its future growth potential.

Multiple (Valuation Multiple):
A multiple is used to determine the value of a business by applying a multiplier to a company's earnings, such as EBITDA or SDE. For example, a business with an EBITDA of $500,000 and a multiple of 3x would be valued at $1.5 million. The multiple reflects various factors, including the industry, growth prospects, and risk level. Understanding the right multiple for the business you’re looking to buy is key to ensuring you don’t overpay.

Purchase Agreement (APA or PA):
The Purchase Agreement (PA) or Asset Purchase Agreement (APA) is the final, legally binding document that outlines the terms and conditions of the sale. It includes the purchase price, payment terms, details of the assets or stock being transferred, and any contingencies. It’s essential to have legal and financial advisors review this document, as it sets the framework for the transition of ownership and the buyer’s future obligations.

Seller Financing:
Seller financing occurs when the seller of the business acts as a lender, allowing the buyer to pay a portion of the purchase price over time, often at an agreed interest rate. This arrangement can help bridge financing gaps for buyers and make the deal more attractive for both parties. Seller financing is particularly useful for first-time buyers, as it reduces the upfront cash needed and keeps the seller invested in the future success of the business.

Personal Guarantee:
A personal guarantee is a commitment from the buyer to personally repay any loan or financial obligation related to the acquisition if the business is unable to do so. Many lenders, including those providing SBA loans, require a personal guarantee from buyers, particularly first-time buyers, as a way to mitigate risk. This means that if the business fails, the buyer’s personal assets may be on the line to cover the debt.

CapEx (Capital Expenditures):
CapEx doesn’t appear on the Profit & Loss (P&L) statement because it’s not considered an operational expense—it’s a long-term investment. This can make CapEx a hidden cost that surprises many buyers, as ongoing CapEx (especially Maintenance CapEx) is essential to keep the business running. Buyers need to dig deeper into financial statements, particularly the cash flow statement, to get a clearer view of how much a business is spending on CapEx annually. A business may look profitable based on the P&L, but high CapEx needs can significantly reduce available cash flow.
If a cash flow statement isn’t available, a good indication of significant CapEx spending can be found in the depreciation number. If depreciation is high, it’s important to dig deeper to understand how much the business is spending on maintaining or replacing its assets, as this could signal a higher ongoing cost for the buyer.

Using Financial Statements to Evaluate a Business:
Income Statement (P&L):
Use the P&L to assess the profitability of the business by looking at how much revenue it generates relative to its expenses. However, be aware that it doesn’t include CapEx or other long-term investments, which means high earnings might not translate to strong cash flow. To evaluate earnings accurately, check for trends in revenue and whether expenses are consistent or fluctuating.
Balance Sheet:
The balance sheet shows the company’s assets, liabilities, and equity, giving you an overview of its financial health. It helps you see whether the company has too much debt or is under-leveraged. Look for red flags like high debt or a shrinking asset base, and review how well the business manages working capital—particularly its receivables and payables.
Cash Flow Statement:
This is critical because it shows how cash moves through the business, revealing actual liquidity. Focus on operating cash flow to see if the business generates enough to cover debt and reinvest. The CapEx section of the cash flow statement gives insight into the hidden costs of maintaining or growing the business—costs that don’t appear on the P&L but can significantly affect cash available to pay debts or yourself.

Accrual vs. Cash Accounting:
Accrual Accounting:
In accrual accounting, revenues and expenses are recorded when they are earned or incurred, not when cash changes hands. This method gives a more accurate picture of the company’s financial performance, as it accounts for all obligations. However, it can also hide cash flow issues if you’re not careful, since revenue might be recognized before it’s actually collected.
Cash Accounting:
Cash accounting records revenue and expenses only when cash is received or paid. It’s simpler but may not reflect the true financial health of a business with large receivables or payables, especially if the business extends credit to customers. Many small businesses use this method, but it may underestimate future liabilities or overestimate current financial strength.
Understanding which method is used is essential for evaluating a business. If a business is on an accrual basis, you’ll want to look at the cash flow statement to ensure the business has the cash needed to pay bills and debts.
