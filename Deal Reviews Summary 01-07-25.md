  Hello.

0:19 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  How you doing?

0:21 - AcquiMatch Team
  Good.

0:23 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Good little discussion. Good questions.

0:27 - AcquiMatch Team
  Yeah, that was good. was glad you were able to. Cover the Joe party, seem cheerful or glad that you.

0:33 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  I figured like if I just brought up the spreadsheet and showed it rather than his, then hopefully the concept would come through, but.

0:42 - AcquiMatch Team
  Yeah.

0:43 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  that'll plant some seeds for your conversation later.

0:46 - AcquiMatch Team
  Perfect.

0:49 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Nice. And when are you speaking to Jason or remind me what you've already talked through the L.Y.

0:54 - AcquiMatch Team
  So. So I just, I just scheduled a call with them. you know, two hours. go for after this. at the top of this hour, I got a call with him.  And again, we did a call for probably 30 minutes last night where we talked through everything. And he was like, I'm ready to submit.  And I was just, he's like, what do you think? And I was like, I think you should call one more time and ask about that margin.  I was like, that's what I that's what I do. And I like, I don't want to step on your toes here or anything.  But like, if this were me, I would do that. And he was like, okay. So he called the owner and asked about it and confirmed that the average margin is around 42% and, you know, we had a calculator, 58% based on his numbers.  So I said, okay. And then what I want to talk to you about like, it's just these two, this one and the Joe one today.  That's all I have for you today. You want me to kind of go right into that?

1:56 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah. So what I'd like to get from today is just like an overall view of what's happening with all the clients.  So, um, just so I can get an idea. Like everybody, is everybody in a good place? Have we touched in with everybody?  Do we have any packages? So, um, if we can end the call with a good overview of what's happened, or maybe we start there and then spend what time we have left with these specific ones, whatever you guys want to do.  But that's kind of what I need from today is like, how are we, how are we doing at the beginning of the year?

2:32 - AcquiMatch Team
  Where are we looking or how are we looking? Okay, cool. Um, yeah, so I guess let's start with the half a spot.  Start there. Um, you want to open that up?

2:43 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Show your screen and we'll start there and you can ask any questions at the end up.

2:46 - Luke Gillespie
  Cool, thank you. Yeah, did you want us to talk about deals or more go on the clients, Athena?

2:52 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  I'm sorry. Um, I mean, you can bring the half a spot, um, I think Anka might have another meeting.  thought she was going to join us so she could see we're using the HubSpot, but we'll record it and have her look at it because it might make sense to have a client specific report too so we can just see all the clients in one place.  Also before we dive into that fantastic job update today.

3:17 - Luke Gillespie
  Thank you. Thanks for trusting me with the responsibility to present in front of the clients is great experience.
  SCREEN SHARING: Luke started screen sharing - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/207117637?timestamp=206.711774

3:23 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  I had no doubt it was really good, really good explanation. You took a lot of the feedback from our last conversation clearly and it felt like you were well prepared and did a great overview.

3:33 - Luke Gillespie
  So nice job on that. Thank you. Looking forward to hopefully doing more of that.

3:38 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Absolutely. Hey, I would love for you to keep a pulse on things. if you catch stuff like that, I you think it's a good thing for us to be updating like that, that puts that is even better service to our clients.  So by all means, bring that stuff for, you know, we might assign you a little task to look into that and do more investment or industry updates.

3:58 - Luke Gillespie
  I think that was great. I love that. you could send some sources my way, some more sources than just listening to acquiring mine's episodes, because we'll probably doesn't really talk about that much.  But all right, well, good.

4:09 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Actually, I'll get Anka to forward you. I'm on all the email lists for like people doing industry update, like that do really good emails on just like industry updates.  And maybe we can forward those to you. So you can get subscribed to them, keep an eye on those things too.  But the SMB Law Group, particularly on LinkedIn, they do a lot of industry updates, which are really good.

4:35 - Luke Gillespie
  Okay. All right, cool. Well, first, I'll tell you about two off-market leads that are in the works right now.  This one happened that I forgot to mention to you. Well, actually, it happened like at the end of Friday, right before we all went on break before the holidays.  But it's this lady. It's like an enterprise content marketing business, something like that. And she's saying she's netting about a hundred K income.  at the end of the day and she's completely absentee working like no hours on it. So that could be maybe something for VH and maybe we could make it work for SP if they're interested in a little absentee opportunity.  She didn't even know if she could sell her business. kind of explained to her about everything. she's traveling back from the UK to the US today as we're speaking.  I haven't been able to schedule a call with Ryan, but we're open to get down Ryan's calendar as soon as possible.  Another off market for AH at HVAC company in Oklahoma. I have a call, Ryan has a schedule to call with Ryan for next Wednesday.  Ryan's going to be meeting the owner and seeing if that could be a fit. Hopefully that works out. So that's kind of two off market up to right now.  And then as far as on market, so this is the list. It's all updated, but down here I found this cool little tool where you can I can have it line by line.

5:53 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So it's kind of easier for me to go through.

5:56 - Luke Gillespie
  Great. So in high priority, we have this CM installation and drywall services. The broker went on vacation or something.  He emailed us back saying, talk to this broker. And so I messaged them again today and just try to get into contact to hop on a call.  This HVAC, again, I just waited for the broker to get back to me. I messaged them again today to get a call scheduled.  And then this is the roofing company we were talking about before the break. We were gonna present it to Chris but we wanted to get some clarification on price because the broker had changed the business by selling from $6 million to $10 million.  I have been on the phone with the guy today.

6:29 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  He's really cool. He likes me in the way we work. And he just put out the $10 million to get tire kickers away from the deal.  It's open to offers. he's That's a great way to do it. increase the purchase rate by $4 million.

6:42 - Luke Gillespie
  You're gonna like get rid of all your buyers then. Yeah, yeah. He's really not playing a run.

6:49 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Oh, these brokers, they just make me laugh, man.

6:53 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah.

6:54 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah. Yeah.

6:56 - Luke Gillespie
  So anyways, I talked to that broker and He explained me how, yeah, and he had said this in the previous call, this owner, he's not really in a rush to sell, and he's really focused on the right buyer and the right deal.  so Chris could use that to his leverage. I started on the right of today.

7:11 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  may be like halfway done. I'll finish it tomorrow, but yeah, so that's in the do right up stage, up completed.  Remember that flooring business that we talked about for AA previously. Just real quick on since that was all CM.  Have we made contact with him this year?

7:29 - Luke Gillespie
  Is he still offline for the holidays? Yeah, he's still ghosting us on because reached out with multiple messages, still waiting for response.  We talked about it this morning, Ryan. We said it's just a second week after New Year's, maybe he's just taking extra vacation.

7:44 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay, so he hasn't been put on slack yet, so I think it's signal is. Yep. Are we contacting him on signal?

7:52 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah, all good. Ryan have been messaging to him.

7:56 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah. Okay. Cool. Let's keep an eye on that then, because we don't want to piss off Mr. Brokers also by like sending over businesses if the clients aren't responsive.  But I guess you'll have to get them to sign the ND in everything before we get there. So cool.

8:15 - Luke Gillespie
  Okay. Next, there was remember this foreign business for AA. And it looks like a good business, but there were concerns about the owner like relationship dependency.  So you wanted me, I reached back out to the broker. The broker talked to the talk to the owner and he just copy and pasted the response from the owner to me.  so I didn't copy and paste owners words, but I basically broke it down in a short little paragraph on the right up right here.  So that right up is done and completed. are just waiting.

8:57 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay. Great. Good. Good. or that off. at least we know it's a concern and we can flag it and we've we've asked the question and then and then the client can decide like knowingly walk in knowing that that's something that they need to dig into.

9:11 - Luke Gillespie
  So I'm happy with that. Anything to add on that right. I'm assuming Ryan and you have talked through all these though.  Yeah.

9:18 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, cool.

9:19 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah. Okay. So that that right was completed. Alex messaged us that he's really sick today and she's not really responding very well.  So we just haven't sent that over because she hasn't signed. The India yet.

9:33 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Ryan, when's the last time you've had a like chat chat with her on the phone or zoom.

9:47 - AcquiMatch Team
  I guess it was right before break right that last week or Christmas. Yeah, because she hasn't she showed up to like one virus.

10:00 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  And she hasn't shown up to any sense and like feels like she's not moving forward on any of the deals and she's kind of poking her head in the sand.

10:08 - Luke Gillespie
  So I'm curious.

10:11 - AcquiMatch Team
  Yeah, so.

10:16 - Luke Gillespie
  She texted us today, unknown period, very sick period.

10:22 - AcquiMatch Team
  Yeah. Yeah, like that last day that I talked to her, she did seem like really off and some day she'll seem on.  So yeah, she did seem off and she I think she even did say I'm having I go tough time right now or something like that.  So. Yeah, she's been kind of like low energy as recently. What was the last one I got? Is it.  The last one I trying to get her to do, I think I left with her trying to, I had made the introduction between her and the bicycle business.  And I was trying to say, hey, just do the, do the, do the site visit. And they were, they were talking about that.

11:19 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah, you were trying to convince me to visit.

11:22 - AcquiMatch Team
  Can you remember if she actually pushed on that? See if she did, I just want to check my email and see if I make sure I didn't miss that somehow.  Okay. Okay, actually, so she messaged her that last Friday and either I would just no longer on that chain or she didn't respond.  So Friday before Christmas, she messaged that broker, he messaged back and then they went silent. So I can, I did follow up and ask her where she is.  I'm not sure she hasn't responded yet. I'm sick.

12:04 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  I can see if I can get off the Given the small market she's operating in, I think we need to do some damage control with the brokers.  So if she's ghosting the brokers, like on the moving company and that the bike shop, then those are going to be the same brokers that are going to find the next deal form.  Exactly. So we don't want them to be like, oh, this is somebody that we Sartime, if she is genuinely sick and not able to work on stuff right now, then I think we should express empathy and be like really sorry to hear that.  Is this a, you know, not able to work on deals situation right now? Would you like me to send a holding message to the brokers and just update them that you're having a personal situation and not able to respond at this time or something like that?  Like I would maybe ask her if she would like us to do that, right? is it like, you know, not feeling well?  you think this is something that will be, you know, for the foreseeable in which case, like, would you like us to to notify the brokers that you're going to be offline for a little bit?  And if she's like, yes, please, then we can do that, at least try to save face and then try to figure out what's going on.  With her if we need to just like give her some space While she deals with this and is able to find back to herself because it's it's the thing with her that I haven't been able to figure out The difference between her shutting down because she's scared and not able to move forward versus what is a genuine health thing But in any case what we don't want to do is burn those relationships of the brokers because she's in such a small market They're gonna have her stuff if we keep working with her.  So That's the way I would play it At this point unless you guys have other ideas, but I don't think we should leave the brokers ghosted Okay, I want to message her today.

14:40 - Luke Gillespie
  She said thanks for the text We're sorry to hear that you're sick.

14:43 - AcquiMatch Team
  Please. Let me know when you're feeling better and we can schedule a quick meeting then Yeah, so I can do what you said at the end is on top of that all send a message like hey check it in with you You know last time we spoke You know, there was a few businesses that we're interested in that we manage  Brokers from those brokers that follow it up with me. You know, I understand you're not feeling well right now If you'd like I could just send a whole thing message to those brokers and You know Isn't that what you're feeling better or something?

15:16 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, I'd use chat GBT tell it what's going on and like have it write a response to her like be empathetic, but also It's not you know We don't want to leave these brokers like ghosted because it could affect future bills Would you like me to send you know, would you like me to send a message on your behalf to tell them that you're Feeling on what you've been feeling unwell or you know, whatever you're comfortable with I can say you're unwell I can say you've had a personal situation come up um, and you'll be back in touch as soon as you know more but you know Either you or I should probably get in touch with them and let them know that So it doesn't affect our future opportunities in your market something like that.  This is where I used to GPT though because I'm not great with writing out the empathy language or I over explain it or whatever and it's just like short and sweet like basically what needs to happen is we need to protect those relationships with the brokers and if we're moving along on deals and then the client like ghosting them that they're not going to open the door the next time you get in touch and if she is genuinely sick and unwell then I think she'd appreciate us doing a whole while she gets herself better and then before we and in that same breath maybe like is this something that will be for the foreseeable like should we should be the altering how we're sending deals to at this point or do you think this is a short lived thing like but again chat GPT will write something better because it's like what we need is information on like is this a  serious thing that we need to consider when we're looking at deals for you or is it a couple days and you'll feel better kind of thing?

17:09 - AcquiMatch Team
  Okay, I'll do that.

17:12 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah, but have chat, GBT just make it short to Saint. It's like I need to find out from her how long this will be and if she wants me to contact the brokers because it could risk the relationships, but I want to be empathetic at the same time.

17:25 - AcquiMatch Team
  What's the best way to say that? Got it.

17:29 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Sweet. Okay, cool. Thanks. On to the next.

17:33 - Luke Gillespie
  Thank you, Luke. All right. yeah, that right. It's done. We're just waiting to get a response from Alex to send it to her.  This was the gas station that we sent to BH before the break. His response was, so there was a contamination issue with the oil spilling into the ground, but the broker says insurance was covering it.  So BH's only feedback to Ryan was the spill is concerning, I think. then Ryan said, okay, can you hop on a quick 30-minute call to talk about that?

17:59 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  And he just has a response. Okay, are you familiar with environmentals, Ryan? Look into level one and level two environmentals.  So basically when you buy a business or when you buy property, if there's like environmental issues and that can like preclude you from being enough about it to be able to give you specifics, but I just know with like dry cleaning businesses, for example, you can inherit the liability when you buy the land and then in order to sell the land, oftentimes there's like something called the level one and the level two environmental level one is somebody just coming out and checking things, the level two is where they have to start like digging up the land and like doing all sorts of  to like find out what what they actually did.  into it. So if there was a spill, then there might be a lot of complications with the sale. So for both of you actually, I would like look into level one, level two, environmentals and like what does it mean for buying a business that has land attached to it?  So you can just get a basic overview of what all that means and then be able to go back to the broker and have those conversations and or explain to the client like, yes, you might be looking at it, et cetera, et cetera.  I just know there are big pain in the  and I wish I knew more, but that's a knowledge gap for me.  I've kind of avoided the real estate stuff throughout this process. just know it's a thing.

19:41 - Luke Gillespie
  Okay. Yeah. See, is what I wrote on my notes about it. They have this contamination, but it's covered under insurance and the broker said, squirrel samples have been improving and it should be cleared up in an 18 month time period.  And I believe they're already five months into that 18 month time period, something like that.

19:56 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Or maybe a little longer. But it might, it might affect the Yeah, like I don't think insurance will cover the new buyer's liability and that sort of thing.  So that's why but it's good for you both anyway to learn about those sorts of things. So anything like where there's chemicals used on the dry cleaners car washes etc etc and there's land attached to the sale then there's likely going to be these environmental studies needed.  So then at least if we know what they are that we can ask the broker like you know what do you think here what you know like have you guys looked into this at all have any idea like what kind of liability that they're looking at or if this is going to like have an issue with the sale.  Hopefully the broker has experience with these types of things if they're selling them.

20:44 - Luke Gillespie
  So yeah, exactly. Okay and next there's that the music business that JB rejected SP likes it. We introduced them to the broker today and immediately Paul will you send an email to schedule a call so they're they're picking up their pace so that's promising good to see.

21:00 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Hey, maybe I was wrong. That was them after all and you guys were right on that one Okay, I could see Steve like he'd love that the we would deal in with like, you know music people and stuff like that.

21:15 - Luke Gillespie
  So Nice work. Yep. right, Yeah, there's a few deals that I'm trying to get co-scheduled for and then I have two calls tomorrow But that's that's all I have to talk about right now.

21:26 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  I'll have more updates on Thursday Okay, how are we looking on Gil?

21:32 - Luke Gillespie
  Oh Good, New York has so many deals. He has such a deal flow like I've been pushing so many RFI's Okay, so he's he's bringing you to a search.

21:42 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So when are we anticipating getting him his first write up?

21:46 - AcquiMatch Team
  I Actually, I have a is off market ready this week.

21:50 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay.

21:51 - AcquiMatch Team
  I'm putting on one more thing just the 2024 financials Which he said he would get to me very easily  He said he'd do it today. hasn't got it to me today, but literally, I'm pretty much done. I just need those 20 people of financials.  And once that's done, we'll play and do that right up and do that one to him. And I feel really good about it.  think, like, it would be, like, you know, all markets, I pledge them to, like, we should highly consider this.  So, so we're at a good start with him as long as I can get that done.

22:24 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Great. And then, so I didn't see any other deals for him. And then schedule a broker call or anything like that.  So, what's the, what's blocking the guild deals from flowing through that one market?

22:38 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah, not right now. We're just waiting to get RFIs and just get some more Sims. But his, his deal flow is really good.

22:45 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  I mean, it's, it's New York area. So there's so many deals coming in and I've seen a lot of quality deals.  Okay. Have we been with them since the New Year started at all as, apart from, like, the buyer's club messages that we sent.  anything.
  ACTION ITEM: Msg Gil re ongoing deal work; update on off-market deal, broker call scheduling - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/207117637?timestamp=1388.9999

23:02 - Luke Gillespie
  I'm looking at the channel right now. Excuse me. No, kind of just a happy new message. And yeah, I think I'm sure Ryan's just waiting until he finalizes up this off market deal and then he's gonna hop on a call with him.

23:19 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay, Ryan, can you send a message in the meantime? Because when they're brand new to the search, they get anxious when they don't hear from us.  like, we want to make sure that we're just like managing their expectations. hey, team's working on some cool deals.  I actually have one that I think is going to be screaming that I just want to validate the financials before I get it over to you, just over communicating while they're sitting there waiting.  Otherwise, that can ramp up the anxiety on their side. So let's get a message over to him on that amazing if we can get him nice like wondering what's going on.  How about Hey Jay, what's the status with them?

24:03 - Luke Gillespie
  We got a lot of deals that had came in earlier this week, on Monday, I pushed like 15 RFI's, Eda told me that all of them were already sold.  taking off the market. So what Anka theorizing sounds about rise that a lot of these brokers, they still had the listings up, but then now coming back the first work week of the new year, they were taking all of them down because they've already been sold or off the market.

24:30 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Gotcha. Okay, so what's the latest on that client, where are we at with them?

24:39 - AcquiMatch Team
  So yeah, they have the lowest deal flow. That's something that we need to improve. If there's one of that, if there's a client that we have or we need to actually put more attention on focus and figure out a career, more deal flow, that's the one.

24:54 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay, do they have any, like what happened with the roofing business that she was looking at? Like where are they at?  overall in their journey with us.

25:03 - AcquiMatch Team
  We did not. Oh, she just actually messaged me. Do you have time tomorrow to talk? Okay. He actually dismissed me a few hours ago and she said, do you have time to talk tomorrow?  I'm having trouble wreaking, reconciling the timing of this one. appreciate that with you. So like a schedule called her mom.

25:37 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Just remind me of what what active deals they have.

25:40 - AcquiMatch Team
  It's just the it's just the roofing business.

25:45 - Luke Gillespie
  Oh, yeah, she rejected the car the car wash.

25:50 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  I'm not surprised.

25:52 - Luke Gillespie
  What did she say? Let me pull it up right now. Ryan, she did the thing again, like the other clients.  She sent me a private message. I think I sent you a screenshot, but yeah, or oh, no, she just she mentioned this in the red.  Sorry. Yeah, she replied in thread. Hi, Luke. Thank you again for saying this over. We have a chance to review and are going to pass on the car wash to a little cash flow in a town that is two hours away with a declining population, even with room for some growth.  It doesn't have the visible upside in cash flow that we want.

26:26 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay, it doesn't sound like she really captured that that's what car washes are like though. So I think we need to like hammer that point home, right, and draft something back to her and be like, we thought that would be the case.  We just wanted you to see a car wash. Is it okay to eliminate car washes from the future? Like, so I think you need to be like, now that you've seen a car wash, are we okay to eliminate that?  Because this is what car washes look like. Ryan, maybe that comes from you?

26:57 - AcquiMatch Team
  Yeah, I'll do that.

26:58 - Luke Gillespie
  My caller.

26:59 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  All right. Yeah, so just just make sure she knows we're not sending her deals that only have 20k and profit.

27:07 - Luke Gillespie
  Like she was asking for it.

27:09 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  We told her they're not good. We sent her one anyway, just a shake and look at one. So just reiterate that Ryan, because we don't want clients being like, you're sending me  deals.  So he wanted garwashes, so we sent you one. What is their off-market situation looking like any bites or anything there?

27:28 - Luke Gillespie
  I don't have any leads right now.

27:30 - AcquiMatch Team
  Yeah. Yeah. haven't had any leads and we have told Hawkeye, anything that whatever it costs or whatever we have to do to do the off-market for JJ, that is the priority.  So I've relayed that to her, but I did not follow up with her today about exactly what's been done on that front.  So I can get back with Hawkeye and say where we are with like really specifying. about off-market deal flow for JJ.

28:12 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  And then also with the deal team doing the research, she just apparently just had a call with Massan, so maybe prioritizing JJ if we haven't already?

28:24 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah, they have them. And the way that's kind of turning out Athena is the deal team is they're basically just scraping like all the deals, even the ones that are just way too low of profits.  And we're seeing higher deal flow for like all of our clients pretty much, which the deal team is doing their job, I'm not necessarily blaming them in India.  don't think it's their fault, but they're getting us more deals. But let's say instead of getting two deals a day for Jenny, we got 20 deals a day, but 18 of those 20 deals have 100k profit, 60k SD.  So are we giving that feedback to Anka? So we said that in the meeting today, August said, yeah, mean, August said that's what the deal team is doing, that's what we talked about.  There's just, it seems like there's no other deals in Ohio on the market.

29:12 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay, but did we instruct them to put deals that don't fit the parameters on there?

29:20 - Luke Gillespie
  Yes, we did, yes.

29:21 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay.

29:22 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah, we did that on purpose.

29:24 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay. What are your guys's thoughts or plans? Because it sounds like that. are there any other clients that are in that kind of situation where it's like, this one feels like a little bit dire?

29:54 - Luke Gillespie
  No, I don't feel that way about anyone else. We always make things work for the others, but Jenny is.  Worry some about you Ryan.

30:02 - AcquiMatch Team
  My my plan was I wrote that down after our discussion today and I just Gonna block out, you know an hour in my calendar tomorrow to just only focus on JJ So just everything's dropped and I'm just gonna go online from and just search brokers names even last week actually did email.  I just linked in a broker who was in that area I was like, hey, I'm looking for deals. Can you help me?  What do you have? I'm an active fire 18 wasn't very helpful, but I was just thinking I should just do more of that just Find brokers and oh, I would cleave and just go right out to what I have money food.  do you have? Go direct that way if I can't find Sites or anything like that.

30:48 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So just gonna do a manual search for an hour and see what I could come up with Yeah, I'm gonna use to do that on Like when we went into a new market we'd go on LinkedIn and like hit them all up that  way. um, M&A advisors broker, you know, like anything that has like a title in it that might be an advisor.  And then what about Axial?

31:16 - AcquiMatch Team
  Did you have a look at that one? Yeah, so I looked at both of those. looked at PE and Axial.  So, I was like, PE says they're like $250 a year or something like that.

31:30 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  and so I told Anka, like, let's do that. Let's just- Yeah, already imprisoned that one.

31:34 - AcquiMatch Team
  Yeah. And then with Axial, they didn't have any prices. said Phil has formed and some of them will get back to you.  And so I fill out the form and then they send me an email actually just a few, five hours ago and said, it doesn't look like you're gonna be a fit.  And I'm like, I hardly put anything in that form. How do know? So, either they're BS or they have a phone number list on their site.  I'm just gonna call them and just be like, This is what I am. This is what we do. Like, what do you have?

32:04 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  how do you think we could work together? So, yeah, good.

32:07 - AcquiMatch Team
  Again, because I don't have prices and they email me that generic email with a very little form, that does make me feel like they're not legit.

32:15 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  But I know, I know, I know, I know they are, like, that's, that's what maybe talked to Brad, the broker in Minnesota, because he said that's where they list all their deals.  They only listed on Axial.

32:29 - AcquiMatch Team
  Okay, so I don't know, maybe they looked at our website and they think we're like a service provider or something, you know?  Yeah, okay, okay. I'll, I'll call them.

32:44 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  But like, worst case scenario, if it's because we're not a buyer, then there's other ways for us to figure that out, know?  one of the deal team, like, set up a profile or something. then are they open to online business also?
  ACTION ITEM: Schedule call w/ Jenny; discuss expanding deal criteria (geography, online biz, etc.) - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/207117637?timestamp=1991.9999

33:13 - AcquiMatch Team
  JJ is not. She didn't. She didn't say she wasn't open but I kind of talked about it. She's like yeah I don't think so.

33:22 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  I think have a conversation with her tomorrow also like remember when we have problems with deal flow we don't hide it.  We need to tell them like your geographic restrictions are significantly reducing deal flow. Now we typically see you know people pick up in January but I'd like to revisit that you know are you open to other geographies under certain circumstances like you know I use the example today on a sales call which I close another client today by the way so wow good start to the year.  Yeah, um, he's gonna be  great. And he's in, um, Leander, he actually met Kevin on an event.

34:10 - AcquiMatch Team
  Oh, okay.

34:11 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Cool. Nice. yeah. Leander is like just north of Austin, but, um, so, you know, with Kevin and Lindsey, they considered San Antonio because they're like, there's a, we can turn it into a hybrid situation or maybe a fully remote situation.  So, but like, if the geography is so limited that we can't look at other areas and we won't ever see those kinds of opportunities.  So there might, I, but I guess the whole point of this is, you need to have a conversation with her tomorrow and be like, we have tried our artist not looking at online businesses, only looking in your geography deals with them.  It's going to be slow. you want to look at more deals, more volume of deals that we need to talk about your deal box.

35:00 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah if you remember Ryan in like her onboarding calls she had originally said she was open to there's some locations where they have family and they visit sometimes it's like every is in Utah and then Arizona that she said she could do it if it was like she could go there once a month maybe twice a month there was more of an absentee opportunity so at this point we're desperate we you should maybe bring that up in the call be like should can we start looking at those deals you know an absentee opportunity something you could operate from Ohio but it's located over there and yeah maybe ask her if she's open-minded to kind of opening her filters in different types of businesses that she may have that she blocked off before on her industry she that we just we we got to do anything I mean you've seen the deal flow Ryan she gets nothing or are there certain variables or certain situations where you would be open to it you know like if we made this hybrid if it wasn't if it was the potential to become a hybrid or to become a

36:00 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  You know, or like you said, the perfect if she, I don't even remember saying that in her onboard calls, so good memory that they mentioned that they were open to other areas under certain circumstances.  I think you need to say like now is the time for us to expand, you know, when we can always turn down a deal.  if we're working on such a limited deal, we're just not going to be able to send you as many deals as we would like you to be working on at this stage.

36:30 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah, and I'm looking at her industry sheet right now. She's actually already very open-minded. Really the only things she said no to was basically education and children, pet services and restaurants.  she's, her industry sheet is wide open for everything else. And even with that, her deal flow is still horribly low.  Like, yeah, maybe you could ask her to just keep an open mind for these, maybe other cities that are kind of further away.  if it was Indianapolis or Cincinnati and she only had to go in once a week, once every two weeks.

37:00 - AcquiMatch Team
  Just just we got to put our put our thinking caps on and see what we can do any try to keep an open mind Yeah, I think what I want to do is Because that just doesn't make sense to me I google the population that area and it's not it's it's normal So it should be more deals.  So yeah, that's why I kind of came to things I think I just need to get a broker on the phone and be like where do I like do you have anything if not?  Where how do I find deals in Cleveland? Like where are deals? Yeah, so I think just speaking to someone directly on the phone It's not multiple people and just getting a better idea.  I did I idea. Well help What was the guy that we talked to Brad was that his name? Yeah, he's a mini-apples Yeah, he was good like he just talked to him when we talked about a little bit he kind of gave us feedback Oh, you could do this you could do that So just like if I could do a call similar to what we do with Brad with One or two Cleveland brokers maybe we'll get some some more leads

38:00 - Luke Gillespie
  Okay, yeah, I remember I told you, I mean, it's just one anecdotal evidence, but even a broker I was on the phone with was telling me about Ohio.  And he was like, yeah, Ohio is just so dry. We see so few deals there. So, so I guess the Ryan, what you're saying is you want to, you want to really try one last effort to try to find something yourself and talk to some brokers before we have that combo with with Jenny.

38:22 - AcquiMatch Team
  Well, I'll do it. I mean, I'll have all the conversations, right? you know, I just know from a client's perspective, I put myself in their shoes, like, if you start telling me, Hey, can we should we look at California when they're in Cleveland?  It's like, I'm going to be the best thing. So, I'd rather just like make her understand. I've literally done all like, I've called brokers.  I've done this. I've done that. This is where you're at. Do you want to look at these other things?  Yeah, actually, now that we were just talking, I actually thought of something I actually might have in mind, actually.  I didn't off market in Texas. that was like okay and then he kind of ghosted me and he just reached out to me actually in the New Year's okay actually Ryan I think I'm about sighing and actually her I think it's her sister something was there in Texas in North North North Dallas so that actually might work so maybe I'll pick up that conversation if I could be a Jenny please that's just a lead I might have now that we're talking about it but I think the best route is I was gonna go see if I can get some brokers on the on the call and maybe inside out some messages like some transfer of brokers that I know okay it was the person to speak to in Cleveland and then just go right through right there yeah and then like with Jenny it's like hey we cast a wide net we can always throw some of them back right but if we're fishing with a tiny little net then it's it's just it's gonna take longer so just

40:00 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  reiterate that point, like we will keep it restricted if that's what you want to do and we're doing absolutely everything and more than we do for all the other clients to find new opportunities, but just make sure she understands like deal flow is going to be slow.  It's going to be a trickle, unless she gives us an opportunity to open up in other areas. Online might be an easy way to start doing that too.

40:24 - Luke Gillespie
  Yeah. Yeah.

40:27 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Like to just be able to look at some online businesses for also so. But yeah, I trust you guys, I just want to make sure we're having these client these client conversations early so it's not a perception that we're not doing our job, and that it's, it's on to their restrictions right so if here's here's your options to open up.  Your deal box. Yeah, you start looking at more opportunities and also. Are you cool with us taking car washes off the menu now?  Now that you've seen one.

41:00 - Luke Gillespie
  We were showing you they're not, they're not good or do want to keep looking at car washes that might only cash flow a little bit.  Yeah. And I mean, like I mentioned the team meeting last week, Ryan, like you worked so hard and always go above and beyond to help this business succeed, but it's like just from a business operations perspective, it's so inefficient for you to be using your valuable time to manually search for James deals and not being able to use the team that we already have, you know, like the the deal team in India, but we so we're working on a solution there.

41:34 - AcquiMatch Team
  Yeah, I mean, I knew this was going to be like still an issue that we haven't, we haven't figured this out completely, you know, like I was still doing this before we even came on.

41:42 - Luke Gillespie
  Like I would still be doing your thing and then I would also be like, all right, I can't find anything.  I got to go find something else.

41:48 - AcquiMatch Team
  So that's not, that's not new. And that's good. Like I said, like today, I was like, we brought that up and I said, just tell me when it's happening so I can lock out an hour to make that happen, I can do I can.
  ACTION ITEM: Record "smash session" for Jenny's deal search; create training resource - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/207117637?timestamp=2518.9999  do that, you know? So that's fine. That's cool. have a lot of them and I think for this call, I'm going to schedule a call there and I'll figure it out.

42:09 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay, great. Ryan, when you're doing those little like smash sessions, it might be worth recording them. So whoever we bring in like has some some training of like how you approach it and what you do, if you just like read it as you're doing it, then you just kind of have a bank of like, here's when I, when we have a fireside need to find a client, here's how I do it.  So I like recording those things up front because we know we're going to be getting some resources and to help with that anyway.

42:39 - AcquiMatch Team
  Yeah, yeah. Okay, we'll do.

42:42 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Cool. Okay, so that's all the clients except for Jason, how's he looking? mean, I know he's obviously submitting an LOI here.  Other deal flow because we know he keeps track, not accurately. Right. He was one of the

43:00 - Luke Gillespie
  deals was on the the hub spot list I wasn't going to bring up but it's been headed over is he meeting with the office rental crown office suites Eric Tom nary is he did he schedule a meeting with them right.  He told me he reached out to him I haven't I haven't asked him out that's going because I've been so focused on this one because I really just want him to buy this business and then I'll be it but but but now I have a call with him actually right now so I'll ask him about ask him where he's at on that one cool reminder to clients if they're passing they need to let the brokers know so just good etiquette and stuff yeah Athena I do have a interior design and home remodeling business that I'm trying to get a call schedule with the broker I just got the sim today and emailed the broker so that's something we have it in in the pipeline for Jason oh that's good that's that would actually qualify for SP or Jason so but they both kind of would fit that so that's good okay cool

44:00 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Great. Did we capture all of them?

44:04 - Luke Gillespie
  there anyone we didn't talk about today? A-H.

44:09 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Oh, right.

44:13 - AcquiMatch Team
  So A-H, well, actually Luke did say that he's gotten an off-market schedule call for me next week with them.  I had a write-up I did right before I went on break. We were trying to get a second meeting scheduled this week, although I haven't got a response head from him.
  ACTION ITEM: Follow up w/ unresponsive broker re Andrew's deals in Oklahoma - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/207117637?timestamp=2674.9999  He said the owner is like trying to like get some things that we need, 2024 financial. So I'm trying to get that scheduled, just waiting on him.  And then there's a business broker who seems to have a decent amount of deals in Oklahoma, but doesn't seem to like want to work with Jason or with Andrew for some reason.  Um, they just seem they kind of like don't get on calls. So Andrew was like, hey, what if we just like be more aggressive there?  I was like, all right, that's fine. So I reached out to the broker. was like, hey, look, like we asked about this.  Like, you kind of said you didn't think he's qualified, but like, I think you should just get on the call and meet with him and just get to know him.  And then you can understand if like he might be a good fit. And so he's like, okay, I haven't signed an NDA.  I was like, I haven't signed two NDA's. But here it is. You know, would you be open to jump on a call and I can arrange that?  I can make that introduction. And then he hasn't responded to me. That was just last night or yesterday did all that.  And then today he has not responded. So I'll follow up there. But oh, he just responded. Oh, no, that's another Jeff.  Okay, but so that's what I'm trying to do. I'm trying to get him in front of that. recursion, maybe increased deal flow.  But that's kind of where I'm at. What about new deals as far as the new year, Luke?

46:08 - Luke Gillespie
  Has anything come in for him? He's had a little bit of light deal flow that I've seen recently. Let me look at RFI's are actually there were like four or five really good oil and gas companies that looked promising that came in today.
  ACTION ITEM: Update HubSpot list w/ recent deal activities; clear backlog from new year - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/207117637?timestamp=2784.9999  One was like a safety training for oil and gas.

46:29 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  He was a sales trainer.

46:30 - Luke Gillespie
  He loves training. Yeah, so hopefully that one will work out. Yeah, I should have more updates for you on Thursday.  I've been so backlogged from the new year. I haven't had much of a pulse on the notion deal flow, but I should clear everything out tomorrow.

46:52 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Great. On the Jason L.O.I. I think I gave you my feedback on the. the telegram. like his modeling doesn't match the offer.  like, and he also put in that like high number of CapEx, the downside. So like, I don't, I can't actually see if the debt service works at the number that he's saying on like a no change scenario.  And in that one, he had like 10% seller note in the LOI, it's 5%. So I think it's just better to check off the modeling that is not the crazy catastrophe modeling.

47:36 - AcquiMatch Team
  Yeah.

47:37 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Because I've only seen that one where it's like negative 8% 100,000 CapEx and and then the debt service looks pretty bad.  But he also put in 10% seller note and then 5% in the LOI. So did all my feedback make sense on the telegram to you on that?

47:55 - AcquiMatch Team
  Yeah, except for the consults say, so like you were saying, you know, if I've already paid 30,000. And then I have 70, know, like, what do I do?  put in 70,000 there. I was.

48:07 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So if he wants the money that he's paid us to count towards the equity injection, he needs to put in the full 100,000.  And then he can choose whether that the UK gets reimbursed back to him, right? Like that can go towards working capital, or it can stay in and count towards his equity injection.

48:29 - AcquiMatch Team
  Okay, that makes sense.

48:30 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  how do I look at that in the model? So the money, the money that's due to us. Um, let me see if I have the, oh, I think I closed it should simply.

48:44 - AcquiMatch Team
  Do you to see my screen?
  SCREEN SHARING: Athena started screen sharing - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/207117637?timestamp=2930.554428

48:46 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Because I'm. I got it right here. Okay, so this number. Like he puts in the full amount of the hundred.  1,000. This is his 10% for whatever. So whatever he's paid us at the time of close will be deducted against this because he's already paid it.  So if he's already paid us 30, then he only needs to come up with an additional 85,000. The money that comes to us is only what's due to 70,000.  No, he could put in 70,000 and just have it be awash, but then it's not necessarily a deal expense.  He doesn't get the depreciation of deal expenses across it if it's not necessarily like all wrapped up in this.  He would just need to make sure that that it's all there. So it makes it a little bit cleaner in terms of being able to depreciate all the deal expenses and everything if he puts the full amount in there.  But for the purposes of modeling, I recommend putting in the full amount and just knowing that whatever you paid us, the amount, yeah, like the amount here is going to be including what he's paid us.  because he's already already paid that and it's something that's being used in the total project cost. if he's paid 30, then it only need to come up with 85 close.

50:13 - AcquiMatch Team
  Okay, where's that one? That's what he put in for his equity.

50:19 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  That's like what he put in for the amount that he wants to pay as his equity.

50:24 - AcquiMatch Team
  I see.

50:26 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So it's coming out at 9%. It really should be you know, it needs to be at least 5%. But then he's also got 10% over here.  And then oh wait, no. Sorry, this is a template.

50:41 - AcquiMatch Team
  This isn't his.

50:42 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  I'm just showing you on the model. So like they decide how much they want to put in and that's a number that like can be edited.

50:48 - AcquiMatch Team
  So anything in the. So whatever his equity, okay, what an equity search or just discount whenever he's already paid us.  So let's say 30,000. So it's just one 15 minus 30 there.

50:59 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Yeah. like put the full amount in and then what you've paid us will count towards your equity ejection. And then we only get paid what the balance is at time of close.  the bank will cut a check to us for the 70K that's due.

51:13 - AcquiMatch Team
  Okay. Got it.

51:15 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Makes sense?

51:17 - AcquiMatch Team
  Yep.

51:18 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Awesome. Good work. You guys, it feels like we have some good momentum. Let's clear up some things with some clients.  And then I'm excited to hear how the deal resource meetings go later this week. See if we can get that you know deal flow coming into the pipeline even better.  But in the meantime, it sounds like you've got some good plans to kind of pump that while waiting for an internal resource to be able to support that there.  Anything I can do to support you guys or anything else I can do to help you at this point.

51:51 - Luke Gillespie
  I ask one really quick question before we hop off or a deal when we are doing the 25 year emerald for real estate when the price of the real estate is more more
  SCREEN SHARING: Luke started screen sharing - WATCH: https://fathom.video/calls/207117637?timestamp=3115.566224  the business you instructed me last last time before before the break that so excuse me not things a lot okay so I would change the amort to 25 and he said I can change the loan rate to six percent yep okay and that counts whoops that counts for the business and the real estate six percent for both if they are doing it all in the same loan okay that okay that that's great so now I know when I'm doing this kind of shallow type of pre-deal modeling I know to do six percent in 25 year amort for a real estate deal if the real estate is more than 51 percent of the yeah so this is this is the scenario where you can do that if the real estate is less then they might decide to do separate loan for the real estate at six percent amortized over 25 years and then the current rates actually with what the current SBA will

53:00 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  So the we can update that. think it's around 10 now, um, but like, so for the quick deal calculator, if the real estate is more than 51% then you can do the 25 year and it's 6% and you need to say like this is when you're doing the real estate and the business in the same alone, but you may decide to separate them out and that those will be different terms.

53:23 - Luke Gillespie
  Uh huh. Okay. Yeah, awesome. That's all I have.

53:27 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Good question.

53:29 - AcquiMatch Team
  Cool.

53:30 - Luke Gillespie
  I gotta jump this. By the way, I'm sorry. That that officer will deal with Jason. just checked the side channel.  He said on December 19th that Eric got back to him and they scheduled an initial call. So I don't know if that's happened yet.  Maybe it's in the future, but you could bring it up in the call.

53:44 - AcquiMatch Team
  Thank you.

53:45 - Athena Simpson (Unrestricted)
  Okay. Okay. luck with Jason. I'll send him a note that now that I've reviewed it and caught up with you, so he knows that I've also looked at it.  can tell him that we touch base and you're feeding back our combined feedback. That's good. Okay. Good luck. Okay, thanks.  See you guys. Thanks guys. Bye
