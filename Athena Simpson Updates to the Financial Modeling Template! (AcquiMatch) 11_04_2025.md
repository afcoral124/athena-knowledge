# Buyers Club Replay 11/04/2025

[00:00:00] 



**Athena:** Thank you. Long time, no talk. 

**Gil:** Been ages. 

**Athena:** Hey Steve, how's it going? Justin's here. Awesome. I think Chris might be there somewhere too. Chris, are you there? Awesome. Yay. I haven't seen Chris tomorrow. Um, cool. Welcome, uh, to Buyers Club today. So, main focus is gonna be showing you all some of the updates to the, uh, financial template, but also wanted to take a minute to spot like Chris, talk through some of the deals that he is got going on and, and troubleshoot.

Theres, there's some exciting stuff. Well not troubleshoot, just strategize. Um, and then we'll dive into the, the financial model 'cause there's been some updates. So y'all have been giving us some great feedback in terms of where you could use some clarity. I've been in there working it too, so it made some updates, uh, that just have it easier to, to see things and see where you're at with that.

So I'm excited to show that to you, but, [00:01:00] um, quickly wanted to dive in with Chris. So Chris, you've got three exciting deals in play by the sounds of it. So how's it all going and how can I help? How can we help, uh, in terms of where you're at and what the next steps are? 

**Chris:** Good. Well maybe just making sure. I think I'm.

Ticking all the boxes, but maybe doing a quick sanity check and we can start there. 

**Athena:** Yeah. Why don't you go through it one by one. Just give us a quick update so everybody knows. Yeah. 

**Chris:** So the, the one I'm most excited about, it's really two. 'cause I think one went under, went on when, uh, under contract really quickly.

And then there's another that I haven't heard, I keep chasing, but I'm taking the broker silence as a possible now. So it's really two irons in the, you know, that, that are keeping up. So there's this off market, um, opportunity that you guys brought to me. Um, it's, uh. 94-year-old niche distribute distributor based out of the [00:02:00] New England area, headquartered in Massachusetts.

Um, so that's exciting in itself, right? Just the fourth generation family business. Um, they've been very open. So I've been interacting, interacting with the president of the controller. They together they own 50%, uh, a stake in the company and then there's Uncle Bobby or some distributed against other family members.

So that is not necessarily a risk, but something that I will keep in mind. I am, I book my tickets. I am set to visit to a site visit this Tuesday we've landed. So I'm flying outta Barcelona to Boston Sunday. Hopefully not too jet lagged and, you know, taking Monday to do some work and catching and then. Um, Tuesday, the plan that, that I've laid out for them is after 1:00 PM whenever they choose.

I think that's the only thing that's open. Um, they tell me a time, I wanna spend some time in the [00:03:00] operations, we're gonna cover it. That out evaluation consultant, something like sort to just to, 'cause they, they got their real estate appraised a while back. So I think that that would make sense. Um, and uh, then I, after I get to see them in person, see the operation, I wanna, I said, let's go to a social setting and hopefully break bread.

So I'm, I've sort of set the scene that we either grab a beer or do dinner or do something. They're, they're blue collar Boston people, right At like, something like that. Either pizza and, you know, or some Italian food. And, uh, well you could argue Irish, but I'm thinking Italian food is probably what they'll go for.

And, uh, and then having some beverage and talking about sports. So, uh. Part of the homework I need to do for that is I, I have a sense of their demeanor and their, uh, sort of mindsets. Just one is very process driven, very, you know, very methodical. The other is more people, um, just keep, you know, [00:04:00] uh, sort of doing a mind map of both of them and then bringing some questions or some things that I, that I wanna inquire about.

But the whole point is really form. We've spoken twice, it's always ended with, they like my energy. They feel like I could be the next chapter of their company. They've said that verbally, which is a good sign. I think now it's like, okay, let's, let's talk a little that where, you know, we've identified some areas of opportunity, sort of getting a sense from them.

It's almost like they're giving me the strategic projects or the strategic opportunities themselves. So, which I like. Um, yeah, so that, that's sort of that deal. And then after that, um, I would. Go into the model I I and then do some underwriting and, you know, it looks good, but formalize an LOII, I've, yeah, I'll pause there.

I'm sure you have questions, but, uh, that's sort of the first one, and that's the one that's excited me the most. That's the one that [00:05:00] you, 

**Athena:** um, so the, um, to bring everyone else up, up to speed. Ryan had to work on this lead for a really long time too, so it's exciting that it's, it's such a great, it feels like such a great match.

Um, so just timing wise, okay. You land, when do you land? Last 

**Chris:** Sunday afternoon. Okay, good. I, uh, I, I've given them where I, when I land and when I return and, uh, proposed Tuesday to be safe. Like, uh, like, you know, but if giving them Monday, if they wanna meet Monday, I'm, I'm game as well. Right. But I, they said Tuesday works just fine.

**Athena:** And when do you leave? 

**Chris:** Uh, Wednesday evening. 

**Athena:** Okay. So I would almost tee it up in your head that if Tuesday goes well, you have an offer ready that you could tweak after that meeting, and then go and meet them in person with the offer on Wednesday, if you can make that happen. [00:06:00] Because I find that like talking it over, you know, like in person is mm-hmm.

Is a, it feels less like negotiation and more like collaboration. So I would tweak it, have your computer there and be like, Hey you guys, I loved meeting you. I'd, you know, done some calculations. What I'm thinking, so like, here's what I would like to present to you as an official offer. How does that feel?

You know, and like you can even start. So we were just, I don't know if Andrew's here, but we were working on, on this with him, like, uh, have you read, never Split the Difference? Are you familiar with the concept of Great. Yeah. So starting with your low offer coming up, so it's 65% coming up to 85% and then landing on a hundred percent, which is like an exact very like, thoughtful number.

Um, but you could, you could bring your laptop there and update it, or you could like scribble on a piece of paper or [00:07:00] whatever. Um, but I find that the, the offer is, is much better landed if, if you can do it in person. And then it's a collaborative thing because they have to kind of respond to you there in the moment.

And like, you're there in person. You flew over from Barcelona, like there's reciprocity also at play. The fact that you've like made such a big gesture for that. So just something to think about there in terms of, I always like thinking like, what's the outcome that I want from this step? And the next step and the next step.

So the outcome that you want from Tuesday, it sounds like you wanna get under the hood of operations. See if you can see yourself in that business. Get to know them a bit more. Get some stuff answered. See if there's any glaring red flags. Like, my gosh, when you walk. When you walk the business with an owner, like either you're like, this is so exciting, or like, oh my God, I don't know if I can do this.

Right. Um, so I would say, uh, also for the team I'm looking at [00:08:00] Anka and Luke here. Might be worth getting some time blocked out with Ryan before and after that meeting, so you could strategize and work quickly. Like if you don't, if you think you need it before. Yeah, great. Maybe like after that meeting on Tuesday or Wednesday morning, maybe to just be like, here's what happened, here's what I'm thinking.

I'm gonna go and meet him again today with an offer. Um, so we can, we can get that blocked out with him now, just to have it there if you feel like you need it. 

**Chris:** Yeah, I think, yeah, I think Monday might be a good, like pre, pre-meet. I, you know, I'll be in regular ESD hours and um, it should work. And then, and I've sort of.

This is a priority. If I need to, you know, block work or, you know, that, that's fine. Um, but yeah, I think that would be good. And then for this one, it's been interesting 'cause Ryan's and mine, so this is a good, uh, how do you, my Spanish is getting in the way or spending too much time speaking the other [00:09:00] language.

But, um, it's a good primer I guess for me because, uh, I purposely, the exercise here has been not to get too in the numbers so that we could have built, they, these are folks that they go to work in polos, they go to work in, you know, they, they, they self describe as not no ego, not uppity. They wanna, so I've just, I've worked the man or the men in this case, the two of them.

And, and really, you know, I had, I went way back. I spoke about my college days and how I, I. Talk my way into being in an operating room and being scrappy and all these things. So that's really how we bonded. It's through my meeting. Scrappy, not thing to do with corporate finance or, or technology, anything like that.

**Athena:** I think that's the right play and, and the right thing to do on the first meeting too is like get a sense of the operations break bread. Like that goes so far. And then you can be like, Hey, you [00:10:00] know, I'm only in town for a little bit of time. How, how would you feel about getting together and talking what an offer might look like?

Right? And like, so it's, it's just a natural, like next step. Like I'm here. I, I'd love to talk about this with you in first person so we can like, see what, what feels good to you. And then I can go away and like do some more work or whatever. So you don't need to make it formal in that Wednesday meeting, actually, and Brian's closer to this, 'cause he built that relationship with them like over almost a year.

So he'll know the right play. But I, I think it is better to start talking numbers in person if you can. Yeah. And maybe just schedule it for the Wednesday so it's not muddying the purpose of what Tuesday is all about. 'cause you wanna, yeah, you'll on it too and be like, okay, how do I feel? But if you do the numbers before then, then at least you'll have a kind of rough idea on like where you can land and then on, you know, so like Tuesday is like, Hey guys, it's going really well.

I'm, you know, you know I'm gonna be flying out. What if we got together tomorrow [00:11:00] and started talking what you, you talk in some numbers, you know, but like, just to see how you're feeling about it. So then it can be casual after that conversation you can go away and put something together, more formal. 

**Chris:** No, definitely.

Yeah. This, uh, I will get something up and, and we have, they, the good stuff or the good thing is that an offer has been cushioned. They, they have a range as to where it might come in, so it might be as well just like, hey, start, you know, positioning it and then giving like, yep. Cool. I'll, 

**Athena:** cool. Well, the team won't get you scheduled in with Ryan too, so you can, you know, he's, he's back on Monday, so they'll get some time blocked out, uh, it sounds like Monday at some point.

And then, uh, Wednesday morning so that you can follow up with the sellers in person on Wednesday if you want. Uh, and then if you know you don't need the time or you don't feel like you need it, let us know. But I'd rather block it out in a schedule now, um, since you only have a window of time that [00:12:00] you're there.

Uh, and then what other deals would you like to chat about? 

**Chris:** So there is a Second deal is, it's a roofing company called Creative Solutions based out of Colorado, which, uh, I think the reason I I was successful was, again, play sort of the, um, the sellers basically describe, you seem cool, you seem nice, uh, every we have two offers, but those people seemed weird.

Those were his words. So just take make of that, whatever, whatever you wanna make. Um, however, uh, I don't feel comfortable, like I'm gonna submit an I-O-I-I-I don't have the tax returns. Um, and, uh, there's a few things that seem iffy. So I, I mean, I have like a quick calculator that, you know, they, although they have a lot of money, uh, uh, or SDE, it is, uh, so let me take a step back.

My mind is racing here. [00:13:00] So on this one, it's more about maybe me shooting over, uh, over Slack where I think the numbers, what, what I think this is worth, and then a whole lot of like, you know, validations that would need to happen. Um, but the seller meeting went well and I asked questions, but there's, I, I had the coaching from the broker.

I service expect, suspected that because it's wonky, they somehow they're paying themselves in commissions and it not, not you would expect like an SCORP distribution, which is what I'm used to seeing. Um, I think they're, that's why they're having problems with SBA and people, I use the word, I think they feel like every time they speak with a potential buyer, it feels like a cavity search, basically, because people just go very numbers.

So I purposely stayed a little bit away of that, but. Um, there's a lot of questions, right? So ultimately it's a, [00:14:00] it's a roofing company, but it depends. I call it, it's a sea, it's a restoration company. They restore damaged roofs based on hail in Colorado, and they have Right, a relationship with insurance agencies and they, they're really good with State Farm, for instance.

Yeah, but that's also a double-edged sword. They, that means that those relationships and those sales are tied to that owner. His name is, uh, Daniel. And then, um, although they have a healthy amount of money that they make that, or discretionary earnings, that it's a seasonal business. They only work between April and November, give or take.

And, uh, it's dependent on seasonality, storms and relationships. And, uh, that was it in the sim, but it's really two people that I'm replacing, not one. And I've been quantifying the numbers of the, of her, Danielle, the, the, the [00:15:00] wife. And, uh, she, it's almost like part-time bookkeeper and also director of operations.

Like she maintains all the SLAs, the, the contracts with the insurance agencies and, and sort of that their licensings are, are in place. How so? Nothing, the numbers seem good enough with all the contingencies that I'm putting there. Like if I had to hire all these things, there's still something there. I just don't have enough to like, well, I haven't seen the tax returns and I, I called the broker today.

I sent an email yesterday and haven't really, uh, he, he basically said, just give us an indication by the end of the week. So that would be tomorrow. Um, IOI am not too, too worry, but uh, yeah, so I think, uh, I would cushion all of this and just made an offer, make an offer in line with that. I think. Actually what Luke had put in the right it like about 10% less, or, you know, something along those lines [00:16:00] asking is 2.5.

I'm thinking too probably. Um, 

**Athena:** so, uh, you're the, you're, you, you tend to like, I ois and I'm not a huge fan of 'em, so why am IOI in this situation versus going straight to LOI?

**Chris:** That's fine. Yeah. No, no, no. Yeah, I could just do the template. That's fine. Use the template. So 

**Athena:** the, the reason why I don't like IOI is because they, they're not, they're not taken that seriously and sometimes they're used against you, so they'll take your offer and then they'll go back to somebody that's, and so, you know, obviously there's a lot of stuff that you're not seeing, it sounds like.

If the broker's saying, you know, you can't really move forward or have more meetings or whatever without an offer, then they know that once you get the offer in place, that things are [00:17:00] gonna change, right? Like you're operating off the information that you have available, um, with the commissions, you know, if, if, if it's reported.

I mean, they're gonna have to report it as income. So if it's reported in the tax returns, then I don't know if I'd be that concerned about it. There's 4,000 SBA lenders, right? So like. Just if one has looked at it and is not comfortable with it doesn't necessarily mean it. You need to find out if it's an SBA disqualification versus that lender doesn't like it kind of thing and can't get comfortable with it.

But we can deal with all that post LOI also, most of the time, and I don't know why they do this, because it's the first thing, you're gonna need to be able to see if you can get lending as a tax returns, but a lot of 'em aren't comfortable sharing tax returns before you've signed an LOI. So it's normal that they wouldn't provide 'em to you.

So given all that, if it's competitive, are there other offers on the table with them? Have they gotten other offers? [00:18:00] 

**Chris:** They had, when we had the call, they had two. Yeah. So they sort of disqualified them on the call. Right. Not by not liking the, the individuals. 

**Athena:** Then at this point, if I were you, I would get out the template that I'm about to share with you all, do your modeling right.

Share it with us so we can look at it and, and you know, look at the, you know. Potential issues in the deal and, and what kind of offer that you could put forward that like covers that and makes you comfortable. Um, but I would submit an LOI, um, because they have other offers that are likely in the form of an LOI and then you just caveat it with the broker, like, I'm operating off the information that you've given me.

So I'm hoping the tax returns reflect all the information that you've given me. Also, if there's two owners and you're replacing two owners, there should be a negative add-back in their numbers. If there's not, then that's a broker. No-no. And we can again, help you reflect [00:19:00] that in the, the, um, you know, financial forecasting so that your offer is based on an adjusted SDE or EBITDA that includes replacing one of the owners.

'cause you have to, you're one person that's standard. So we'll double check on the add backs and um, I know we're gonna be chatting a little bit about that today in the financial templates, like. Just add backs is a section, but, um, you know, you should take that into account. Like you will have to replace them.

You'll put that in the numbers and then you do your valuation based on that. Does that make sense? Yeah. Cool. But it sounds, sounds like an interesting enough one and you're kind of like, if the numbers work and when I get under the hood, it's not like super crazy. It might be an interesting one too. So I I think it's worth keeping an iron in the fire with caveats, right?

And like just operating with as much information as you can at this point, knowing that if the information materially changes after you get [00:20:00] tax returns and the other information that you're asking for now that, that the broker knows there'll be a retrade, right? But sometimes they're just. The, the sellers themselves don't necessarily understand that, so it's better to get them under offer.

And then it's like the banks will be like, no, you have this problem and, you know, dah, dah, dah, dah. So it's like that sometimes the brokers put things out there and let the market educate the sellers instead of them doing it. 'cause sometimes they're, they're not able to get there with the sellers themselves.

**Chris:** Cool. No, that, yeah, that's good feedback. Thank you. I will, I will do that. 

**Athena:** Awesome. Great. Well, we'll, uh, we we're gonna be sharing the template in just a few moments, so you can get in there, whip your numbers up, share 'em in the channel, and we'll review 'em before you send over an offer if you'd like. Um, cool.

And then is there another one you wanted to chat through or those are the two main ones right now? 

**Chris:** No, those are the two that there's, uh, I mean, just as an update, there was one that I had submitted an, an offer, the form of [00:21:00] IIOI. It, I think they liked, the broker liked me enough. I. That we, they had passed, um, but they went with someone else who did an all cash offer that didn't close it came back, but now I think the person was, was spooked a little bit.

I didn't meet the seller. It just made a generic. And, uh, he went with someone local. He's like, ah, he sort of wants to see the person. And I think he knew like, well if New York, you know, they, they saw my, my address as New York, which is the where I, I still pay New York taxes. So, um, I think that probably scared them off.

So probably not, not the, not the match right now. So that, that didn't go anywhere. And then I'm still waiting on a Colorado based, uh, snow cap business. But I'm assuming that given the silence, I'm assuming that's also a bus. 

**Athena:** Got it. Well let Luke know if he can do any assistance there to see if he can get ahold of him.

He's always happy to chase him on his end too. Um, see if we can get some [00:22:00] insight like on what's going on. Um, and then the team will set up time with you, uh, and Ryan next week to kind of pre-game before you're big onsite meeting. Um, and then, you know, send over the financials if you can get that. I know they wanna answer by the end of the week, so it'll be pretty quick turnaround, but if you can get that, send it in the channel, we'll have a look over it and give you any feedback there too.

Um, but I, you know, as long as it's a very comfortable number, like I don't see any problem in sending an LOI and you just tell the broker like, Hey, you know, I, I, I'm wanting the tax returns. So if there's a big difference, you know, we're gonna have to adjust it post LOI. 

**Chris:** No. Cool. As as you go, just to being conscious of time and that we're almost halfway through, um, when you go through the template, could you speak through like if we were to leverage private lenders, how the, what assumptions to make in the [00:23:00] template?

**Athena:** Absolutely. Yeah, great question. And um, I was chatting with Gil earlier and to everybody else watching as I go through this, the whole intention is to get you guys comfortable. With how to do this. So if you're having a question on how to do things either in the template or just overall a concept, like please flag it with us.

'cause um, you know, if you're thinking it, chances are somebody else's. And, and I have what's called the curse of knowledge. So I've been doing this stuff for so many years now. I forget, I don't forget, actually, I remember the first time I had to take a p and l and put it into a modeling template. I was literally like tearing my hair out and I was like, this, like learning French and I don't wanna learn it, you know, like, it just sucks.

So please, you know, that's what this session is gonna be about. I'm gonna show you guys some of the new features and things we've cleaned up, but, um, raise your hand or dropping questions in the chat as we go through on things that you'd like to cover from like, just a [00:24:00] concept or in the template. Just like that.

So I'll make sure to do that, um, as we go through and, and you know, I know it's like. I don't think anybody's like this, but like, it's like, oh, I should know how to do this. So I'm afraid to ask, like, please don't do that. Like this. This stuff is so complicated and and difficult to learn, so if you're feeling it, chances are somebody else's too.

So what we wanna do is make you all feel comfortable with the numbers so you know what you're signing on the dotted line for, for a very big life and purchase decision. So, without further ado, let me pull this up. Um. So, um, just a reminder, we, we make this available to clients only, so please don't share this with anybody that's not a client.

Um, and, you know, make copies of it for other folks. I don't think y'all do that, but, um, this is a perk of being a client just for you. But you do wanna share this with, you know, lenders, lawyers, like your deal team, [00:25:00] et cetera, so that they can see where you're basing your assumptions off of. I'm just gonna go through tab by tab real quick and show you the changes that we've made and then deep dive into some of the concepts and how you can use it.

Um, so again, no change on, on this. You're just gonna input a few things, uh, on the financial tabs. Again, no changes here. You're just gonna. Enter the financials as you see them from the p and ls as far as you wanna go back. Now it will be to your benefit to do the previous three years, uh, because we've added a feature for you to be able to look at the debt service coverage ratio as a look back.

So seeing if this is what lenders look at, they see if the business can handle the debt payments for the previous three years. And that's one of the reasons, or one of the things they use to make a decision on, on lability. So we've added that feature in here. So if you have the previous three years, add those in and then your, your TTM [00:26:00] also if you have it, if not, just do the exact same for the most recent year that you have deal structures where we've made a lot of changes.

So, um, I. You, uh, there's no change here. You can still choose if you wanna select the purchase price or use a multiple of the adjusted ebitda. Um, you can add these numbers in if you want, like what you have available for the transaction and what your expenses are. So blues are like nice to have, you can add them in.

Yellows are like, you should definitely add this in. So for those of you where there's equipment of any sort or any investment into the business, what you want to pay attention to is your depreciation number over here. And it, it's gonna show you what the average is. So we're averaging out, um, the depreciation.

Uh, so that's this number [00:27:00] here and that's, you know, a really bad way. But like a, the, you know, the best way that we found when you can't actually see what the, um, accounts payable, accounts receivable, uh, and, or, sorry. Balance sheet in this, in this instance, if you don't have access to the balance sheet to see what they're actually investing, then you'll wanna enter in, you know, just the average.

It's not automatically pulling it in because you, you, you know, we want you to be able to add in what you think you're gonna need to. Just keep business running as usual. So maintenance CapEx is like, okay, I've got a car wash and I know every five years I need to replace the equipment entirely. Right? So you wanna account for that.

Um, and then your working capital requirements of the business. So like what do you actually need day one to take over that business and keep paying all the expenses as usual until you start getting paid by customers? And there's two things you can do here. There's the working capital [00:28:00] requirements of the business, the working capital that you wanna add into, you know, that, that you wanna make sure you have.

And then what the seller is going to leave in the business as far as working capital. So if they're leaving none, and then you can just change that to zero and um, make sure that you have enough working capital in there. Right? Um. Then your equity injection again the same. So you can do a percentage or you can put an amount.

Most of you are not going to be doing investor equity or seller rollover, so I'm not gonna spend any time there today. This hasn't changed. Um, for those of you that have some real estate, this hasn't changed as well. But this is where you can add in real estate. Um, and it's gonna tell you whether it can be included in the, um, so here, actually, here, fair market value, add the value of the real estate and then it will tell you whether it's eligible to include in the seven a loan or not.

[00:29:00] Um, so Gil, I'm looking at you 'cause we were just talking about this earlier. So if you have real estate in the deal, add the amount that they're saying is that in there and then it, you can pull in, uh, your loan amount here, um, if you wanna do the, in the real estate, separate from the overall purchase price.

Does that make sense? Yeah. Cool. Um, so also something that we've added as a feature is the debt service coverage ratio is, uh, there's a third line. So, you know, there's three, or currently like 2D SCR lines in the sheet, and it's calculating what the S-B-A-D-S-C-R is. And then if you have a seller note, and we've also added in A-D-S-C-R for line of credit.

So this isn't something to worry about too much, but it's something that the lenders look at. Like if you were gonna fully draw the line of credit that we're giving you, does it [00:30:00] break the debt service coverage ratio? So, like SBA needs it to be above 1.15. Um, and you know, the, the, the years going off there.

So you want to have a line of credit. Please, please, please always ask for a line of credit from your lender. It sits in a bank account or it sits in an account. You don't have to draw it down, but it's much easier to get it before you take over the business than after. And you heard Nan's story, so we just having access to cash is important.

Um, also for those of you with 4 0 1 Ks that you're not using towards your purchase, uh, remember there's folks like Susie that can do a robs for you. Uh, and within 30 days you can use your 401k as capital infusion into your business or towards your equity injection. Um, so, you know, just making sure you have extra pots of money available.

Um, and then the interest rate is typically the same as whatever [00:31:00] your loan is. But I, I've put in 10% here. Now this is where I'm gonna spend some time on today, is the seller notes. Um, so as you'll remember, each of these columns is like no change. Best case. Worst case. So I like to first start with orienting 'em all the kind of same, and then just doing different forecast assumptions, which I'll get to in a second.

So for the purpose of right now, I'm just gonna say all of these are the same. So then you can look at, okay, if we have like literally no change, if we have a best case scenario and a worst case scenario, and we've structured it all exactly the same, what does it look like? So with this first note, this is a note you can use towards your equity injection.

So with SBA. They want 10% of the total project costs, but as we know, if we can get the seller to take like a 5% note, we can apply some of that towards the equity injection portion [00:32:00] and reduce the cash upfront that you need to bring to the deal. As a result of that. What has changed here is we've removed the balloon payment because you can't do a balloon payment on the equity injection portion.

So for SBA to treat it as equity injection, it needs to be on full standby for two years, and it needs to be paid over the life of the loan the same as they do. So the seller can't get paid back the equity injection portion before the bank gets paid back their payments for the loan. So this is just related to seller notes that you're using for equity injection.

Does that make sense for this one? Cool. We removed it so it wasn't confusing. Then let's say you want to do additional seller note, but you only wanna apply 5% of it towards standby. This is just a straight up seller note. You [00:33:00] can do a balloon payment if you want. Um, you can choose what amount of the purchase price you want to use.

Uh, standby. Typically on a seller note, you're gonna start paying after one year, but you can do it less time, like six months if you want to, and then just adjust your repayment period. Typically, you wanna do it over the life of the loan though for the 10 years, um, and a lower interest rate, and then you can or cannot do a balloon up to you.

Right? But this is, this is seller note that's not counting towards your down payment with the bank. There's no contingencies to it. You're just getting a note at a lower percentage point than you do with the bank. Yeah. Gil, you have a question on this one? 

**Gil:** Yeah. Um, the balloon payment is if, if I say yes, is that an optional yes.

Or is that a yes? I'm doing it in the five years. 

**Athena:** Yeah, it's gonna pull it in the, the calculation, like [00:34:00] if you have it marked as Yes, with a number in here, it will pull it out in the calculation as if you're paying the whatever's left on that note in five years time. 

**Gil:** Okay. 

**Athena:** So if you don't wanna do a balloon, I always start with no.

And then if they push back on the seller note, then that's a tool that you have to offer 'em. It's like, well, hey, I could give you a balloon payment in five years, how would that sound? Because some of them are like, I don't wanna wait 10 years to get all my money. It's like, well, what if we treated it as if it was a 10 year loan?

So that helps my cash flow in the first couple years, but in five years time, I'll pay you whatever's left on that note in, it's in its entirety. So that's a negotiation tool. It's not something I usually lead with. Steve, did you have a question on this part? 

**Steve:** Sort of, so from this part, since you're talking seller notes, you showed the DSCR before on the other page.

Yeah. And it accounted for this without the seller, just the loan on its own. Then [00:35:00] it accounted for the, with the seller note. Are, are, is that factoring in the first two years of no payment on the, um, so it's all factored in. That would be, uh, okay. 

**Athena:** Yeah, let's show you that right now. So we've added this cool thing where you can see the look back.

So if you don't wanna look at the previous years, you can just hit that little minus sign there and then going forward. So your, uh, equity injection, the seller note one, the standby, see there's zero payments there. And then in year two or year three, sorry, that's when your payments hit. So the debt service coverage ratio is taking that into account and the all debt includes all, like both your SBA loan and all seller notes.

You'll see there's a little drop there in year three. Oops. Sorry. A little drop in year three, um, because you've added a, a little bit more debt [00:36:00] in with that, that payment that starts on the equity injection portion. Great. Questions. Um, keep 'em coming. So did that clear that up and I, I'll go into forgivable notes.

**Steve:** Clear as mud.

**Athena:** Oh, I hope it's a little like, you know, maybe just like a little bit of like mud on the windshield after this rather than like completely coated. But, um, okay. So forgivable performance notes. Uh, I, this is a real strong caveat, like this can't always be used in every deal. Um, I'm gonna invite someone to talk to us in the future that can like really deeply break down performance notes.

Um, 'cause there's, there's different things you can attach 'em to. Normally what we're attaching 'em to is revenue and getting the revenue back up to something that happened in the past. So that's why it's different than an earnout. An earnout is incentivizing the owner to [00:37:00] get the business to where it's never been before.

That's not allowed with the SBA, you can use a forgivable performance based note attached to revenue. When they had that in the past. So let's say they had a, you know, after Covid there was this catch up year where they had amazing numbers and then they normalized after that. So it appears like a spike and a drop.

So that's kind of, covid, I think is, is actually giving us like tools that we didn't have before. 'cause a lot of businesses caught up and had an abnormally high year and then they normalized after that. So you can use a performance based note if you see any spike in the previous years and then a drop in a year after that.

So when you see that, think I have that tool available to me. There are other things that we can attach performance based notes to, like customer concentration or key employees or those sorts of things. For the purpose of this spreadsheet, we're only attaching it to revenue. So you only have revenue [00:38:00] as a performance note option if you are, um, looking at a previous year.

So. There are two different things that you can do with the performance note. You can say, I want you to hit 15% revenue growth in year one and year two, and if you hit at that, then you get paid the note. But some people might be like, well, what if we get 10%? Then you could be like, well, I'll do it Prorata.

So that means you pay the portion, you only pay a portion of the note that they, that they actually achieved. So let's say you're like, okay, I want 15% growth year on year. And they're like, well, if we get over 5%, we wanna be paid something. So you can say, okay, the minimum is 5% in order for you to get paid anything on this [00:39:00] performance note, you'll get all of it.

If you achieve 15%. Does, does that make sense so far? Yeah. Okay. So if, if it's anything over their, their previous year, then you can just hit zero so you can, it doesn't have to be five, you can hit it as zero. So it's like, if you achieve anything over last year, I'll pay you something. Right? And then this spreadsheet is automatically gonna calculate the portion.

If you've selected Prorata or you're like, Nope, it's 15% growth or nothing, you know, then you select Target. Does that make sense on what Prorata versus Target is? Cool. I'm seeing no hands up, so I'm gonna assume that's a yes. I'm seeing Steve, Steve nodding his head. Then this typically is done on like the first two years of, you know, like one year really isn't enough.

Two years is enough time to really, you know, transition the seller out and have them involved. Um, [00:40:00] if it's only based on the first year, then you would put. A hundred percent in year one. So it's like, what is the payment, the percentage of the performance note to be paid. So if it's only on the first year achieving it, then you'd put a hundred percent.

If it's, you know, 50% of the note on year one, it will automatically calculate 50% on year two. Um, something we've been talking about on one of the deals is like if there's a high owner dependency, then like you'll do 25% in year one. 'cause you're gonna have them involved in the first year and then the business needs to survive without them in year two.

So we're gonna, we're gonna wait it on the survival of the business achieving those metrics. Does that make sense in terms of the percentage? Like how you make those, you, you weight it. So if it's all only based on the first year, then you put a hundred percent there. If you wanna do it over two years, then you'll do 50%, [00:41:00] 50%.

Justin looks like you got a question. 

**Justin:** Oh, you're on mute. I think this was, yeah, thanks. This was in reference to the previous section. The, uh, something came to mind. So, performance note percentage. Um, that is the, what is that? Actually, 

**Athena:** that is a great question. Um, and something I should have covered off, so each of these percentages when it says seller debt percentage, seller debt percentage, performance note percentage, that's gonna be a percentage of your purchase price.

So you'll wanna model your, like on a, like, you know, so it's like, okay, well if you can help me achieve 15% year over year, I'll give you a four x. So you would model it off, like you, you're gonna put in your like advantageous purchase price to the seller. Like, I will give you a four x if you help me achieve those things, [00:42:00] but 20% of the purchase price is gonna be reliant on you helping me hit that performance.

And if you don't help me hit that performance, you're gonna get 80% of that purchase price. 

**Justin:** Gotcha. Alright. So it's just a, it, it's a percentage of the purchase price, I mean, generally just simply put 

**Athena:** Yep. Got it. And then it's, if, if, then when we get into these forecast assumptions, you can see like, okay, we're putting 15%, like best case is like they achieve those targets and this is the only scenario where you're gonna see those performance note payments come out.

In the modeling, which is why, why I wanted to have these like three different scenarios. 'cause it'll be like, okay, well let's assume, assume nothing changes in the business, can offering a four X with a 20% note survive if they don't help me hit those? Or if we have that J curve and like, you know, so that's, that's where you can play around with [00:43:00] it because the performance note will only get paid if they hit those targets.

So that's in our best case, you know, and we can switch it. We wanna do prorata in all of 'em. Like that's why I like orienting it around the same metrics on the, on the deal structure. And then you do these different forecast assumptions to say like, okay, well what if nothing changes in the business? What if they do help me do that?

And then I sustain a 10% growth for every year after that? And what if. Revenue drops by 10% the first two years, and then it doesn't grow at all the next three years. And then maybe you get a 3% growth after that. And then we're also able to add in these, these operating expenses decreases or increases. Um, that makes sense.

**Steve:** Yep. 

**Athena:** Cool. Great. Good questions. Um, then on the performance note, again, you can add a balloon payment. Um, so just something on the balloon payment to bear in mind is your business might not be able to sustain a [00:44:00] balloon payment just with the cash, but you can refinance at year five and get someone completely out.

So you wouldn't model that in the, you would just say no, but you can offer 'em a balloon at year five, just knowing that you're gonna go through a refinancing process. For whatever debt is left, and then the seller will get all of the cash and you will then have a new loan that's amortized over, you know, 10 years if you do it with SBA.

Does that make sense in terms of balloon payment options? So like if the business is doing gangbusters and Yeah, you might be able to like, you know, on the best case scenario, add yes and do it at five years to see like, would the business be able to pay it without me having to go and get another loan to refi them out.

Um, but on the big, big notes with balloon payments, I, I just leave it as no and I just assume I'm gonna get an SBA loan at five years for something like 5%. You should be able to balloon if the business is [00:45:00] doing all right at five years. Yes. Gil? What's your question? 

**Gil:** Uh, the balloon payment for this one, if we're paying on line one 14 and one and one 15, 50% in year one and year two.

What balloon payment is there after five years? I thought the, that loan gets paid after two years. 

**Athena:** Great question. Okay, this is where it tripped me up to. Um, so I should have explained these other two cells. So, um, what this assumes is that 50% of the note is gonna start calculating after year one, and then your repayment period is a years of amortization After the performance note target is met.

So in this scenario, 50% in the note payment is going to start after year one with eight years amortization and fif. The other 50% will start in year two with eight years amortization at a 7% interest rate. So [00:46:00] that means let's show you what that looks like 'cause it's in best case,

so you'll see your performance note payments. In year one, it's half in year two. There you go. It bumps up a little bit. Yeah. So you're gonna be paying that over the next eight years after that. So it's gonna be the, the total life of the loan, but only a percentage of it will start getting paid. So then you can model out over the, the amortization period in this deal structure, you know, if you wanna do it over nine years or I, I put eight years because you're gonna start paying portion of it in year one or if you wanna pay it all after two years.

So it's like, well no, you need to, you know, um, prove it, that it can do it for two years and if it does it for two years, then I will pay this, this note out. Then you would put 0% in year one and a hundred percent in year two, and then it's amortized over eight years. [00:47:00] With 7%. Now, if you wanted to balloon that out, that's where you're still doing, just like above, you're doing an amortization, you're paying it as if you're paying it for eight years, but at year five, you'll pay them whatever is left on the loan.

So it helps your cash flow in those first couple years. But again, for something like, like if you're doing like a 20% performance note, I mean, we can look at what this looks like. Let, let, let's see what it does to, to see that if the business can handle it on its own or if you'd need to potentially, um, yeah, see you're just on the edge there in year five, and it would use all your available cash assuming you hit all those metrics.

So you'd probably wanna refi, you know, just to not put yourself in a pickle cashflow wise. Or you could pay, you could decide how much cash that you pay, and then just refi whatever you don't want to pay in cash out of the business. That answer your question, Gil? 

**Gil:** Yeah. Perfect. Thank you. 

**Athena:** [00:48:00] These are great, great questions.

Um, I'm still super geeking out about this spreadsheet. I love it so much because it's, it's all things that I've just been, I've been wanting these little buttons that I could just toggle and put these numbers in and like be able to do this. So, um, any questions on this deal structure tab before I move on?

Feeling good? A little nod or thumbs up? Yeah. Can I 

**Chris:** just gonna ask, I know this is general knowledge, I just can't remember, but on the real estate, can you remind me, seven A is, if you are, is if it's 51%, you know, you're basically bundling in one loan business and real estate, and then 5 0 4 is just the real estate.

Is that, is that correct or have I correct. Okay. Yeah. 

**Athena:** So let's, let's say, let me give you an example here so you can see how the numbers work. So let's see. How much are we offering? We are offering, okay. 5.5 [00:49:00] million. So let's say, I mean, obviously SBA won't go up this high, but let's say the real estate is valued at 6 million.

Mm-hmm. Then it tells you that it's, you know, so if the real estate is more than 51% of the SBA loan, then you can use the, you can include it in the seven A loan and amortize both your business and your real estate payments over 25 years. Now that can be good if you're offering a high multiple on a business and you could use the breathing room of have everything like amortized over 25 years, which means you could probably offer more to the seller.

Um, if you were not on Nash's call or didn't a see that one, uh, he actually restructured it. So he offered less for the business, more for the real estate so that he was able to make the real estate more than [00:50:00] 51% and then he was able to amortize the, you know, $6 million. His deal was over 25 years instead of, you know, 10 years for the 3 million for the business in 25 years for the 3 million in real estate.

So sometimes you can have some negotiation with them to be like, I'm gonna undervalue the business and overvalue the real estate so that I can get, I can give you more money and I can get better amortization. The downside of including it in your, in your seven a loan is that it counts. Accounts towards your SBA 5 million limit as an individual.

But if you, if you buy, if you wanna buy another business, if you do it in another, I, I, I, I can never understand how people pronounce this. Any CIS code, na NACE code, I think is what people say. I'm like, but it, that's not how it's spelled so that it trips up my mind. But if you buy it in a different industry, then you can access another 5 million pot.

So that is, [00:51:00] that is the loophole for being able to buy multiple businesses is as long as it's like the first three digits I think are different, you can access another 5 million pot. Um, so depends on what the deal calls for. If you're needing to make like a advantageous offer in a higher multiple, then including it in that loan can then get you a 25 year amortization, which is how you're able to edit it here.

So. Let's just say real estate is 6 million and, and you can amortize it over 25 years, right? Then then your debt service might look a lot better over time because it's amortized over 25 years. Um, does that answer your question, Chris? 

**Chris:** It does. I am, uh, I have a FI have a, yeah, but I don't wanna monopolize, you know, the, the deal I'm looking at that has a, around maybe more than $10 million in real estate.[00:52:00] 

Yeah. So I'm, I option, ideal option sale lease back. And I've consulted at commercial, I have friends that do commercial real estate and they gave me like a few questions of things I should know. And we've asked for the, the entity's financial returns as well. But, um, if that weren't an option, if the business couldn't sustain.

Those rent, the rent to, to use that strategy. Um, hence why I'm asking here. Um, just to get a sense, 

**Athena:** they've been paying themselves fair market rent. That's what we wanna, 

**Chris:** they've been paying a little bit. And, uh, roughly like, I mean for set, for six properties, I think it nets a little bit over 500 K. 

**Athena:** Yeah. So if they've been, if the owner's been paying themselves like market rent.

Then you should be able to buy the real estate without breaking the debt service coverage ratio. And then it comes down to whether you have the cash available to put down the down payment to buy all of the, the [00:53:00] real estate, how comfortable the bank feels with that kind of exposure going over it. Um, but yeah, with that much real estate, there's a lot of options that wouldn't be available on, on normal deals, one of which is that sale lease back, which is an interesting play, you know, 'cause it's an enormous amount of real estate that you're looking at.

Um, but let's say that the real estate is like 25% of it, then you would just put in like, like let's say it's 3 million for the real estate, then you have the opportunity here to put in, um, completely different terms for real estate and it will calculate into the, the document as an additional, um, debt source.

Does that make sense? So your, your 5 0 4 is gonna be your real estate. Let me add that in.

Wait. Cool. 

**Chris:** Thank you. No, that, that does help. Thank you for, for refreshing my, my memory. No 

**Athena:** worries. Okay, cool. Um, so, oops, what am I [00:54:00] doing? Let me not break it. Um, then let's let, so what I like to do first is just like, okay, what's the idea? What are they asking, right? Like, what do I know will make them happy?

Let me, let me do all terms the same and then orient around the business performance, doing different things after I take it over and see how that looks in terms of forecasting. Um. I like leaving no changes. Like just, there's literally no change in anything. Like, let's say the business just continues to perform as usual, then my best case will be like, you know, if I'm, if I'm thinking of a performance note or if I'm thinking like, when, when we're falling in love with potential, right?

What's, what's potential look like? And reasonably like, if I'm getting excited about this and I'm falling in love with the potential of it, let me, let me indulge myself in that. Um, and then worst case is like, okay, let's account for a J curve. Like what kind of J curve could this thing survive? So, [00:55:00] you know, in the template it's gonna be pre-populated with these percentages.

And then when you go over to the, um, forecast tabs, there's a few little different things here. So. First is, um, I've asked our, um, amazing modeler to pull through the sources and uses so that you can see on every tab, no change. Best case, worst case, like what, what does this all look like? What equity am I putting in?

What are my investors putting in, et cetera. Just like on the old template, I thought that was really helpful. And then to see, well, how much cash at closing is a seller getting? What overall debt are they taking? What are my deal costs, et cetera. Um, so that's gonna be on the top of every tab, and it's gonna be based on what you put in each of those columns.

So remember, it's like no cost, it's no change. Best case, worst case, it just goes 1, 2, 3. Then it's gonna be on the tabs here. Um, and then in addition, I, we added the previous year's [00:56:00] financials in here, so you'll be able to do a look back and see. We will, if the business performs, you know. Like this is the no change scenario.

So it's looking pretty healthy. Under these, under these terms. If I were to put this debt burden on the business in the previous years, what does that look like? Now you can see where this looks like, you know, actually in previous years it's fine, but if there's no change in the future, like e um, so with these scenarios, you're gonna be clicking through and just seeing like, okay, if I get the best case, what's it look like?

And again, you can click at the top here to like, look at the previous years. It's gonna pull through what the debt's gonna look like, um, and all the payments. So this is the one where the performance note starts getting paid. Um, worst case is like where we have that J curve and it's starting to look [00:57:00] scary.

Like how many years could we survive that? And it's like, okay, I. We just about make it through. We're not gonna bankrupt ourselves. This is a 10% drop in revenue and like 5% increase in expenses in the first two years. And like no change in the next three years. And it's like you're still kind of okay.

Right? So that's what we wanna know. It's like if the worst happens, are we gonna be able to pay the bills? So anything below a one is like you, you're, you know, you don't have enough cash. And this is also pulling in line of credit automatically to when you need it. So this third line is your line of credit, DSCR, which is le what lenders look at.

And it needs to be over 1.15 according to SBA. Justin, I see you have a question. What's, what's coming up?

Oh, you're still on mute. 

**Justin:** One day. One day I'll learn those forecast assumptions, um, that [00:58:00] are feeding these outputs. Is a cumulative effect based on those cells year over year. Correct. So it's effectively saying, you know, in year one you have a 5% best case or a 10% best case, a negative percentage, worst case, so on and so forth.

Right. So in 20, like in your example on your screen, so 2025, best case. 15%, 15%, then the 20, 27, 10%. Um, so big growth initially tapering off or regulating, I guess for the subsequent seven, eight years. So this is a, each year is a subsequent percentage change off of the aggregate of the year before, correct?

Yep. Okay. Correct. 

**Athena:** Yeah. So 15% off of 2024, and this will be 15% off 2025. Right. And 10% off 2026. So it is building on every year. 

**Justin:** Okay. Can I, and this is probably a very silly question. I was working [00:59:00] through this with Ryan and neither of us could figure it out. And when we were going through the no change, we pretty much standardized, no change.

Like, you know, wasn't a lot of growth, was a lot of, you know, uh, increase in operating expenses. So not a lot of downside, not a lot of op upside, pretty much like same old right on the outputs. We, we kept seeing the DCR decrease pretty dramatically over the course of the, the 10 years. And I was asking go, you know, what's contributing to that?

And we were trying to go back to like, figuring out the why of it all. And neither of us could figure it out. Yes. Do you know 

**Athena:** what, what was happening before, and I've actually had him clear this up for, for all of our purposes is all of the loan payments, et cetera, et cetera, were were being added to operating, uh, expenses.

That's how PE does it, because it's gonna be an operating expense. So it's been pulled out. Ah. So this is when you add the 10% in [01:00:00] operating expenses, it's only gonna go towards actual operating expenses. And then you'll see there's all these additional things here, which is basically like. Taking the interest out and adding it back in.

Like, you know, these sorts of things that you're gonna need to do to, uh, calculate like what's free cash flow and, um, tax expenses and stuff like that. So that is one of the cleanup things that we did, because I was struggling with that too. I was like, I just wanna know if my operating expenses are the same as the year before.

And he is like, I gotcha. So that's been cleaned up in this model, so. Gotcha. These little plus and minus signs are basically, okay, we gotta pull your interest in depreciation out, and then we gotta add it back in so that we can get to our, you know, proforma adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow that can go to everybody after our tax distributions, et cetera, et cetera.

Okay. So you'll see now in this no change scenario, it's pretty stable. 

**Justin:** There we go. Okay. Yeah, that explains a lot because we, we not, we were like, okay, if nothing changes fundamentally, why? [01:01:00] Why is our ratio dropping when it should? If anything, it sh we're paying down principle over the course of the loan and it doesn't make, it didn't make sense, but now it makes sense why it was calculated the way it was.

Okay. 

**Athena:** Yep. Um, and then also, you know, some of those, those note payments are gonna come in kind of later. So that's, that's where you're gonna see that drop in. Like 

**Justin:** sure if there's like a, a year one random year drop, like change, that makes sense If it's, that's when the performance note kicks in or something to that effect.

Okay. Yep, that totally makes sense. Now 

**Athena:** that's all been changed and also the seller notes were calculate, or the performance based notes were calculating a little odds, so we cleaned all that up too. So, um, it's all been stress tested in the, the, the performance notes now. So that should, um, be pulling through your worst case scenario in this situation.

Um, you know, you'll, you'll see it's like, uh, you know. What I like using the worst case for is [01:02:00] like, you can go into the forecast assumptions and just stress test. Like, well, can it what, like what happens at 20%? You know? Um, and then, then that helps you go back to your overall deal structure and adjust so that all three of those scenarios make you feel, I mean, the worst case should make you feel uncomfortable, but you don't want to be in a situation where you have a 3% drop in revenue and you're bankrupting yourself in your one.

So it just allows you to kind of see where the, the edges are. Like, okay, if I'm falling in love with potential, like what could this potential be? Let me put that in best case. And if I'm like, you know, also being mindful that there's probably gonna be a drop and some additional expenses in year one and year two, how much, what load can I put on it based on the asking price that I'm offering?

Based on the purchase price that I'm offering. If it's a very tiny load, then we either need more, you know, cash available or we need to adjust our purchase price. So you see [01:03:00] how using these three different scenarios, like it indulges, the like fantasy side of like, if I do everything I think I can do with this business, that's our best case.

No change is like we, we just wanna make sure the numbers work. If like absolutely nothing changes. And then worst case is like, we don't wanna look in that tab, but we should, you know, we're outspending a lot 

**Justin:** of, I'm spending a lot of time in that tab. 

**Athena:** Not too much though. Right? So just making sure that, you know, IIIA 10% drop, like this is pretty, this is pretty gnarly, right?

To have like a 10% drop and you know, 5% increase on expen. Like it's putting pressure on both sides. So, um. You know, I, I like doing that. So you can kind of see, um, and then in best case, you know, like this is like no changes to operating expenses. And then let's say [01:04:00] we get some efficiencies in the first two years, and then actually we're gonna increase it a little bit to match this growth and make sure the growth is there.

Um, so you can mess around with that. So in the template, it has these kind of sample forecast assumptions. 'cause this is, this is how I would do it. Or if I wanted to like, you know, do a reasonable no change, I might do zero in year one and year two, and then a 3% growth year over year, which is super conservative.

And like investors, lenders, private debt, et cetera, are not gonna, you know, be like 3% growth after two years of no growth. You know, it's, it's reasonable to assume that that's the case, but then it also shows them that you've kind of looked at the worst case too. Um, I know Chris wanted me to show for private debt how that would be different, but any questions on what I've shown you all so far?

Are we excited? We've got a little bit more clarity, a little bit more, little more tools in the toolkit to be able to like look back. I know this [01:05:00] doesn't, it's like, okay, looking back, whatever, but like, I was just really excited 'cause like lenders are gonna be like, wow, you guys really know your stuff when you start sending this to them and like, you've thought of everything.

Um, so that makes me excited that you'll, you will show up as very prepared, um, buyers and I joke with the lenders, I'm like, you guys want searchers to do stuff that like the owners can't even do, like, not even close. And they're like, oh, I didn't think of that. You know? So, um, anyways, Gil, you've got your hand up.

What, how can I help? 

**Gil:** Um, not a question about the sheep, the question about finances in general. Are you taking them now? 

**Athena:** What's that? Yeah. Yeah, we can do that. Let me, um. Go ahead and ask your question. And if I wanna like put a pin in that and go back to the Chris with a private debt, I'll do that. But let me know what your question is.

**Gil:** Yeah. Uh, I'm basically a little confused about add-backs and expenses. If you could dive into that a little bit, that would be great. 

**Athena:** Yeah. Great. Great, great. Great question. Okay. So Chris, uh, real quick, it's super [01:06:00] simple On the, um, private debt, you would just treat it as like, I would use the same, um, seven A loan and like private debt are kind of, they're pretty much able to match.

SBA worst case is gonna be 15% interest and usually they'll do 10 year terms. Okay. The benefit 

**Chris:** just helps 'cause I, I've heard, I've someone I know just. Well, I need to see if he closed, but he bought with private money and it was around these terms. But I, I wanted to make sure that, that, thank you. Just, just that.

Yeah. So 

**Athena:** when we're talking private money, it's private debt, right? Not investor money. Mm-hmm. 

**Chris:** Yeah. Yeah. It's, it, it, it was a, a lender, some lender that has entered a space and he didn't need, it wasn't in the millions, it was, uh, I don't know, maybe 300 k. It, it was he Okay. Yeah. [01:07:00] Yeah. It wasn't, yeah, and I think it was an interest close to, this'll get the, so for 

**Athena:** the, there's, there's a whole world, so there's a level above SBA, which is like independent sponsor model, where searchers go out and find very large deals and they raise capital for it.

And there's private debt funds, you know, so that they, they function as funds for their investors, but they're lending money rather than investing money as equity. I. Um, so I have somebody, uh, in my wheelhouse. They, they have an appetite for larger deals, right? So like, usually you're looking north of 10 million to be able to have a conversation with them in certain circumstances, which we're keeping an eye on.

Like there's a lender that's like an impact fund, right? So in certain areas or under certain circumstances, they wanna help [01:08:00] specific groups of people or they wanna help in specific areas and they will look at smaller deals. So, um, the deal that Andrew's looking at actually, like Oklahoma is one of their areas, for example.

So I'm gonna be able to like, facilitate that in introduction there. So when you guys are looking at your deals and, and depending on that, like, just know that we're always here as a source. You know, of like, Hey, we can make introductions to folks. We know people depending on that. 'cause every deal is so nuanced and capital is so nuanced, like capital being like money, right?

So there are folks that will lend privately, sometimes they are matching SBA terms, but like as a worst case scenario, you can model for 15%. The benefits of private debt are, they don't necessarily require you to put 10% down. They just want you to put in something meaningful. Um, and meaningful is gonna be different to every person.

In addition to that, [01:09:00] private debt typically does not require a personal guarantee. And I know that sounds attractive to everybody, but what it means is you are gonna be very highly scrutinized as an investible person. And, and SBA does this too. So it was one of the things that was just, you know, reiterated time and time again at s and Bash last week, and that we hear time and time again like, make no mistake.

They're looking at the business, but they're also looking at you, right? Do I have confidence in this person? Are they treating me well or do I have faith that they're gonna be a good business owner? Are they responsive? Are they on top of their stuff? Um, so SBA is looking at, at you for that and somebody, I can't remember which lender it was, but they said, you know, the thing that we spend the most time on discussing when we're deciding whether to approve a loan or not and doing the underwriting is the borrower, not the business.

So just something for y'all to bear in mind as we go through this, but with private. [01:10:00] Debt, they're gonna really be scrutinizing you, right? Because there's no, there's no personal guarantee. It's still an investment they have to prevent, protect their investor's investment. But, you know, getting a 10 to 15% return on your investment is much better than most asset classes right now.

So there's, there's these funds that will lend as debt on these deals. Typically, they have a bigger appetite though, they want it to be like north of 10 million and, and have other, other people in the mix, either in the form of a larger seller note or you bringing a fair amount or bringing additional investors that are counting towards equity.

But in this spreadsheet, Chris, all you need to do is just use the seven a loan section for that and then just change the terms. Thank you very much. You're welcome. Okay. So Gil, let's talk add backs. Great, great. Great question. So. Gil, if I remember correctly, [01:11:00] you were wanting to have a little deep dive on why is it coming out in expenses and why do we add it back here.

Is that correct? 

**Gil:** Yes. 

**Athena:** Great. Okay. So when you all become business owners, not if it's when I let my friend does this to me all the time, it's like if I become a, he is like, no, no, no. Win, win, win. So language matters when you all become business owners. You will have, if you don't already have business entities or things that help your tax situation.

A business is one of the best ways to, um, like. Create tax efficiencies for yourself. You know, it's not about how much money we make, it's about how much that we keep. So for almost every business that you all will be looking at, it is a lifestyle business for somebody because they don't have other things.

So this is their vehicle to create tax efficiencies for [01:12:00] themselves. If we run expenses through the business as an owner, then it reduces the amount of taxes that we're gonna have to pay come tax time, because these are all treated as expenses of the business. But you, the new owner, will get to decide whether you want to take those similar types of expenses through the business.

So add-backs are. Non-essential to the business operating types of expenses. So typically it's gonna be like, what is the owner taking as compensation? They've got their kids on payroll. This is legal for tax purposes, by the way, as well. So like if an owner has a lot of like taxable add-back or like tax efficient add-backs, I'm like, they know their tax strategy things like, you know, kids on payroll.

Um, I, I have a tax strategist that helps me, like all of my hair, my [01:13:00] nails, my outfits. Like these things are all event expenses because I have to go out and represent the business, right? And I need to look a certain way if I'm asking people to trust me, to take them through these kinds of like, life changing, uh, decisions.

So for me, that's great for people that have children. There's like tons of ways that you can add your kids on payroll. Legitimate. It's written in the tax code. If you put 'em in a photo shoot for your business, guess what? They're a model. They can go on your payroll. You can have like, you know, different funds for them and stuff like that.

So that doesn't throw up a red flag for me. When people are like, oh, I have my wife on payroll, or I have my kids on payroll, but they're not active in the business. That just tells me they're good at, you know, doing their taxes. There's other add backs that sometimes they will try to add in that you're like, hang on a minute.

So one time marketing expenses. No, sir. Like that is part of being a business. [01:14:00] And you have to try out marketing tactics, right? And they don't always work. So you cannot add that back and tell me that seller discretionary earnings, because I am going to have to invest in the business. I'm gonna have to trial things.

Sometimes they're not gonna work out. And that is not to me, an acceptable add back. So you have to discern it is, is it a benefit that the owner is taking? And I can decide whether, you know, some, some owners put their health insurance in there and they put the whole family on health. Health insurance.

Maybe you don't have kids, you're not gonna have that kind of health insurance premium, in which case that's extra cash for you to decide how you wanna spend it. To me, that's a justifiable add back, right? If they're saying like. This one time legal expense, like there was a lawsuit randomly. It's never ever happened.

It's weird. And we ran the legal expenses through the business. Maybe I will accept that as an add back. Charity and donations, you need to be [01:15:00] careful, right? If these are donations that they're making in the community and they're active in that charity and they're getting leads from being active in that charity, that's not a justifiable add back because it's a lead source, right?

So they'll try to slip these things in, um, and then, you know, if it's, if it's like the owner gets that in their bank account in some way, right? Or they're getting a benefit in some way and it's not essential to running the business, then typically it's a justifiable add back. Something that we were just talking about with Chris was owner comp.

So if there are two owners that are leaving the business, both are active. Across the line, like business brokers should not be adding back more than one owner's salary. Typically what they will do is they will add back both owner's compensation because they're overpaying themselves and then they will do a negative [01:16:00] adjustment like here, right?

And saying like, to hire a bookkeeper, you're looking at, you know, and if bookkeeper's usually part-time, whatever, like maybe you're paying 2000 a month. So they'll put a reasonable price in for, to replace what the owner was doing. See, that's what you wanna see. You wanna see like, okay, they put, let's, let's say in Chris, let's use Chris's scenario as an example, and I don't know his actual numbers, but let's say altogether both owners were paying themselves 300,000.

We would add that back because that's money that you have to now play with. But we know that one of the owners. Does bookkeeping and operations. So I'm gonna guess maybe $2,000 a month for bookkeeping. That's 36,000 and maybe I wanna hire an op person for 74,000. So then I'm gonna deduct a hundred thousand in the salaries.

I'm going to have to pay to replace one of the [01:17:00] owners. And then that leaves me with the 200 that you know, I, that that would be an owner's salary, right? Because I'm gonna have to pay money to actually replace both people. I am one human. I can't replace two people. So then you're doing all your calculations based off this SDE, which takes those things into account.

So how's that sounding, Gil? Does that demystify it a little bit more? 

**Gil:** Yeah. Yeah. That clarifies a lot of things that were going through my head. Yeah. Thank you. 

**Athena:** And Luke's good at like, you know, Luke and Ryan are good at like, looking through the add backs when y'all are working deals and telling you like, Hey, this seems like a reasonable add back, or it's a little sketchy, you might wanna double click on this one and see what that means.

Right? But like, they'll often add back like one time marketing expenses, like, no, no, no. That's just, that should be, and then, and then you need to decide how hard you argue that, depending on how much it is. You know, like, uh, Steve and Polly and I were just [01:18:00] talking about, um, working capital on a deal and it's like, well, how I, how much do you wanna try to educate the seller on the right way to do things and the broker, or do you just reduce the purchase price and be like, okay, no working capital, but I'm paying less money.

Or with the, the SCE, if they're like, you know, emphatic that they're not gonna like, you know, remove it as an ad back then you just lower your purchase price and you, you. We'll make those pro forma adjustments here. So that's what you do here. It's like, well, what? You know, okay, they're saying that's, that's the SDE, I'm just gonna give 'em a lower multiple and I'm, I'm gonna need to account for it somewhere.

So let's say that they were, you know, saying like, absolutely not, we're not gonna add it back. Other pro forma expenses, this is where you'd add it and then it will calculate going forward.

**Gil:** Perfect. Thank you. 

**Athena:** You're welcome. And then in the forecast [01:19:00] assumptions, I didn't spend any time here, but let's say there's one time things that you think you're gonna, like, I'm gonna have to do a salary bump for everybody. You add that in once and then it will just automatically calculate the percentage afterwards.

So if you know there's gonna be like one time expenses or like a big bump that's just unexpected and you don't wanna like do a overall percentage for it. Then you can add it in once and then it will automatically calculate on top of that too.

Does that all make sense? Any more questions? I know I've kept you all late, but this is, I like, I love this stuff. I'm such a nerd. I love being in the spreadsheets now, which is hilarious. Considering I was reliving the Nightmare with Gil earlier, I was like, I hated, hated, hated the first time. I had to like take a p and l and try to act like, you know, just where does this go and what is this?

And it's so frustrating. So we've tried to make it as simple as possible, right? Like just. To, to pull that in because when I, I [01:20:00] started doing this, I was actually going line item by line item through the p and l and trying to add it into a spreadsheet. And I didn't even have a template like this. I was like making my own when I didn't know what I was doing.

Like it sucked. It sucked so bad. So that's why I get so absolutely delighted with this. Now I'm like, it has everything I've ever wanted, you know, and I get to keep getting it updated because I have an awesome person that does it. So if there's things in here that you're like, God, I wish it had this, like, please tell me, I want this to be the Rolls Royce that is exclusive to you clients that you can't get anywhere else.

It gives you everything you need to be able to feel confident and excited about your numbers. So keep sending feature requests to us. If you, if you have questions about things, like send it to us. Like this isn't just Athena gets to geek out. Like the whole purpose of this is we want you all to feel.

Really confident and, and like you have clarity on the numbers and you understand how they work both in the deal and you know, being able to look [01:21:00] forward and just be like, okay, I feel like this best case is like pretty reasonable, you know, if I do this, then great, but like the worst case, I will also survive that.

And it makes the signing on the dotted line a lot less scary when you've like done all the scenario planning. So, um, that's the whole purpose of this is like, we wanna put some, a tool in your hands that you love, you know, maybe you don't love using it, but you can get around and use it and get what you need and feel a little bit more confident.

So any feature requests, any things that, that don't make sense, like, please don't assume that, oh, I must not be getting it. Like, sometimes, you know, as much as we try to do this, my God, we're human and, and we might miss something. So if you're like, this doesn't make sense, like what Justin was saying earlier, Ryan brought it to me and I was like, no, you're right.

That needs to be cleared off. So. Feed it back in the channels and the Slack channels. Um, you know, or you know, when you're talking to Ryan and we will make sure that we get that action. So, [01:22:00] um, awesome. Thanks Steve. Oh, Steve, uh, how? Oh, you, I think he dropped already. He's still here. He dropped. He had to go.

Damn. I already hear an update. Okay, so just real quick before we sign off, let me stop sharing my screen there. Anka dropped the, um, template on all of your dashboards, right? Anka drop it here in the, um, chat too, so you can all grab it if you're super excited to get working with it. Um, and then we will, we'll do a replay of this, uh, video, um, in the Buyer's Club channel if you wanna just like, revisit any of the points that I went through.

Um, but Steve and Polly, uh, took, took our advice of like doing a video that went along with the LOI when they, they, the, the. Seller was just getting overwhelmed with all the calls and they wanted to establish a relationship and it went really well. Um, so that seems to be a nice little tactic if, if you're getting stonewalled and not able to access that owner, like doing a, [01:23:00] a video to go along with your LOI to just humanize yourself and try to connect with them.

Seems like they got, um, you know, out of nine buyers, it seemed like they were getting more attention. I haven't had the update to see if, uh, that's progressed. Um, also, uh, so, um, I was gonna say this 'cause I've been using it with some of you. The voice note function in Slack. Um, and Justin, I know you, you discovered that today and you liked it.

So, um, if, if you have updates for us or questions or whatever, feel free to use the little, the little microphone function in Slack. Um, because I know, I mean, I have these crazy things and I love, I, I'm just a voice person anyway, so I like communicating in, in voice that helps me like kind of feel like I'm connecting and giving the right advice.

And, and I know sometimes it's like nuanced and there's emotions with it. So I like using voice notes. Um, you can do that back with us too, if you're like, Ugh, I can't be asked to [01:24:00] like type up all my updates. Um, just click that little microphone button in Slack and you can leave us a voice note and it automatically transcribes it anyway, so the team can either read or listen to it.

Um, but please use that or, you know, there's the video function too, and you can, um. Click the video button and it will allow you to like screen share. If you're like, I'm in the model, I'm tearing my hair out about this point, like screen share it and we can see, or like if you're in an LOI template and you're like, what about this?

So feel free to use all the functions in there. Um, we, we love it and we wanna support y'all as much as we can. And sometimes it's really helpful to hear what you have to say or, um, you know, if you show us what's going on. But ultimately, um, you know why I'm saying this is like, hopefully it makes you feel like a little bit easier to, you know, chat with us and talk with us.

'cause I know typing can just be annoying sometimes. So, um, okay. I think I've belabored the point there, but. I really love [01:25:00] sharing this with you all today. I'm excited for you to dive into those financials as you're getting, I know all of you are kind of actively working deals, so, um, make a copy on Google Sheets.

Have it so we can, you know, make comments at least on it and share the Google Sheet link with us if you want our feedback and want us to look at it. Um, we, we love doing that, so, and we want to be here for you. Everybody's kind of moving on deals that seem really exciting. So we're here, use US teams. All really excited about the movement and they're furiously working on more exciting deals for you as well.

So anything we can do to support you through this process, we wanna do that. And we want you to not be clients anymore because you bought businesses. So let us help you get outta here. Use all the tools. And door's always open too. If you have any feedback for how we can improve how we're delivering things, we all really thrive on feedback.

It helps us grow. Um, so if you see anything that we could be doing differently that would improve your experience, like [01:26:00] DM me or tell the team, we love hearing it. So thank you all so much. Please keep us posted. We all like literally celebrate all of your wins as a team. So let us know when good things are happening or what happens with all of these meetings and submitting Lois and that sort of thing.

Um, and have a great rest of your day. Exciting stuff. Thank you all so much. We'll talk to you soon. Thanks. Thank you. Bye Bye.
